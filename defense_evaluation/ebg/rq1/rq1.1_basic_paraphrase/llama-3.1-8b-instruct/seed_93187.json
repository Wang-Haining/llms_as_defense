            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "My goal is to pursue a career with the Division of Family and Children Services to make a positive impact on the lives of children who have been abused or neglected, and to provide support to struggling families. As a future social worker, I will uphold the core values of service, respect, and a commitment to improving relationships and personal growth, ensuring I remain proficient in my field. These values not only resonate with the social work profession but also deeply personal to me.\n\nThroughout my educational journey, I have always been driven to help others, but I struggled to identify a specific career path. During my time in high school and college, I witnessed individuals confronting their problems with denial or unhealthy coping mechanisms. The situations I encountered motivated me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, as I sought a deeper understanding of human behavior. Although I still felt uncertain about my career path after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, a life-changing experience that summer opened my eyes to the need for social work professionals. A friend introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was struggling with abuse at home, and I soon discovered that he had turned to the authorities for help. As I learned more about the situation, I realized the gravity of the issue and the importance of supporting vulnerable children. I decided to visit the boy's parents, where I expressed my concerns to the police and shared my recent graduation from Piedmont College. Although the law couldn't intervene, I was able to speak with the parents, and their dismissive attitude towards their son's situation only strengthened my resolve to pursue a career in social work.\n\nAnother essential value for social work professionals is advocating for social justice. Our society often touts the importance of individuality, yet we often conform to traditional norms rather than embracing our true uniqueness. I believe that if we value individuality, we should not be afraid to stand out from the crowd. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively challenged social injustice, expressing myself through bold fashion choices, public declarations of support for marginalized groups, and standing up against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it. As a future social worker, I will continue to fight for social justice and advocate for those who are marginalized or oppressed.",
            "This paper delves into the relationship between biological and sociocultural models as they relate to insomnia, a prevalent sleep disorder. The biological model examines the role of genetic factors and medical health aspects in the development of insomnia, while the sociocultural model explores the impact of environmental factors, including demographics, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity. This review aims to analyze and critique existing research related to these models, focusing on their strengths and limitations.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to mental health conditions, and sleep disorders resulting from medical complications or substance use. Primary sleep disorders, such as Dyssonmias and Parasomnias, encompass various subcategories, including Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and others. Insomnia can manifest as difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep, while Hypersomnia involves excessive daytime sleepiness. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are characterized by behavioral and physiological anomalies during sleep. This review primarily focuses on insomnia and its connection to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders highlights the significance of genetic and physiological factors, including the role of neurons in the hypothalamus that regulate sleep and wakefulness. Research on mice has demonstrated that GABAB receptors in these neurons play a crucial role in sleep-wake states. The activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and improved sleep quality. Studies have shown that GABAB agonists, such as baclofen, can increase sleep duration, suggesting a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. This research implies that genetic factors can influence sleep patterns, and alterations in the receptor could lead to sleep disturbances. The sociocultural implications of this study suggest that inherited phenotypes can regulate sleep, and disruptions to the receptor could have a negative impact on daily life, affecting aspects such as education, career, and daily tasks that require focus and attention.",
            "This paper covers three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it offers a concise explanation of the condition. Next, it delves into the diagnosis process, highlighting common warning signs or characteristics associated with CAPD. Finally, the paper concludes with strategies for a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom setting to support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to how efficiently the brain processes auditory information. Essentially, it is a disorder where the brain fails to correctly interpret sounds it receives. People with CAPD can hear normally but struggle to distinguish words, separate conversations from background noise, and differentiate between various sounds due to a problem with the brain's auditory processing mechanisms.\n\nThe earliest documented references to CAPD date back to the mid-1950s, when researchers described it as \"auditory imperception.\" In the 1950s and 1960s, researchers like Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari developed tests to assess children with communication disorders, while Kimura introduced dichotic testing in 1961 to study the brain's auditory processing mechanisms. A national conference in 1977 sparked further research on CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD presents itself in various ways, such as difficulty localizing sounds in space, distinguishing between multiple sounds, recognizing sound patterns, detecting changes in speech, and integrating sounds to form meaningful information. Individuals with CAPD may struggle to filter out background noise, interpret the sequence of auditory information, and respond to auditory clues.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, healthcare professionals use a combination of observational techniques and tests that assess auditory skills, including questionnaires, surveys, and behavioral observations. These tests often involve presenting patients with multiple auditory stimuli and asking them to differentiate between specific items. While there is no single, universally effective diagnostic tool, advanced tests may involve recording auditory signals and measuring the brain's responses.",
            "Twelfth Night suggests that while disguises can be useful for carrying out deceptions, ultimately, a person must choose to shed their disguise or risk losing their true identity in the process. However, this decision comes with a significant challenge: one may end up alienating themselves from others as a result. It boils down to a difficult choice between preserving one's own identity and maintaining relationships with those around them, as some might react neutrally to being deceived, while others may be offended by the deception. \n\nThe exploration of deception through gender role reversal in the play raises further complexities, particularly the underlying reasons behind a character's decision to adopt a disguise. In the case of Viola, her decision to impersonate a man is motivated by self-preservation, as seen in her statement about seeking protection in a foreign land. Although her plan is initially successful, it leads to her isolation from the women around her and creates complications in her relationships with others, such as Olivia, who mistakes her for her twin brother Sebastian, and Orsino, with whom she develops unrequited romantic feelings.\n\nThe play also touches on the idea that deception can facilitate the expression of suppressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages imply that these characters may have unacknowledged desires that are triggered by Viola's disguise. For instance, is Olivia genuinely attracted to Cesario, or is she driven by a fascination with masculinity? The ease with which she switches her affections from Cesario to Sebastian suggests that Olivia might be parodying the superficial judgments of her time, rather than genuinely harboring feelings for women. \n\nThis is evident in her later shift in attitude towards Cesario/Viola, where she no longer views her as a romantic interest but rather as a family member, as seen in her comment, \"A sister, you are she.\"",
            "The brutality of German colonial rule, particularly in the context of the genocide against the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa, has been widely noted by observers. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the German colonial empire was multifaceted, with varied policies, ruling styles, and geographies, making a single description inadequate. Despite this complexity, the German colonial empire's educational systems showed significant diversity. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a well-educated and literate African population. Similarly, German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies received praise from contemporary authors. \n\nIn stark contrast, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast, with the government largely delegating the responsibility of native education to missionary societies that received limited government support. Conversely, the government invested considerable resources in the education of Europeans, establishing state schools and heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, persisting even after the end of German rule. Unlike other German colonies, where a significant number of Africans were literate and educated, in South West Africa, the vast majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate. Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience, and this study aims to further explore these factors by examining new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is an extensive body of literature examining education in the German colonial empire, primarily written in German during the early 20th century. Early works focused on describing the characteristics of educational systems in these colonies. Later studies, written in English, expanded the discourse by conducting comparative studies of education in various German colonies and providing in-depth analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. One notable study, conducted by Cohen, compares the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa, discussing the factors that contributed to the disparities between them. According to Cohen, the presence of a large settler population in South West Africa was a key factor in shaping the colony's educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonies, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, despite a significant portion of the territory being arid desert. This relatively favorable climate led to a substantial European population in South West Africa, with approximately 15,000 whites residing there by 1913, compared to only 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The classification of popular music has become increasingly complex over the past century, with numerous genres emerging that it is challenging to comprehensively list them all. Furthermore, most notable genres, such as rock, jazz, country, and folk, have branched out into various sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, making the classification even more intricate. Heavy Metal, a sub-genre of rock music, has particularly grown to be one of the most diverse and expressive genres in the past four decades. It is characterized by its wide range of emotions, predominantly leaning towards the darker end of the spectrum. The genre's diversity stems from its early adaptability, which allowed artists to create their own sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, resulting in a continuous chain of new variations.\n\nToday, the heavy metal movement has expanded to the point where it is challenging to define what constitutes heavy metal music. It has incorporated numerous themes from other genres, but its origins can be traced back to a specific starting point. To fully grasp the extent of metal music today, it is essential to understand the underlying principles and motivations behind the metal movement.\n\nHeavy metal music can be described as a movement that embodies darkness, often characterized by increased intensity, volume, and theatricality. It is often associated with musicians who possess exceptional technical skills and musical proficiency, which is reflected in their music. Additionally, the genre has been influenced by the use of psychedelic substances in the 1970s, which led to the creation of innovative and otherworldly music. The genre's dark, visceral qualities departed from the more conventional emotional ranges of popular music at the time. Later generations of metal musicians drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's dark and intense qualities, as evident in the lyrics of various metal songs. For instance, the lyrics from Helter Skelter, a song by the Beatles, display the darker side of their music, which was a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier and darker song. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate their ability to produce heavy music, which they showcased on their album The White Album.",
            "Long before the Surrealist artists brought their dreamlike paintings to the scene, Henri Rousseau was shaping his own dream, literally and figuratively, with his brush. In \"The Dream,\" a 1910 Post-Impressionist masterpiece, we see not only a woman marveling at the wonders of a fantastical land but also Rousseau's own aspirations as an artist. For years, he longed for the recognition, approval, and admiration of his peers, yet struggled with an internal conflict that defined his career: the desire to conform to established art styles to gain acceptance, versus the need to stay true to his unique creative voice. His painting, \"The Dream,\" embodies this lifelong inner turmoil.\n\nTo truly understand Rousseau's motivations, it's essential to delve into his background. Born in Laval, northwest France, on May 21, 1844, Henri Rousseau came from a relatively affluent family. Despite this comfort, he received no formal art training and instead worked as a gabelou for the municipal toll service in France until the age of 40. Although he was called a customs inspector, his true passion remained painting, which he turned to as a source of solace after the tragic loss of his wife and eight children left him with only one daughter, Julia. Rousseau's work differs from that of his contemporaries, who romanticized peasants, as he sought to represent the everyday life and aspirations of the common man.\n\nGiven his circumstances, Rousseau's yearning for recognition in the art world is understandable. He began painting at an older age, with little education in formal art techniques, and produced works alongside more renowned artists of the time. It wasn't until around the same period when Matisse was establishing himself as an artist that Rousseau finally received the recognition he deserved. Jan Gordon notes in his book \"Modern French Painters\" that while Matisse and Rousseau were competitors in the art world, their motivations differed: Matisse sought to avoid clichés, whereas Rousseau aimed to create something conventional enough to be accepted by the prestigious Artiste Français.",
            "Many influential thinkers have long proposed a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, suggesting that truth and beauty are intertwined. I believe that there's a fundamental reason for this. John Keats' famous quote from \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" - \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know\" - hints at this connection. While our understanding of the world often comes from education and experience, we seem to intuitively appreciate ethics and aesthetics without needing to be taught. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to explain and describe rather than dictate rules, seeking to understand why certain actions are moral or why specific works of art are beautiful. \n\nCriticism and analysis of art or morality can never fully grasp the essence of what makes something good or beautiful. When discussing the value of a piece like da Vinci's Mona Lisa, we might focus on aspects like composition, context, or cultural significance, but these elements don't capture the underlying reason why it's considered great art. People often find it difficult to put into words why they adore a particular work of art, and instead say something like \"there's just something about it.\" Similarly, Flannery O'Connor noted that a story can convey something that cannot be expressed in any other way. No matter how thoroughly we analyze a work of literature, there's always an intangible, transcendent quality that remains unexplained. I propose that ethics shares this same property, as suggested by Ludwig Wittgenstein's statement that ethics cannot be fully expressed. This elusive, unexplainable aspect is the most powerful attribute of both art and morality, and it's what connects them. \n\nBecause both art and ethics touch us at a fundamental, experiential level that's difficult to put into words, they're closely linked. This connection is particularly strong when it comes to literature, as McKean pointed out, \"Literature is unique among the arts in its moral quality.\" While moral standards may not be relevant to other art forms like music, they're deeply relevant to literature and to life itself. As living beings, we're driven by values, and literature's importance stems from the values we find within it.",
            "Germany is currently a unified country with a distinct culture that spans from the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea in Kiel, as well as from Cologne on the Rhine River to Dresden on the Elbe River. This unique blend of culture is a result of the country's diverse history and the various tribes that shaped it. Germania, the ancestral homeland of the Germans, has a disputed etymology. Scholars and historians disagree on the origins of the name, with some attributing it to the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe mentioned by the Roman historian Tacitus. He noted that they were previously known as Germans before crossing the Rhine River and battling the Gauls.\n\nThe Roman leader Julius Caesar is credited with first using the term \"Germanus\" in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, which he used to distinguish between the Gauls and the Germanic tribes he encountered. However, the meaning of the term is unclear, with some believing it referred to a neighboring tribe in the Gaulish language, while others suggest it may have come from the word \"ger,\" a type of spear used in warfare. Another theory suggests that it may be derived from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were known for their loud and noisy nature.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote in his book \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" that the Germans were aboriginal and had not been influenced by other cultures through immigration or trade. He noted that the harsh climate, rugged country, and unfriendly demeanor of Germany would make it an unappealing destination for outsiders, and that the Romans would only send expeditions to Germania for trade and conquest, but would ultimately return to their empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the fringes of the Roman Empire, trading goods and skills with the Romans in exchange for their military service.",
            "I stood gazing down, my mind blank and taking in the scene before me without any emotional attachment. My thoughts were fleeting and unconnected, slipping in and out of my consciousness like ripples on a smooth lake. My perception of the world seemed effortless and fluid, as if I was merely observing without any personal thoughts or biases.\n\nEarlier, I had attempted to tap into my creative side by following the advice of an artist I worked with, who recommended the book \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had always been fascinated by drawing and this book provided a comprehensive guide, covering even the basics such as understanding the properties of a pencil and the brain's processes for interpreting lines. One technique from the book that stuck with me was the idea of framing a subject within a square, simplifying complex scenes into more manageable compositions. However, at that moment, I found it impossible to mentally impose such a frame on the present scene. The messy, overwhelming sight before me left me awestruck, and I stood frozen in wonder.\n\nAs I thought about it, I realized that I was standing in the midst of creating my own art piece, or at least, the beginning of one. Like the masters who influenced me – Picasso's blue period, Monet's love of greenery, or the Renaissance masters' vibrant palette – I too had a unique perspective to contribute. I had a vision, and the tools to bring it to life. With a surge of inspiration, my hand instinctively reached for the pencil, and my fingers began to move with a life of their own, bringing my vision into being.\n\nHowever, my creative moment was short-lived. My hand jerked and spasmed as I tried to dislodge the clogged toilet, and I was left staring at the stubborn brown mass that refused to budge. Clutching the mop, I stood frozen, my green tie constricting my neck, and my expression turned sour as I gazed at the unwanted surprise left by someone else. After a few tense moments, I stooped to grab the toilet paper and wrapped it around my hand like a protective glove, before plunging it into the toilet bowl with a sense of trepidation. The task was far from elegant, but it was a necessary one, and I proceeded with a mix of reluctance and duty.",
            "Teen drivers are facing a high risk of accidents, leading to tragic outcomes. Several interrelated factors contribute to this alarming trend among young American drivers. According to the National Institutes of Health, the primary issue lies in the fact that the teenage brain is still developing and not fully equipped to handle the dangers associated with driving. This inexperience not only results in a higher number of fatal crashes but also increases the likelihood of rollover accidents, speeding, and driving off the road. Moreover, when teens drive with their peers, the risk of accidents significantly escalates, as a study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a direct correlation between passenger age and the frequency of traffic accidents.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, California and other states have implemented temporary provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit minors from riding with teen drivers. However, these measures are only temporary solutions to a deeper problem. As a group, young drivers are, statistically speaking, unable to effectively manage the risks and responsibilities associated with driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman suggests that 18 is too young for a full driver's license, citing research that highlights a common desire among those under 19-20 to engage in thrill-seeking behavior. Delaying driving until this tendency has diminished is, therefore, a sensible approach. Continuing to issue licenses to young teens will only lead to more deadly crashes and a substantial increase in the death toll in the coming years. With millions of new teen drivers expected to hit the road by 2010, the need for effective legislation becomes increasingly pressing.\n\nImplementing legislation to address this issue is a relatively straightforward process. Schools can continue to provide driver's education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 should be allowed to operate a vehicle. A provisional permit can still be issued before a full license is granted, and a set number of practical driving hours can be required. The number of hours could be based on the existing requirements in most states, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice. A national, uniform approach to this issue would be a reasonable and effective means of protecting teen drivers across the country. The proposed legislation is not a new concept, but it is a necessary step towards reducing the alarming statistics surrounding teen drivers.",
            "While reviewing the early Edison films housed in the Library of Congress, I opted to examine the entire collection of trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. There were a total of fifteen films, which largely utilized creative editing techniques to create illusions. My study primarily focused on analyzing the aesthetic principles behind most of these trick films and identifying the distinct features that emerged in some of the later ones. The early trick films, which were produced at the turn of the century, were primarily set-bound, featuring static compositions, a static camera, and adherence to the rule of using one shot per film. However, a few films from the beginning of the 20th century began to deviate from these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne of the defining characteristics of trick films is their use of an interior set within a frontal proscenium, which was a common feature in both early cinema and vaudeville and magic performances. The camera remained stationary, following neither the movement of characters nor objects. This composition was inspired by the theatrical and vaudeville traditions. As a result, characters in these films often moved horizontally, rarely moving towards or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors entered from the right side, moving left and right within the frame. Even when they exited, the camera did not track their movement.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition also led to the use of long and medium shots, with close-ups being extremely rare in trick films. This stylistic choice was influenced by the theatrical and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance, framed within the stage borders. In these early films, actors typically remained in the middle ground and did not move towards the camera, making close-ups impossible. The majority of trick films followed the rule of one conceptual shot per film, limiting their length to around a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This constraint also restricted the narrative and dramatic potential of these films, with most focusing on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic and illusions. Notably, however, a single shot may consist of multiple joined physical shots, used to create the illusion of disappearance or apparition, as seen in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). A closer examination of this film reveals the moment when the physical shot of Mary's severed head begins, even though the entire film is perceived as a single shot by the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a strong advocate for Republicanism in its early stages. As an agriculturalist and briefly involved in politics, he became known for his unwavering dedication to individual liberties and government accountability. His agricultural background significantly influenced his views on governance, with his commitment to a rural way of life forming the foundation of his opinions on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to establish an ideal system of self-governance, free from the constraints of native traditions. He firmly believed in the importance of natural human rights, which he considered interconnected and equally essential. In his opinion, denying one right would undermine the value of all others, and governments should not interfere with these inalienable rights. Taylor equated the concept of the \"state of nature\" with the idea that those with physical strength and malicious intentions often held power, but he argued that in a civilized society, this should not be the case.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor thought that the government should acknowledge the inherent duality of human nature, encompassing both good and evil. He was unyielding in his belief in a dualistic morality, stating that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" Taylor defined good principles as those that safeguard private property, promote agriculture, and discourage capitalist exploitation. He believed that a government founded on these principles would function fairly, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by self-interest and avarice. Taylor recognized self-interest as a fundamental human motivation, but only considered it detrimental when it led to the creation of sub-groups that exploited others at the expense of the community. A well-designed government was necessary to balance humanity's natural flaws and prevent the introduction of adverse principles.\n\nLike many staunch Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, with a minimalist Federal government possessing only explicitly stated rights and powers. He was aware that an extensive Federal government would be costly and potentially tyrannical. However, he also recognized the dangers of a simplistic, literal interpretation, which could become corrupted without considering the original intent of the Constitution's authors. Furthermore, Taylor regarded the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it explicitly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking at Figure 17, we can see that there was a significant decline in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was a cause for concern, and pinpointing the reason behind it is challenging. The onset of winter on a New England campus undoubtedly led to a decrease in foot and bicycle traffic, which might have contributed to the decline. The end of the fall semester in December, when students were busy with coursework, assessments, and other tasks, could also have pushed the commuter log to the back burner for many individuals. Furthermore, the holiday season in December brought a longer break for students and faculty, reducing the need for campus visits. The low log submissions in January might be attributed to the preceding break. However, the persistently low numbers in February remain unexplained. It's possible that projects like this one experience an initial surge of enthusiasm, followed by a natural decline in engagement. To counter this trend, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week, a targeted campaign in March that succeeded in boosting log submissions for that month. One of the key challenges we faced was maintaining momentum despite the natural decrease in engagement and the unique challenges posed by academic breaks. \n\nAnother hurdle for this project is the cultural preference for driving a car, which offers a sense of freedom, independence, and flexibility. To overcome this, we needed to offer incentives for alternative modes of transportation. We provided gift cards to local businesses, including restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores, in an attempt to encourage participation. It would have been interesting to see how larger prizes, such as a bicycle or electric car, could have impacted engagement. Increasing the value of prizes over time might have been more effective in sustaining interest. While the initial gift cards were sufficient at the start, announcing larger prizes in subsequent months could have reversed the decline in participation.",
            "An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that tracks an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets akin to an index fund, but offers more flexibility and trades on an exchange like a stock. By investing in an ETF, you can reap the benefits of diversification, similar to an index fund, along with the advantages of owning individual stocks, such as the ability to short sell, buy on margin, and purchase as few shares as one in any transaction. Although these benefits are highly appealing, ETFs typically come with lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund. However, there are drawbacks to consider, including the commission fees associated with buying and selling ETFs, similar to those charged for stock transactions. Furthermore, ETFs offer a wide range of investment options. It is essential for savvy financial investors to critically evaluate the actual benefits, such as diversification, and their extent before investing. For this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to determine if the benefits of owning a single ETF match the advantages of a diversified portfolio of the same stocks and whether there are better configurations of the same stocks that would yield a more optimal risk-return profile.\n\nTo simplify the evaluation process, we have chosen to focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. Below is a list of the top 10 holdings and their corresponding percentage of total assets.\n\nTo gauge how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, to estimate the contribution of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consisted entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF's holdings. The calculations of Beta and Return are presented in the chart below.\n\nAs shown in the chart, a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings would yield a Return that is 6.11% higher than the ETF's Return, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF. From the results obtained so far, it appears that a portfolio consisting of just the top 10 holdings may offer higher returns with lower risk. However, it is possible that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different.\n\nTo further assess whether these portfolios are statistically different, we calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% for comparison with the ETF IHF's standard deviation.",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is one of Edgar Allan Poe's most notable poems, which heavily employs the term \"Thulé\" – a concept initially linked to Virgil's work. Virgil used this term to refer to an island north of Britain, which the ancient Greeks viewed as the edge of the known world. However, it's essential to acknowledge a more contemporary source that influenced Poe's use of this term. Poe was deeply interested in the works of German authors, particularly Goethe, whose writing often resonated with him.\n\nThe significance of this reference lies in its demonstration of Poe's familiarity with Goethe's works. Karl J. Arndt's book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\" points out the striking similarities between their poems, suggesting that Poe may have been inspired by Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts, with the second installment appearing in 1832, the year of his death. Within \"Faust,\" there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells the story of a king who becomes consumed by grief after his wife's passing and ultimately dies. The King of Thulé's character shares eerie similarities with the figure in \"Dream-Land,\" possibly serving as a dark parallel to Poe's own struggles with loss and addiction. Another adaptation of \"Faust\" was created by H. P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe's use of the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe referenced Thule twice in his writings, using the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land\" as its bookends. Reading \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" together reveals a striking connection between the two works. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a desolate landscape of Thule, haunted by deceased friends, and a world devoid of color. These scenes mirror the King of Thule's emotional state in Goethe's poem, where the king is overcome with grief and loneliness after his wife's passing, leading him to lose interest in ruling and living. This parallel between the two poems suggests that Poe drew inspiration from Goethe's work, as if he had stepped into Goethe's poem.\n\nAs a prominent author, Goethe was well-known and respected by Poe, in part due to his admiration for Tennyson. Additionally, since Poe was exposed to Goethe's work through various reproductions and adaptations that followed the original publication, it is likely that Poe was familiar with Goethe's writing even if not directly influenced by Tennyson's connection to him.",
            "To determine whether a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a California grocery store could recover punitive damages, the court would evaluate if the store manager's actions demonstrated a reckless disregard for potential harm. A customer, Jennifer Palmer, may have a valid claim if she can prove that the store manager, Paul Martin, was informed of the spill twice but deliberately chose not to address it for 30 minutes while he ate dinner. \n\nA judge is unlikely to dismiss Palmer's punitive damage claim without a proper review. To justify punitive damages, Palmer must provide evidence that Martin's actions were taken with a deliberate intent to disregard the probable harm caused by the spill, and that his conduct was also despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have anticipated the potential harm of the spill, given that several customers had slipped and fallen in the same store in the preceding months. \n\nAlthough Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable may not be strongly supported, it is still a reasonable claim considering that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009 and Martin failed to take necessary safety precautions. \n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, informed Martin about the applesauce spill; however, Martin responded that he was on dinner break and couldn't handle customer complaints. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin of the spill, but he gave the same response. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious injury. Before Palmer's accident, five slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D Markets in 2009.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of duty not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Under the California Civil Code, malice is defined as conduct intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" \n\nCourts have found conduct to be malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, especially when the defendant was aware of the probable consequences of their actions and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.",
            "It has been almost four years since I took a course in Islam at CBC, where a crucial topic of discussion was whether Islam is a hostile religion. The issue remains just as relevant today as it was back then, especially when looking at the events since 9/11. The media's perception of Islam has shifted dramatically from being hostile towards extremists to being overly tolerant in the US, and I believe this trend is a significant change. Considering the 2001 presidential election, it's unlikely that a candidate like Barack Obama, who has a clear Muslim background in his family, could have been a contender back then.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography has always fascinated me because it seems to contradict the common perception of his personality. Based on my understanding of history, I thought Muhammad was known for forcing conversions to Islam, conquering tribes, and imposing his faith on them. However, the biography portrays him as a misunderstood leader who was humble and self-effacing, which is quite different from what I initially knew. It describes how people gradually came to accept his teachings after witnessing his humility and kindness.\n\nInterestingly, there are some intriguing similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the miraculous events attributed to Muhammad. One such example is when he multiplied food to feed a large group of people. The way the story is written makes me think that the authors aimed to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, but simply lived a life of truth and performed miracles. This approach downplays the significance of Jesus Christ's life and miracles, and I find it problematic as it appears to be an attempt to borrow from Jesus' narrative.\n\nThe biography also includes many stories that seem to serve as proof of people's personal experiences of converting to Islam. However, these stories are often based on third-party accounts, which makes me skeptical. I believe that presenting these stories in this manner diminishes their credibility and raises more questions about their authenticity.\n\nWhat bothers me most about the biography is the way it portrays Muhammad as a godly, humble, endearing, wise, and gentle figure. However, historical records contradict this image of Muhammad, and I often wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true circumstances surrounding his rise to power.",
            "Christian thought rapidly diverged from its original teachings and principles after Jesus' death, and over time, a significant movement away from its core values became apparent.  However, as societal awareness and progressive thinking continue to grow, there's a prospect that Christians will return to their faith's authentic roots.  As people become more aware of the history of their faith, they will begin to distinguish between the original teachings of Jesus and the additional doctrines that were introduced over time.  This process will likely take several decades or even centuries, but it is inevitable.  Ultimately, the result will be a shift towards a return to the original form of Christianity, stripping away layers of accumulated doctrine.  As this trend gains momentum, particularly in the US and Europe, it will lead to a more uniform understanding and practice of the faith, reducing the current diversity of beliefs and denominations.  History has shown us that reversals of this nature are possible, such as the fall of Christianity from being persecuted to becoming the dominant institution in the Roman Empire, and the transition from slavery to equality for African-Americans.  A reversal of this kind is also anticipated in the Christian faith, which will involve seeking the sources of the religion and reducing diversity in the process.  To facilitate this, it is crucial to interpret Jesus' words metaphorically rather than literally.  By looking back into history, we find that the Jewish faith, which is the basis of Christianity, was already present before the Roman Empire's rule in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish community was initially united, but later divided into different groups such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people, showcasing a lack of unity among them.",
            "The Jungle by Upton Sinclair vividly portrays the inherent selfishness and self-centered nature of humanity. People are primarily motivated by their desire to improve their own lives and circumstances, disregarding the well-being of those below them in the social hierarchy. This is exemplified through the character of the factory owners and managers. Their sole focus is on expanding their businesses and increasing their wealth, disregarding the harm caused to the environment and the people who suffer as a result. Sinclair uses descriptive language, such as the image of factory chimneys releasing smoke into the air, to illustrate the detrimental impact of their actions. The owners and managers show a blatant disregard for their employees, treating them as nothing more than a means to an end. They prioritize profits over people, forcing their workers to toil in hazardous conditions and terminate them without warning or compensation. The era in which the novel is set lacked regulations to protect workers' rights, allowing the factory owners to exploit their employees. The working-class people in Packingtown were essentially trapped, with no access to resources or support to help them escape their plight. The absence of effective aid and the prevalence of corrupt unions only exacerbated their struggles, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation. The novel describes the workers as being in a state of servitude, highlighting the inevitability and prevalence of immorality in such a system.",
            "Several authors employ various techniques to evoke a particular emotion or perspective in their readers. Some methods are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald exemplifies this by utilizing various techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. One of these techniques involves pairing an adjective with an unrelated noun to create a distinct atmosphere around a subject. Alternatively, he assigns significance to a symbol and later uses it to convey a particular feeling. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald uses this technique with colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink, giving them specific meanings. By doing so, he creates an association between these colors and a particular atmosphere in the novel.\n\nFitzgerald develops and applies the meaning of white/gray, which represents uniformity. He portrays white as representing refinement and high social status, while gray signifies age and dullness. At the beginning of the novel, Fitzgerald frequently uses both colors to establish this meaning. For instance, Daisy and Jordan are often depicted wearing white, and this is not unique to them; Nick also wears white flannels to Gatsby's party, while Tom wears a white shirt when meeting Myrtle. The only time white is absent is when Nick describes his initial impressions of Gatsby's party, where the halls are painted with primary colors. Fitzgerald further reinforces these colors by applying them to ordinary, insignificant subjects, such as the white chasms of lower New York and gray names on Nick's schedule. He also uses white and gray to describe common, unremarkable people or places, like the \"white girlhood\" Daisy and Jordan shared, the \"gray cars and gray land\" in the valley of ashes, and the \"gray old man\" selling dogs. After establishing the meaning of white and gray, Fitzgerald employs them to signify the lack of significance or uniformity of certain subjects.\n\nFitzgerald initially introduces the technique of using colors to convey meaning when describing Daisy. After a period with minimal use of the colors, he reappears with Daisy wearing a white dress, which reduces her character to a uniform, unremarkable entity that Gatsby desires. This technique is further utilized by Fitzgerald to portray Daisy in a more uniform and unremarkable light. For example, her fur collar is described as a \"gray haze,\" and she is again dressed in white before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "The San Diego County region is notable for its high agricultural productivity, largely due to its pleasant climate and abundant sunlight. Farmers in the area cultivate a diverse range of crops, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. A significant demand exists for locally sourced, organic produce, resulting in long waiting lists for community-supported agriculture programs. Organic dairy products, such as eggs and milk, are also in high demand. Many organic farms in the area offer guided tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for outdoor activities like hiking and birdwatching. This type of agricultural operation allows landowners to take advantage of government incentives while promoting habitat conservation, enabling recreational use, and creating opportunities for educational programs and tours.\n\nIn addition to catering to a lucrative niche market, organic farming often brings about increased biodiversity in the surrounding area due to the absence of chemical pesticides and fertilizers in the soil and water. However, organic farming can be more labor-intensive and costly compared to conventional farming methods. It requires more hands-on care to manage pests, weeds, and soil quality without using chemicals, leading to potentially higher losses. Small-scale organic farms also face efficiency challenges due to their limited size compared to larger operations. Furthermore, implementing beneficial non-organic practices, such as planting cover crops, controlling invasive species, and managing plant growth, can incur additional labor costs.\n\nConsidering these factors, a landowner in this scenario may seek financial assistance or expert guidance to maximize both profits and environmental quality. The chosen land, located near the town of Potrero in San Diego County, California, comprises 160 acres of chaparral, non-native grasslands, and oak woodlands adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This area is situated within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently evaluates over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered or threatened, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and several butterfly species.\n\nHistorically, this land was inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood traders in the late 19th century. The property was part of a homestead patent and likely used for grazing and wood harvesting for many years. To explore available government programs and their potential benefits for small farmers, I selected a piece of land from a real estate website and researched relevant options. For the purpose of this example, I examined an organic farm in the same area to illustrate a realistic approach to balancing economic viability with wildlife conservation.",
            "Negotiations are heavily influenced by the cultural context in which they take place. Culture can be defined as much by its nuances as by its explicit characteristics. It is not a uniform or monolithic entity, but rather a complex tapestry of various aspects. Generalizations, such as assuming all members of a particular culture share the same traits, are overly simplistic and inaccurate. To be effective in negotiations, it is more productive to understand how a culture's values and attitudes relate to the specific issue at hand and how they may impact the negotiation process. When interacting with a foreign culture, individuals often draw comparisons to their own culture, leading to a more relatable understanding.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset can involve exploring its history, traditions, and biases. Rather than judging or trying to alter a culture, it is essential to accept it for what it is and work within its boundaries, particularly in negotiations. When in a weaker bargaining position, respecting traditions and beliefs can help bridge cultural divides and facilitate progress in negotiations. The cultural landscape is not limited to a national or international divide; corporate cultures can be just as distinct, with variations in work-life balance, communication styles, and values. For instance, a company may prioritize long work hours or a more relaxed atmosphere, and these differences can be seen in employee dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. \n\nIt is vital to consider the underlying values that shape a culture, as they provide the foundation for its behavior. In cultures where preserving face or communal harmony is crucial, a negotiator would be unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superior to achieve success at the negotiation table. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that values a hard-driving approach may be less inclined to settle for the first available option. Taking these cultural nuances into account before the negotiation can significantly improve the outcome. Nevertheless, it is also essential for a negotiator to gain a personal understanding of their opponent to achieve effective results.",
            "The statement \"There is no God\" is attributed to the fool in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and it forms the foundation of St. Anselm's argument for the existence of God. Similarly, Thomas Aquinas defends the same concept, making it essential to consider both their arguments side by side. Given that our objective is to compare their reasoning, we will assume that both thinkers believe in the God of the Bible, as a hypothetical God-like figure could dilute the comparison since their arguments are specifically tailored to this particular concept. Although both authors present valid points, we argue that neither provides a comprehensive basis for believing in God.\n\nTo illustrate this point, let's examine the core idea of St. Anselm's argument. Anselm suggests a path to understanding God through introspection, contending that the existence of God can be deduced from within one's own mind. According to Anselm, since we cannot imagine a God's nonexistence, it implies that God's existence is inherent in our understanding. This concept, while articulated in Anselm's own terminology, essentially proposes that the truth about God is accessible through self-reflection, without requiring external evidence. This perspective is closely tied to the Christian concept of faith, which often involves accepting truths without definitive empirical proof.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas presents a different perspective, advocating that the existence of God can be proven solely through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith. This approach would be advantageous in evangelism, as it would enable the conversion of new followers without relying on their willingness to accept unproven claims. Aquinas outlines five logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. By demonstrating the logical necessity of God's existence, Aquinas argues that we can infer the existence of God without needing to see direct evidence.",
            "Around 2,500 years ago, a prince who would eventually be known as the Buddha was born, marking the beginning of a spiritual journey that would eventually lead to the establishment of Buddhism. Over the course of his life, he abandoned worldly life and achieved enlightenment, leaving behind a legacy of teachings that have undergone significant transformations over time. This evolution is evident in countries like Sri Lanka, where the Theravada nation celebrates the annual water-cutting ceremony, which has no basis in the Buddha's original teachings. The differences between the original teachings and the current practices are so profound that they span from superficial traditions to the fundamental principles of the religion. As a result, the Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt its core beliefs, influenced by both internal and external factors, ranging from friendly to hostile.\n\nTo better understand this discussion, it is essential to note the distinction between internal and external forces. Internal forces refer to changes driven by the Buddhist community itself, regardless of their monastic status, while external forces originate from non-Buddhists. Additionally, hostile forces aim to harm or damage the Buddhist community, whereas benign forces neither intend to harm nor help the community, although their actions might have unintended consequences.\n\nThis analysis begins by examining the fundamental principles of Theravada Buddhism. At its core, Buddhists seek refuge in the Triple Gem, consisting of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma encompasses the Tripitaka, a collection of three baskets of sacred texts, including the Sutta Pitaka, which contains sermons, the Vinaya Pitaka, which outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, which delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These metaphysical concepts, such as Anatta (the absence of a permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (the impermanence of all things), are the keys to escaping Sansara, the cycle of rebirth and death, and ultimately achieving liberation from lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). In the Vinaya Pitaka, guidelines for laypeople and monks are outlined, including the five precepts for laymen and a more extensive set of rules for monks. The most fundamental principles of Buddhism revolve around the four noble truths: Dukkha (the truth of suffering), the cause of suffering (attachment), and the possibility of overcoming suffering.",
            "A notable example of a long-standing rivalry between two nations is the relationship between the United States and Mexico, which endured for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. This animosity reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the U.S. successfully defeated Mexico, gaining control of Texas and the American Southwest. The rivalry between the two nations was marked by various conflicts, which gradually subsided before the onset of World War I. Initially, the disagreement stemmed from fundamental differences in religion, culture, and tradition, as well as competing material interests. \n\nThis scenario is reminiscent of numerous other nations that share a border, often leading to clashes of interests and the formation of rival positions. The U.S. and Mexico's relationship is similar to other long-standing rivalries between neighboring countries. David M. Pletcher notes that Mexico and Cuba are the only two nations with long-standing issues in their diplomatic relations with the U.S. (Pletcher 1977, p. 41). Given their geographical proximity to the U.S., these countries have historically been its rivals, whereas other Latin American nations have generally enjoyed good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences created a significant divide between the two nations, a common issue that has affected many countries throughout history. According to Sally Frahm, Americans have historically opposed Catholicism and monarchy, mirroring their opposition to fascism and communism in the 20th century (Frahm 2001, p. 86). This rivalry, like the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, was partly driven by ideological differences and partly by competition over vital interests. However, in this case, the ideological struggles revolved around the two nations' differing religious preferences, inherited from their former colonial rulers and contributing to their distrust of each other. This legacy of distrust posed a significant obstacle to establishing friendly relations between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 disputes between Mexico and the U.S. during the 57-year period of rivalry. Most of these disputes concerned territorial issues, such as cross-border raids and frontier problems. The issue of border raids by outlaws and bandits from American border towns was a persistent problem that was eventually addressed through joint military efforts by both countries (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry between the two nations began to dissipate as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the U.S. and American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (Schmitt 1974, p. 110). This marked the beginning of the end of the long-standing rivalry between the two nations in the late 19th century.",
            "It has been fifteen years since an unexpected illness left me disabled, erasing my identity as a nurse, a profession I had chosen as a means of achieving stability. I was driven by a deep-seated desire for security, which was a result of my tumultuous childhood. The notion that I would always be able to find employment, as people would always require medical care, resonated with me, and so I pursued nursing despite my true aspirations to be a scientist or journalist. However, life had other plans, and at 46, I found myself penniless and unable to work. Fifteen years of living on disability benefits have left me with nothing to call my own, and every day is a struggle to maintain my sense of security and self-worth. \n\nIt's a harsh reality that even the strongest individuals need help during times of crisis, and I owe my survival to the unwavering support of my family and close friends. The truth is, we are not invincible, and even the most resilient people crumble when faced with real adversity. \n\nMy point is that life is unpredictable, and no matter how well-prepared we think we are, there will always be challenges that surpass our capabilities. The notion that we should rely solely on our own abilities to overcome difficulties is misguided. In the United States, I believe it's time to shift our focus from solely relying on the government to a more community-driven approach, where individuals learn to trust and support one another. This mindset is rooted in the country's history, as our forefathers thrived during difficult times not through rugged individualism, but through compassion, mutual respect, and resource sharing. The pioneers who traversed the American West in wagon trains did not achieve their goals alone; they relied on each other for support.\n\nWhile it's essential to be prepared for emergencies, having a disaster kit, first aid supplies, and other essentials is not a substitute for building strong relationships with those around us. I advocate for a balanced approach that combines preparedness with a sense of community and mutual aid. If feasible, investing in a small farm, a wood stove, or other self-sufficiency measures can be beneficial, but it's equally crucial to foster connections with your neighbors and be willing to ask for help when needed.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in a particular way remains a complex and unanswered one. Despite the efforts of scientists like D'Arcy Thompson, who made groundbreaking statements on the subject in 1917, there is still a long way to go in defining the intricate patterns of organic forms. Recent studies have applied mathematical modeling to better understand the development of shells in mollusks, a field pioneered by researchers such as Raup and Stanley in 1981. Our research is focused on using mathematical models of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in the species Prunum in conjunction with experimental studies to uncover the underlying mechanisms that guide the direction and magnitude of evolutionary change. By analyzing X-ray images of Prunum species, we have identified quantitative parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters were inputted into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995) to simulate various shell shapes and sizes.\n\nA shell can be envisioned as a cylindrical structure that progresses through 360 degrees of space over time. Each complete rotation of the shell is referred to as a whorl, which spirals around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which the whorls expand can vary, and a continuous line separating each whorl is called a suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the final one, known as the body whorl. The central part of the shell, excluding the last whorl, is referred to as the spire. The spire's tip is the apex, while the opposite end is the base. The shell's opening, through which the animal emerges, is called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various perspectives, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. In standard orientation, the shell is viewed from the apertural perspective, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count the number of whorls, an observer must first view the shell from the apical perspective and identify the starting point of the first suture. A line is then drawn to divide the shell into two parts, and the whorls are counted from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of openings that move through time and space as the animal builds its shell. By tracking the path of the aperture using the coordinates of the center of each whorl's opening and its horizontal and vertical radius, it is possible to graphically and mathematically represent the shell's development. Once a mathematical model is established, it can be modified by varying parameters to alter the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained largely unchanged over the past decade.  Despite Indonesia being on track to meet several Millennium Development Goals, such as its targets for water and sanitation, the country is struggling to make sufficient progress in improving child and maternal health. The impending deadline of 2015 for achieving these goals is now looming, and the underlying reasons for this stagnation will be explored below. These reasons highlight the need to revamp the overall healthcare system rather than focusing solely on specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has made some advancements in the number of births attended by skilled healthcare professionals, with 72% now meeting this benchmark. However, this statistic includes traditional workers like midwives, who may not have the necessary medical expertise to handle complicated pregnancies, contributing to the significant number of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhaging. Consequently, the progress in this area is somewhat misleading, and more work remains to be done. Furthermore, there has been a decline in the proportion of children under five treated by a healthcare professional for diarrheal cases, and the data on postnatal care is incomplete, revealing a pressing concern that warrants attention.\n\nThe rate of cesarean sections is still lower than expected, standing at around 4%. This figure also underscores a more pressing issue, as the rate of cesarean sections in urban settings is significantly higher (7%) compared to rural areas (2%). This disparity highlights the unequal distribution of healthcare services, with access largely concentrated in urban areas. Another issue is the vertical inequity in healthcare access, where there is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the underprivileged face significant barriers in accessing healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nWhen considering the next steps towards enhancing neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is how to effectively address the shortage of healthcare services. Specifically, Indonesia should decide whether to develop targeted program-specific approaches or strengthen its overall healthcare system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children. While programmatic approaches may be attractive, offering targeted, manageable objectives and faster results, they also have some drawbacks. One significant disadvantage is that investing heavily in a particular area of the health sector can divert resources away from other essential areas, causing a shortage of human resources in those areas. Another issue is the duplication and lack of coordination between programs, resulting in excessive paperwork and administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian novels are characterized by their meticulous descriptions and a focus on the upper class of the time period. However, two novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, diverge from this tradition by incorporating elements of mystery and the unconventional. These novels use these mysterious elements to provide insight into their characters' motivations and emotions, making them more complex and believable. \n\nCharles Dickens' writing in Oliver Twist exemplifies this use of mystery through dream sequences and dreamlike states. In this novel, these strange events often reveal Oliver's inner turmoil, the sources of his pain, and his growing awareness of the harsh realities surrounding him. For instance, when Oliver is shot in chapter 28, he vividly relives the event, still reeling from the trauma. The passage highlights Oliver's lack of control over the situation, as well as the dire state of his health, which is vividly portrayed through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, and his senses become numb as he is carried away by an unseen force. This experience is a powerful portrayal of Oliver's helplessness, as he is unable to influence the outcome of the event, even when his life is at risk. This reinforces the notion that Oliver lacks agency, and a growing sense of defeat is implied, as if Fagin's influence has broken him, leading to a state of despair. It can be inferred that Oliver would have taken action to save himself if he had not been so consumed by hopelessness. \n\nSimilarly, in the same novel, Dickens uses another passage to convey the sense of time distortion and despair that Oliver experiences: \"The day passed off quickly – in fact, it was over before it had begun – and night came on again, a long and dreadful night that seemed to last forever, yet was fleeting and short-lived.\"",
            "It's been a while since I was involved in an after-school tutoring program for elementary school students. My main focus was helping them with any subject they were struggling with, but my strengths lay in English and reading. I was approached by one of the instructors to work with a boy named Adrian, who was having significant trouble with reading. Initially, it seemed like he had a peculiar issue, as some letters he could pronounce correctly, while others were completely off. Adrian's background was Latino, but he spoke fluent English. We continued to work together until I met his mother, who only spoke Spanish. Despite my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate. It was then that I realized Adrian's reading struggles were not due to his ability to read, but rather his unfamiliarity with the English alphabet. I'm not sure if this insight helped him much, but I hope he's made progress since then.\n\nI share this story to highlight the challenge of language barriers in schools, particularly in California. It's clear that this is a widespread issue, even among students who speak English fluently. It can be a significant obstacle for them, and it's essential that we find a solution. In Adrian's case, the solution was straightforward: targeted English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children who barely speak English, the solution is more complex. There is no one-size-fits-all answer, and it requires a combination of various approaches. These might include dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, or a combination of these. The key is to integrate multiple strategies.\n\nThe dual language system is an excellent concept, not just for students whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Research has shown that students in two-way bilingual education programs tend to outperform their peers academically. Many people fear that implementing such programs will be a waste of resources and only benefit a minority of students. However, this is a misconception. If we made dual language programs the norm, rather than the exception, all students would benefit from them. The challenge lies in implementing this, such as providing bilingual support staff, including tutors, aides, or other specialists, to assist teachers in the classroom. While it may be unrealistic to require all teachers to be bilingual, having bilingual support staff can make a significant difference.",
            "From a young age, many of us are first introduced to the idea that there exists something greater than ourselves, something that transcends our understanding.  We may receive instruction in this concept through various channels, such as attending Sunday school, visiting a temple, or exploring our own inner selves.  While some people readily accept the spiritual traditions passed down to them by their parents, others reject them outright, convinced that there is no truth beyond their own perception.  As we navigate life, we often question and reassess our values and beliefs, adopting new perspectives and spiritual paths that resonate with us.  In our search for meaning and purpose, we seek guidance to lead us out of darkness and into the light.\n\nIn a moment of introspection, my father shared with me his favorite type of bird, the cardinal, as we sat together on the porch, listening to the rain pour down on the tin roof.  His distant gaze into the rain suggested a mix of contemplation and reminiscence.  His frail appearance, accentuated by the loss of weight and a receding hairline, made me feel a sense of isolation and fear.  I avoided discussing my sadness about his impending loss, aware that acknowledging it would make it harder for both of us to cope.  I instinctively drew closer to him, and we sat together in silence, watching the rain during the twilight of June.\n\nMy father passed away in December, just five days after my 22nd birthday.  Despite the chemotherapy and radiation, he had lived a few months longer than the doctors had predicted, but his suffering only prolonged the agony.  I wondered if a higher power could have done something to ease his pain.  During that difficult night, I did not pray, questioning the existence of a God who seemed to have abandoned me. \n\nI had not wanted to witness my father's departure from this life, and so I chose not to be present.  I did not want to remember him by how he died but by how he lived.  I knew my father better than anyone else, and I believed he would not have wanted me to be a bystander at his death.  I spent three days in a state of emotional numbness, waiting for the news, but no one reached out to me.",
            "The Gothic novel is a contradictory concept, as Ian Watt describes it, combining the ideas of 'old' and 'new' in a single entity. The genre has received both criticism and praise, with some viewing it as lacking depth and others appreciating its ability to evoke a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). When Horace Walpole created the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, he drew upon the elements of both ancient and modern romances to create a new form of literary expression. By merging \"old\" theatrical characteristics with the \"new\" style of modern novels, Walpole coined the term \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre frequently incorporates elements from medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. At the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication, the term \"Gothic\" was used to describe various people, styles, and time periods, often with a negative connotation, implying a lack of sophistication compared to \"modern\" societal and literary advancements. The combination of the dramatic \"Gothic\" style with the novel's innovative format, which allows readers to directly experience the characters' psychology, has enabled the Gothic genre to remain relevant for a long time and to be perceived as both outdated and novel to readers separated from the original writing by time.\n\nOne of the key ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of chivalry. The medieval notion of chivalry, which emphasizes the development of a proper knight, is reinterpreted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry holds significance for Gothic writers due to its representation of the ideal knight: brave, honorable, and capable. Writers, particularly Walpole, were drawn to this ideal because they perceived a lack of it in their contemporary society. By incorporating chivalric concepts and values, the \"gothic past\" is romanticized and idealized, foreshadowing the evolution of Gothic into Romanticism, and used as a means to critique the present. Walpole, who wrote The Castle of Otranto during a tumultuous period in his life, amid political turmoil and unfair accusations, may have subconsciously felt that the perceived goodness and morality of the gothic era had been lost in his contemporaries. This sentiment is evident in the character of Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, such as being described as a prince who has suffered and is said to have been wronged by infidels. This portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is an exaggerated representation, introducing the tropes of excess that would become characteristic of the Gothic genre (66).",
            "Supply chain management encompasses a wide array of processes involved in getting goods from the initial customer order to the final delivery to the customer. The term was coined by Keith Oliver in 1982, a consultant who described the comprehensive process of planning, implementing, and controlling supply chain activities to meet customer needs efficiently and quickly. Effective supply chain management relies on six crucial elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers leverage these elements to deliver exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction is the foundation of the supply chain process, laying the groundwork for the entire sequence of events. To initiate production, managers must understand customer preferences, which can be gauged by analyzing market trends. By doing so, they can determine the products in demand, decide on production quantities, and select the optimal production location and facility to meet customer expectations for volume and quality. Every aspect of production, from scheduling workloads to equipment maintenance, is critical to the process's success. Inadequate planning can lead to wasted time and resources, as exemplified by large retailers like Wal-Mart and Target, which establish detailed processes and protocols for each aspect of their business.\n\nSupply is the second vital component of supply chain management, encompassing strategic decisions regarding a company's core capabilities and partnerships. This involves assessing the optimal distribution of production processes among various divisions, each with its own equipment, workforce, and specializations. Managers may choose to outsource certain tasks to other companies to enhance velocity – the ability to deliver high-quality products while maintaining low costs or reducing costs further. By making informed decisions about supply, companies can streamline their operations and better meet customer demands.",
            "Ellen Page, known for her role in the film Juno, holds a cardboard sign with an unsettling message in Burma, a country in Southeast Asia ruled by a ruthless military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup. The sign reads \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" In 2007, a series of protests broke out in the country, led by Burmese monks who wore saffron robes. These protests, known as the Saffron Revolution, initially sparked public interest and were allowed by the government. However, the situation soon escalated into violence, with the military invading and looting monasteries and foreign journalists being arrested and imprisoned. A Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed in September 2007 for covering the protests. While the official death toll is 13, Colonel Hla Win, a defected army colonel, claimed that the actual number of fatalities is much higher.\n\nThis phenomenon is not new. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain control over their populations. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine authority, while Japanese emperors were believed to be gods. Even in modern times, some leaders have engaged in similar behavior. For instance, the Chinese government responded to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests with a violent crackdown, resulting in a disputed death toll ranging from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide in the 1990s, carried out by Hutu militia groups and the Rwandan government, another example of systematic violence against a particular group. The Holocaust, led by Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, is another extreme example of government-sanctioned violence against a specific ethnicity.",
            "The enduring legacy of Duke Ellington in the realm of jazz is a direct result of his remarkable longevity and creative versatility. Although his piano presence may be subtle in many compositions, as a master composer, Ellington excelled at crafting intricate pieces that showcased the unique talents of each band member. By skillfully designing the framework for improvisation and writing tightly orchestrated passages that highlighted individual band styles, Ellington successfully created a cohesive and original sound for each piece. His deep understanding of the distinct sounds of his players and how they blended together to form a cohesive ensemble enabled him to compose some of the most innovative and groundbreaking pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative approach to music by mentioning Creole Love Call, which exemplifies his use of voice as a versatile instrument throughout his career. This early piece showcases his ability to incorporate voice as a sonic element without being bound by lyrics, adding texture and depth to his music. The structure of Creole Love Call, a slow twelve-bar blues piece with six distinct choruses, is a testament to Ellington's skill in complementing the unique styles of his soloists. The six choruses of Creole Love Call feature a range of musical elements, including a call-and-response pattern, a muted trumpet solo, a sweeping clarinet solo, and a climactic reed section.\n\nEllington's use of voice in Creole Love Call is just one example of his ability to introduce new dimensions of tone color to his music. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington demonstrates his mastery of orchestration and his ear for tone color by combining a call-and-response phrase between a muted trumpet and scat singing. This approach to music is further refined in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Ellington skillfully utilizes the unique sound of Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone to introduce the melody, creating a rich and complementary sound.",
            "She had always felt a persistent sense of longing, a desire that remained unfulfilled. This feeling started to manifest at the age of 14, as she began to navigate the challenges of adolescence. Three years later, at 17, she had come to realize that her desire wasn't for material possessions, but for a deeper connection with someone. However, she found herself disinterested in the boys around her, and despite some suitors' efforts to win her over, none of them truly resonated with her. She often struggled to understand the root of her feelings, and as the years went by, she considered various theories, but none seemed convincing enough to explain her situation. As a result, she continued to live life, grappling with her desires.\n\nLife at home was typically peaceful, thanks to her parents' calm demeanor. They rarely argued with each other, and even their conversations with her were infrequent. The only disagreements they had were about her strong sense of independence and free-spirited nature, which often contrasted with their more laid-back personalities. Her parents' even-tempered approach to life was an interesting contrast to her own lively personality, which made her all the more endearing to those around her.\n\nHowever, today was not a typical day. As she wandered from room to room, searching for inspiration, she heard a faint cry from the kitchen, followed by the sound of her mother's distressed voice. Rushing into the room, she grew anxious and frantically asked, \"Mom, what's wrong?!\" Upon seeing her mother lying on the ground, clutching her side in pain, she rushed to her side and tried to assist her. \"Ouch... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother managed to stammer between ragged breaths. Recognizing her mother's intense pain, she quickly offered to help, asking, \"Okay, Mom, where can you pick you up?\" Her mother pointed her in the right direction, and at that moment, her daughter felt grateful for the self-defense classes she had taken, which allowed her to lift and support her mother. She carefully placed her mother in the car and drove her to the hospital.\n\nUpon arriving at the hospital, the strong scent of disinfectant and the atmosphere of anxiety filled the air, but her daughter's focus remained on supporting her mother. She quickly brought her mother to the examination area and signaled for medical help. As the doctors and nurses gathered around, they quickly assessed her mother's condition and transferred her to a rolling bed. Her daughter was left to sit and worry, anxiously waiting for news about her mother's condition.\n\nIt turned out that her mother had slipped off a step stool while reaching for a vase on a high cabinet.",
            "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether adhering to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet) is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease and stroke, as well as stroke mortality. The study focused on a modified version of the Med diet, known as the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet,\" which emphasizes consuming more plant-based foods, including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, along with higher intakes of monounsaturated fats and fish, while minimizing animal products and saturated fats. The study also allowed for moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious studies had shown that adherence to a Med diet is associated with a lower risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, and that it is more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving cholesterol levels in obese individuals. However, previous research had not specifically examined the relationship between the Med diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study, which was part of the Nurses' Health Study, a large cohort study of female nurses in the US, followed 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 years without a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes. The researchers calculated an aMed diet score based on self-reported food frequency questionnaires completed six times between 1984 and 2004. The high participation rate of over 95% throughout the 20-year study period ensured the reliability of the data. The questionnaires were validated through medical records, autopsy, and death certificates, with cases of heart disease and stroke confirmed through review of these documents. Additional factors such as body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, and menopausal status were also accounted for.\n\nTo account for individual variations in dietary habits and better represent long-term dietary intake, the researchers calculated the cumulative average of the aMed score from the repeated questionnaires. They adjusted for potential confounding factors, including age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the study found that a higher aMed diet score was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke in women. Over a 20-year follow-up period, the researchers identified 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women with the highest aMed diet score had a lower risk of both heart disease and stroke compared to those with the lowest score, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "In 2007, the United States faced an severe economic downturn caused by a financial crisis that has persisted to this day. The aftermath of the crisis saw rising unemployment and a collapsed housing market, resulting in the downfall of numerous major corporations. In order to understand and prevent such events from recurring, it is essential to investigate the causes behind the crisis. Essentially, the crisis was triggered by reckless and ill-advised governmental decisions that forced banks and financial institutions to issue high-risk sub-prime loans to an already fragile financial structure. Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were compelled to purchase and repackage these sub-prime mortgages into complex financial instruments, such as CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks faced significant financial shortfalls, which were subsequently transferred to the repackaged mortgages and the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis date back to the late 1990s, during President Clinton's administration. In an attempt to secure re-election, the Clinton administration relaxed lending regulations, paving the way for the subsequent sub-prime crisis. As reported by Steven Holmes of the New York Times in 1999, Fannie Mae was under pressure from the government to increase mortgage lending to low-income households, while also facing pressure from shareholders to maintain its rapid growth in profits. Holmes' insightful commentary predicted that the government-backed corporation might encounter difficulties in case of an economic downturn, necessitating a government bailout akin to the one for the savings and loan industry in the 1980s. Unfortunately, his warning turned out to be prophetic, as the economy eventually experienced a catastrophic meltdown.\n\nA combination of factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the emergence of novel and complex mortgage products, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). The extensive use of these products led to increased interconnectedness of various sectors of the economy with the housing market, causing households and financial markets to become heavily leveraged and vulnerable to even minor price fluctuations. As a result, the housing bubble eventually burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities facing significant losses.\n\nThe extent of the crisis became apparent in 2007, when the top five U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, accounting for approximately 30% of the country's GDP. The crisis led to the collapse of Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch, while Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to transform into commercial banks subject to stringent regulations. Fannie and Freddie, burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "The infamous exposition - that part of the story where writers often struggle to strike the right balance between revealing essential information and overwhelming their readers. While it's meant to be an opportunity for creative expression, it can just as easily lead to eye-glazing passages that leave readers yawning or, worse still, hitting the \"Back\" button in frustration. Even seasoned writers like Dr. Merlin have been guilty of succumbing to the temptation of lengthy exposition, often with less-than-ideal results.\n\nExposition is a common pitfall that many writers face, despite being familiar with the fundamental principle, \"Show, don't tell.\" It's the internal voice that whispers to get necessary details out of the way, often disguising itself as efficiency. However, this \"devil on the shoulder\" can lead to dry, information-heavy passages that fail to engage readers.\n\nTo illustrate this point, consider a narrative where the author tells the reader about a character's entire history, including their meeting with their partner, their wedding, and the partner's tragic demise, all within a few lines of dialogue. This approach would likely fall flat, leaving the reader uninvested in the character's fate and lacking insight into their emotional depth. A more effective approach would be to gradually reveal the character's personality, background, and relationships through subtle actions, speech, and interactions, allowing the reader to form a genuine connection.\n\nFor instance, instead of being told that a character's husband loved them deeply, the reader should experience it through his words, mannerisms, and the heroine's reactions to him. This nuanced portrayal would make his eventual death more impactful and allow the reader to empathize with the heroine's emotional journey. By providing more depth to the story's surface-level narrative, writers can craft a richer, more engaging experience for their readers.\n\nAs a writer, it's essential to resist the temptation to rush through exposition, especially when introducing new characters or plot points. Even seemingly minor details, such as a character's past experiences or motivations, can be presented in a way that feels organic and engaging, rather than info-dumping. By doing so, writers can create a more immersive and memorable story that draws readers in and refuses to let go.",
            "I watched live news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, on August 13, 2011. The first newscast I viewed was from NBC 4 in the morning. The leading story reported on a shocking incident in Ashley, Ohio, where a man named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife, although her name was not revealed. The news segment showed his mug shot, and he appeared to exude an eerie aura. The story was covered for approximately two minutes as it was still developing. Given the circumstances, it seemed like an adequate amount of time was devoted to this story.\n\nThe second story concerned an early morning shooting in the Sharon Woods area, in which an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers was critically injured but no arrests had been made at the time. The SWAT team was investigating. This story seemed brief, and I suspect it might have been due to the fact that the victim was a minority and the incident occurred in a predominantly minority neighborhood. My observation over the years has been that minority victims of crime often receive less media attention compared to those from the majority group. \n\nThe next story reported on a gunshot hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were provided about the suspected location of the incident, and it was determined that a .22 caliber rifle bullet had struck the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers was offering a substantial reward for any information leading to the identification of the shooter.\n\nThe following story was about the impending rain and thunderstorms forecasted for Saturday afternoon. They predicted temperatures to remain in the mid-to-low eighties for the weekend. The segment was a bit concise, possibly intended to pique viewers' interest and encourage them to stay tuned.\n\nAdditionally, the news aired a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. According to reports, a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt robbed the store, described as being around six feet tall and weighing approximately 150 pounds. I found it peculiar that they gave an unusual amount of emphasis on his skin color and darkness.\n\nThe final story I viewed was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin, who had been found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. It was noted that he received a 300-month prison sentence instead of stating it as 25 years. I'm unsure if this phrasing was intended to convey a harsher punishment or simply to highlight the duration. The news also identified Rodriguez as a Hispanic man, but I don't believe this detail was pertinent to the story.",
            "There exists a profound bond between brothers, an unbreakable and irreversible connection that encompasses a wide range of complex emotions such as love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers possess a deep understanding of one another that surpasses their relationships with anyone else, often seeing themselves reflected in their sibling. In times of crisis, the true essence of this bond is revealed, whether it is characterized by positivity or negativity. The consequences of these emotions can be far-reaching and often come at a great cost. To comprehend the emotions stemming from this fraternal connection, one must also consider the repercussions that accompany them. When an individual can look into their brother's eyes and see their own reflection, they gain insight into their true character, which is often revealed through their actions and the outcomes of those actions. The novel \"The Scarlet Ibis\" explores this theme through the tumultuous relationship between two brothers, their intense emotions, and the vivid description of their surroundings. \n\nThe protagonist's actions are primarily driven by one dominating emotion: pride. From their initial journey together to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist harbors resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle. The protagonist had envisioned a brother who could participate in various activities and share in his experiences, such as exploring the outdoors and engaging in physical activities. However, Doodle's congenital heart condition made it highly unlikely that he would be able to participate in these activities, shattering the protagonist's dreams. The protagonist even harbors anger towards Doodle, as evidenced by his thoughts of harming him. Nevertheless, the child's smile brings out a deep-seated love within the protagonist, indicating that his feelings for his brother were not as superficial as they initially seemed. This internal conflict highlights the complexities of the bond between brothers and the various emotions that arise from it.",
            "The human brain is an intricate and innovative processing system that handles vast amounts of information. Over time, as technology has evolved, so have the metaphors used to describe the brain. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. It's essential to remember that these metaphors are limited and may lead to misconceptions when trying to understand the brain's workings.\n\nThe processing of information begins with sensory organs transforming physical stimuli, such as touch, temperature, sound waves, or light, into electrochemical signals. These sensory inputs are then repeatedly processed by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing methods. For instance, when viewing a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles basic information like color, orientation, and border details to identify the object as a box. Top-down processing, on the other hand, uses previously made decisions to expedite recognition of the object, potentially identifying it as a black box rather than a hole in the background.\n\nOnce the processing reaches a certain level, an attention filter determines the signal's importance and allocates it to the relevant cognitive processes. Although the brain processes every detail when looking at the grass near your shoes, a healthy filter prevents you from consciously perceiving each blade individually. Conversely, you might focus on your name even when spoken in a noisy environment. This cycle of processing and filtering occurs repeatedly and involves multiple stages.\n\nBefore the brain can process information, it must first store it. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, and the method of encoding varies depending on the type of sensory stimulus. For example, verbal input can be encoded according to its visual appearance, its sound, or its meaning. Once stored, information needs to be maintained. Research on animals suggests that working memory, which retains information for about 20 seconds, is sustained through temporary electrical signals passed through specific neurons. Long-term memory is believed to be sustained through the structure of particular types of proteins.\n\nThere are numerous theories on how knowledge is organized within the brain, each based on different approaches such as memory recall, computer science, or neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that there are nodes representing concepts and that these nodes are connected based on their relevance. For instance, in a semantic network, the concept of a \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the looming threats of technology and capitalism in his dystopian novel Brave New World, where individuals prioritize the collective over the individual and are conditioned to crave instant gratification above all else. The citizens are portrayed as mere pawns in a larger game, conditioned to conform to a single ideology dictated by the all-powerful World Controller. Analyzing the work through a Marxist lens reveals Huxley's underlying concerns about the development of these systems. The novel's use of Marxist terminology, such as homogenization and reification, reinforces the idea that Huxley is cautioning against the flaws in the emerging economic systems of his time.\n\nThe novel satirizes capitalism by employing the concept of false consciousness, which suggests that the common masses are unaware of their true relationships with other economic classes due to ideological control. The lower classes, like the Deltas and Gammas, are conditioned to prioritize consumption, spending, and indulgence through hypnopædia, while the upper classes, such as the Alphas and Betas, are born with the privilege of awareness but often fail to challenge the status quo. The novel portrays a society where the lower classes are oblivious to their manipulation, perpetuating a system that serves the interests of the ruling elite. The interactions between individuals in Brave New World are superficial, lacking depth and genuine connections, suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism stifles human free will and emotional expression. The characters' complacency with their assigned roles in the hierarchy and their absolute obedience to the community reflect Marxist ideas about the exploited proletariat, who are led to believe in their own superiority as long as they conform to the norms of consumerism and obedience.\n\nRelationships between individuals are nonexistent in Brave New World, and the novel's portrayal of interactions highlights the dehumanizing effects of capitalism. The characters' limited emotional ranges and shallow conversations, often focused on physical appearances, illustrate the ways in which capitalism reduces individuals to mere commodities. The novel's depiction of a society where people are willing to conform to their predetermined roles and accept their place in the hierarchy is a commentary on the oppressive nature of capitalism and the ways in which it erodes human consciousness and relationships.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for approximately two and a half years, which is equivalent to four and a half semesters. For many of my peers and myself, navigating the campus is often a challenge. During my freshman year, I was accommodated in an East Halls dorm, situated near the eastern edge of the campus, excluding the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. The distance between my home in Stuart Hall and my classes in the Willard building, which is centrally located, could take up to 25 minutes to cover on foot, especially during inclement weather, which is common in State College. Upon conversing with an alumnus roughly my age, I discovered that the East Halls dorms were previously isolated from the rest of the campus by vast empty spaces. However, these areas have since been transformed into sports facilities, state-of-the-art buildings such as the new Creamery and health services building, and surrounded by apartments. As the campus continues to expand, the issue of mobility becomes increasingly pressing. In this context, the most effective solution is undoubtedly cycling. Nonetheless, owning a bike is not enough; students need to actively use them, and the campus infrastructure must be designed with the needs of cyclists in mind.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who had resumed cycling after a several-year break. He expressed his surprise at why he had ever stopped, saying, \"Bikes are fantastic, they were only considered uncool for a few years, but they're the best way to get around.\" Cycling not only provides a physical workout but is also the most efficient mode of transportation. Combining a healthy breakfast with moderate exercise can cover considerable distances, such as 30 miles or more. As many undergraduates do, I now reside off-campus, at a similar distance from the campus center as some dorms. This academic year, the most intelligent decision I made was purchasing a bike. Every day, I attend classes in Thomas building, which is approximately a 25-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike significantly reduces this time to just 5 minutes if I pedal at a decent pace. Nevertheless, Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my residence, but it's not always a straightforward road to travel on, whether I'm on a bike or not. While walking has its advantages, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn't own a bike, walking would be my only reliable means of transportation to class, which would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day. This translates to over 2.5 hours every week, not to mention the additional time spent walking to other classes, appointments, and various other activities. This is more time than I can afford to spare."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "My goal is to pursue a career with the Division of Family and Children Services to make a positive impact on the lives of children who have been abused or neglected, and to provide support to struggling families. As a future social worker, I will uphold the core values of service, respect, and a commitment to improving relationships and personal growth, ensuring I remain proficient in my field. These values not only resonate with the social work profession but also deeply personal to me.\n\nThroughout my educational journey, I have always been driven to help others, but I struggled to identify a specific career path. During my time in high school and college, I witnessed individuals confronting their problems with denial or unhealthy coping mechanisms. The situations I encountered motivated me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, as I sought a deeper understanding of human behavior. Although I still felt uncertain about my career path after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, a life-changing experience that summer opened my eyes to the need for social work professionals. A friend introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was struggling with abuse at home, and I soon discovered that he had turned to the authorities for help. As I learned more about the situation, I realized the gravity of the issue and the importance of supporting vulnerable children. I decided to visit the boy's parents, where I expressed my concerns to the police and shared my recent graduation from Piedmont College. Although the law couldn't intervene, I was able to speak with the parents, and their dismissive attitude towards their son's situation only strengthened my resolve to pursue a career in social work.\n\nAnother essential value for social work professionals is advocating for social justice. Our society often touts the importance of individuality, yet we often conform to traditional norms rather than embracing our true uniqueness. I believe that if we value individuality, we should not be afraid to stand out from the crowd. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively challenged social injustice, expressing myself through bold fashion choices, public declarations of support for marginalized groups, and standing up against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it. As a future social worker, I will continue to fight for social justice and advocate for those who are marginalized or oppressed.",
            "This paper delves into the relationship between biological and sociocultural models as they relate to insomnia, a prevalent sleep disorder. The biological model examines the role of genetic factors and medical health aspects in the development of insomnia, while the sociocultural model explores the impact of environmental factors, including demographics, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity. This review aims to analyze and critique existing research related to these models, focusing on their strengths and limitations.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to mental health conditions, and sleep disorders resulting from medical complications or substance use. Primary sleep disorders, such as Dyssonmias and Parasomnias, encompass various subcategories, including Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and others. Insomnia can manifest as difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep, while Hypersomnia involves excessive daytime sleepiness. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are characterized by behavioral and physiological anomalies during sleep. This review primarily focuses on insomnia and its connection to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders highlights the significance of genetic and physiological factors, including the role of neurons in the hypothalamus that regulate sleep and wakefulness. Research on mice has demonstrated that GABAB receptors in these neurons play a crucial role in sleep-wake states. The activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and improved sleep quality. Studies have shown that GABAB agonists, such as baclofen, can increase sleep duration, suggesting a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. This research implies that genetic factors can influence sleep patterns, and alterations in the receptor could lead to sleep disturbances. The sociocultural implications of this study suggest that inherited phenotypes can regulate sleep, and disruptions to the receptor could have a negative impact on daily life, affecting aspects such as education, career, and daily tasks that require focus and attention.",
            "This paper covers three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it offers a concise explanation of the condition. Next, it delves into the diagnosis process, highlighting common warning signs or characteristics associated with CAPD. Finally, the paper concludes with strategies for a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom setting to support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to how efficiently the brain processes auditory information. Essentially, it is a disorder where the brain fails to correctly interpret sounds it receives. People with CAPD can hear normally but struggle to distinguish words, separate conversations from background noise, and differentiate between various sounds due to a problem with the brain's auditory processing mechanisms.\n\nThe earliest documented references to CAPD date back to the mid-1950s, when researchers described it as \"auditory imperception.\" In the 1950s and 1960s, researchers like Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari developed tests to assess children with communication disorders, while Kimura introduced dichotic testing in 1961 to study the brain's auditory processing mechanisms. A national conference in 1977 sparked further research on CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD presents itself in various ways, such as difficulty localizing sounds in space, distinguishing between multiple sounds, recognizing sound patterns, detecting changes in speech, and integrating sounds to form meaningful information. Individuals with CAPD may struggle to filter out background noise, interpret the sequence of auditory information, and respond to auditory clues.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, healthcare professionals use a combination of observational techniques and tests that assess auditory skills, including questionnaires, surveys, and behavioral observations. These tests often involve presenting patients with multiple auditory stimuli and asking them to differentiate between specific items. While there is no single, universally effective diagnostic tool, advanced tests may involve recording auditory signals and measuring the brain's responses.",
            "Twelfth Night suggests that while disguises can be useful for carrying out deceptions, ultimately, a person must choose to shed their disguise or risk losing their true identity in the process. However, this decision comes with a significant challenge: one may end up alienating themselves from others as a result. It boils down to a difficult choice between preserving one's own identity and maintaining relationships with those around them, as some might react neutrally to being deceived, while others may be offended by the deception. \n\nThe exploration of deception through gender role reversal in the play raises further complexities, particularly the underlying reasons behind a character's decision to adopt a disguise. In the case of Viola, her decision to impersonate a man is motivated by self-preservation, as seen in her statement about seeking protection in a foreign land. Although her plan is initially successful, it leads to her isolation from the women around her and creates complications in her relationships with others, such as Olivia, who mistakes her for her twin brother Sebastian, and Orsino, with whom she develops unrequited romantic feelings.\n\nThe play also touches on the idea that deception can facilitate the expression of suppressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages imply that these characters may have unacknowledged desires that are triggered by Viola's disguise. For instance, is Olivia genuinely attracted to Cesario, or is she driven by a fascination with masculinity? The ease with which she switches her affections from Cesario to Sebastian suggests that Olivia might be parodying the superficial judgments of her time, rather than genuinely harboring feelings for women. \n\nThis is evident in her later shift in attitude towards Cesario/Viola, where she no longer views her as a romantic interest but rather as a family member, as seen in her comment, \"A sister, you are she.\"",
            "The brutality of German colonial rule, particularly in the context of the genocide against the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa, has been widely noted by observers. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the German colonial empire was multifaceted, with varied policies, ruling styles, and geographies, making a single description inadequate. Despite this complexity, the German colonial empire's educational systems showed significant diversity. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a well-educated and literate African population. Similarly, German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies received praise from contemporary authors. \n\nIn stark contrast, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast, with the government largely delegating the responsibility of native education to missionary societies that received limited government support. Conversely, the government invested considerable resources in the education of Europeans, establishing state schools and heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, persisting even after the end of German rule. Unlike other German colonies, where a significant number of Africans were literate and educated, in South West Africa, the vast majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate. Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience, and this study aims to further explore these factors by examining new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is an extensive body of literature examining education in the German colonial empire, primarily written in German during the early 20th century. Early works focused on describing the characteristics of educational systems in these colonies. Later studies, written in English, expanded the discourse by conducting comparative studies of education in various German colonies and providing in-depth analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. One notable study, conducted by Cohen, compares the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa, discussing the factors that contributed to the disparities between them. According to Cohen, the presence of a large settler population in South West Africa was a key factor in shaping the colony's educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonies, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, despite a significant portion of the territory being arid desert. This relatively favorable climate led to a substantial European population in South West Africa, with approximately 15,000 whites residing there by 1913, compared to only 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The classification of popular music has become increasingly complex over the past century, with numerous genres emerging that it is challenging to comprehensively list them all. Furthermore, most notable genres, such as rock, jazz, country, and folk, have branched out into various sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, making the classification even more intricate. Heavy Metal, a sub-genre of rock music, has particularly grown to be one of the most diverse and expressive genres in the past four decades. It is characterized by its wide range of emotions, predominantly leaning towards the darker end of the spectrum. The genre's diversity stems from its early adaptability, which allowed artists to create their own sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, resulting in a continuous chain of new variations.\n\nToday, the heavy metal movement has expanded to the point where it is challenging to define what constitutes heavy metal music. It has incorporated numerous themes from other genres, but its origins can be traced back to a specific starting point. To fully grasp the extent of metal music today, it is essential to understand the underlying principles and motivations behind the metal movement.\n\nHeavy metal music can be described as a movement that embodies darkness, often characterized by increased intensity, volume, and theatricality. It is often associated with musicians who possess exceptional technical skills and musical proficiency, which is reflected in their music. Additionally, the genre has been influenced by the use of psychedelic substances in the 1970s, which led to the creation of innovative and otherworldly music. The genre's dark, visceral qualities departed from the more conventional emotional ranges of popular music at the time. Later generations of metal musicians drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's dark and intense qualities, as evident in the lyrics of various metal songs. For instance, the lyrics from Helter Skelter, a song by the Beatles, display the darker side of their music, which was a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier and darker song. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate their ability to produce heavy music, which they showcased on their album The White Album.",
            "Long before the Surrealist artists brought their dreamlike paintings to the scene, Henri Rousseau was shaping his own dream, literally and figuratively, with his brush. In \"The Dream,\" a 1910 Post-Impressionist masterpiece, we see not only a woman marveling at the wonders of a fantastical land but also Rousseau's own aspirations as an artist. For years, he longed for the recognition, approval, and admiration of his peers, yet struggled with an internal conflict that defined his career: the desire to conform to established art styles to gain acceptance, versus the need to stay true to his unique creative voice. His painting, \"The Dream,\" embodies this lifelong inner turmoil.\n\nTo truly understand Rousseau's motivations, it's essential to delve into his background. Born in Laval, northwest France, on May 21, 1844, Henri Rousseau came from a relatively affluent family. Despite this comfort, he received no formal art training and instead worked as a gabelou for the municipal toll service in France until the age of 40. Although he was called a customs inspector, his true passion remained painting, which he turned to as a source of solace after the tragic loss of his wife and eight children left him with only one daughter, Julia. Rousseau's work differs from that of his contemporaries, who romanticized peasants, as he sought to represent the everyday life and aspirations of the common man.\n\nGiven his circumstances, Rousseau's yearning for recognition in the art world is understandable. He began painting at an older age, with little education in formal art techniques, and produced works alongside more renowned artists of the time. It wasn't until around the same period when Matisse was establishing himself as an artist that Rousseau finally received the recognition he deserved. Jan Gordon notes in his book \"Modern French Painters\" that while Matisse and Rousseau were competitors in the art world, their motivations differed: Matisse sought to avoid clichés, whereas Rousseau aimed to create something conventional enough to be accepted by the prestigious Artiste Français.",
            "Many influential thinkers have long proposed a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, suggesting that truth and beauty are intertwined. I believe that there's a fundamental reason for this. John Keats' famous quote from \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" - \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know\" - hints at this connection. While our understanding of the world often comes from education and experience, we seem to intuitively appreciate ethics and aesthetics without needing to be taught. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to explain and describe rather than dictate rules, seeking to understand why certain actions are moral or why specific works of art are beautiful. \n\nCriticism and analysis of art or morality can never fully grasp the essence of what makes something good or beautiful. When discussing the value of a piece like da Vinci's Mona Lisa, we might focus on aspects like composition, context, or cultural significance, but these elements don't capture the underlying reason why it's considered great art. People often find it difficult to put into words why they adore a particular work of art, and instead say something like \"there's just something about it.\" Similarly, Flannery O'Connor noted that a story can convey something that cannot be expressed in any other way. No matter how thoroughly we analyze a work of literature, there's always an intangible, transcendent quality that remains unexplained. I propose that ethics shares this same property, as suggested by Ludwig Wittgenstein's statement that ethics cannot be fully expressed. This elusive, unexplainable aspect is the most powerful attribute of both art and morality, and it's what connects them. \n\nBecause both art and ethics touch us at a fundamental, experiential level that's difficult to put into words, they're closely linked. This connection is particularly strong when it comes to literature, as McKean pointed out, \"Literature is unique among the arts in its moral quality.\" While moral standards may not be relevant to other art forms like music, they're deeply relevant to literature and to life itself. As living beings, we're driven by values, and literature's importance stems from the values we find within it.",
            "Germany is currently a unified country with a distinct culture that spans from the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea in Kiel, as well as from Cologne on the Rhine River to Dresden on the Elbe River. This unique blend of culture is a result of the country's diverse history and the various tribes that shaped it. Germania, the ancestral homeland of the Germans, has a disputed etymology. Scholars and historians disagree on the origins of the name, with some attributing it to the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe mentioned by the Roman historian Tacitus. He noted that they were previously known as Germans before crossing the Rhine River and battling the Gauls.\n\nThe Roman leader Julius Caesar is credited with first using the term \"Germanus\" in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, which he used to distinguish between the Gauls and the Germanic tribes he encountered. However, the meaning of the term is unclear, with some believing it referred to a neighboring tribe in the Gaulish language, while others suggest it may have come from the word \"ger,\" a type of spear used in warfare. Another theory suggests that it may be derived from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were known for their loud and noisy nature.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote in his book \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" that the Germans were aboriginal and had not been influenced by other cultures through immigration or trade. He noted that the harsh climate, rugged country, and unfriendly demeanor of Germany would make it an unappealing destination for outsiders, and that the Romans would only send expeditions to Germania for trade and conquest, but would ultimately return to their empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the fringes of the Roman Empire, trading goods and skills with the Romans in exchange for their military service.",
            "I stood gazing down, my mind blank and taking in the scene before me without any emotional attachment. My thoughts were fleeting and unconnected, slipping in and out of my consciousness like ripples on a smooth lake. My perception of the world seemed effortless and fluid, as if I was merely observing without any personal thoughts or biases.\n\nEarlier, I had attempted to tap into my creative side by following the advice of an artist I worked with, who recommended the book \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had always been fascinated by drawing and this book provided a comprehensive guide, covering even the basics such as understanding the properties of a pencil and the brain's processes for interpreting lines. One technique from the book that stuck with me was the idea of framing a subject within a square, simplifying complex scenes into more manageable compositions. However, at that moment, I found it impossible to mentally impose such a frame on the present scene. The messy, overwhelming sight before me left me awestruck, and I stood frozen in wonder.\n\nAs I thought about it, I realized that I was standing in the midst of creating my own art piece, or at least, the beginning of one. Like the masters who influenced me – Picasso's blue period, Monet's love of greenery, or the Renaissance masters' vibrant palette – I too had a unique perspective to contribute. I had a vision, and the tools to bring it to life. With a surge of inspiration, my hand instinctively reached for the pencil, and my fingers began to move with a life of their own, bringing my vision into being.\n\nHowever, my creative moment was short-lived. My hand jerked and spasmed as I tried to dislodge the clogged toilet, and I was left staring at the stubborn brown mass that refused to budge. Clutching the mop, I stood frozen, my green tie constricting my neck, and my expression turned sour as I gazed at the unwanted surprise left by someone else. After a few tense moments, I stooped to grab the toilet paper and wrapped it around my hand like a protective glove, before plunging it into the toilet bowl with a sense of trepidation. The task was far from elegant, but it was a necessary one, and I proceeded with a mix of reluctance and duty.",
            "Teen drivers are facing a high risk of accidents, leading to tragic outcomes. Several interrelated factors contribute to this alarming trend among young American drivers. According to the National Institutes of Health, the primary issue lies in the fact that the teenage brain is still developing and not fully equipped to handle the dangers associated with driving. This inexperience not only results in a higher number of fatal crashes but also increases the likelihood of rollover accidents, speeding, and driving off the road. Moreover, when teens drive with their peers, the risk of accidents significantly escalates, as a study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a direct correlation between passenger age and the frequency of traffic accidents.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, California and other states have implemented temporary provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit minors from riding with teen drivers. However, these measures are only temporary solutions to a deeper problem. As a group, young drivers are, statistically speaking, unable to effectively manage the risks and responsibilities associated with driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman suggests that 18 is too young for a full driver's license, citing research that highlights a common desire among those under 19-20 to engage in thrill-seeking behavior. Delaying driving until this tendency has diminished is, therefore, a sensible approach. Continuing to issue licenses to young teens will only lead to more deadly crashes and a substantial increase in the death toll in the coming years. With millions of new teen drivers expected to hit the road by 2010, the need for effective legislation becomes increasingly pressing.\n\nImplementing legislation to address this issue is a relatively straightforward process. Schools can continue to provide driver's education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 should be allowed to operate a vehicle. A provisional permit can still be issued before a full license is granted, and a set number of practical driving hours can be required. The number of hours could be based on the existing requirements in most states, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice. A national, uniform approach to this issue would be a reasonable and effective means of protecting teen drivers across the country. The proposed legislation is not a new concept, but it is a necessary step towards reducing the alarming statistics surrounding teen drivers.",
            "While reviewing the early Edison films housed in the Library of Congress, I opted to examine the entire collection of trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. There were a total of fifteen films, which largely utilized creative editing techniques to create illusions. My study primarily focused on analyzing the aesthetic principles behind most of these trick films and identifying the distinct features that emerged in some of the later ones. The early trick films, which were produced at the turn of the century, were primarily set-bound, featuring static compositions, a static camera, and adherence to the rule of using one shot per film. However, a few films from the beginning of the 20th century began to deviate from these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne of the defining characteristics of trick films is their use of an interior set within a frontal proscenium, which was a common feature in both early cinema and vaudeville and magic performances. The camera remained stationary, following neither the movement of characters nor objects. This composition was inspired by the theatrical and vaudeville traditions. As a result, characters in these films often moved horizontally, rarely moving towards or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors entered from the right side, moving left and right within the frame. Even when they exited, the camera did not track their movement.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition also led to the use of long and medium shots, with close-ups being extremely rare in trick films. This stylistic choice was influenced by the theatrical and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance, framed within the stage borders. In these early films, actors typically remained in the middle ground and did not move towards the camera, making close-ups impossible. The majority of trick films followed the rule of one conceptual shot per film, limiting their length to around a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This constraint also restricted the narrative and dramatic potential of these films, with most focusing on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic and illusions. Notably, however, a single shot may consist of multiple joined physical shots, used to create the illusion of disappearance or apparition, as seen in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). A closer examination of this film reveals the moment when the physical shot of Mary's severed head begins, even though the entire film is perceived as a single shot by the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a strong advocate for Republicanism in its early stages. As an agriculturalist and briefly involved in politics, he became known for his unwavering dedication to individual liberties and government accountability. His agricultural background significantly influenced his views on governance, with his commitment to a rural way of life forming the foundation of his opinions on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to establish an ideal system of self-governance, free from the constraints of native traditions. He firmly believed in the importance of natural human rights, which he considered interconnected and equally essential. In his opinion, denying one right would undermine the value of all others, and governments should not interfere with these inalienable rights. Taylor equated the concept of the \"state of nature\" with the idea that those with physical strength and malicious intentions often held power, but he argued that in a civilized society, this should not be the case.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor thought that the government should acknowledge the inherent duality of human nature, encompassing both good and evil. He was unyielding in his belief in a dualistic morality, stating that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" Taylor defined good principles as those that safeguard private property, promote agriculture, and discourage capitalist exploitation. He believed that a government founded on these principles would function fairly, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by self-interest and avarice. Taylor recognized self-interest as a fundamental human motivation, but only considered it detrimental when it led to the creation of sub-groups that exploited others at the expense of the community. A well-designed government was necessary to balance humanity's natural flaws and prevent the introduction of adverse principles.\n\nLike many staunch Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, with a minimalist Federal government possessing only explicitly stated rights and powers. He was aware that an extensive Federal government would be costly and potentially tyrannical. However, he also recognized the dangers of a simplistic, literal interpretation, which could become corrupted without considering the original intent of the Constitution's authors. Furthermore, Taylor regarded the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it explicitly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking at Figure 17, we can see that there was a significant decline in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was a cause for concern, and pinpointing the reason behind it is challenging. The onset of winter on a New England campus undoubtedly led to a decrease in foot and bicycle traffic, which might have contributed to the decline. The end of the fall semester in December, when students were busy with coursework, assessments, and other tasks, could also have pushed the commuter log to the back burner for many individuals. Furthermore, the holiday season in December brought a longer break for students and faculty, reducing the need for campus visits. The low log submissions in January might be attributed to the preceding break. However, the persistently low numbers in February remain unexplained. It's possible that projects like this one experience an initial surge of enthusiasm, followed by a natural decline in engagement. To counter this trend, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week, a targeted campaign in March that succeeded in boosting log submissions for that month. One of the key challenges we faced was maintaining momentum despite the natural decrease in engagement and the unique challenges posed by academic breaks. \n\nAnother hurdle for this project is the cultural preference for driving a car, which offers a sense of freedom, independence, and flexibility. To overcome this, we needed to offer incentives for alternative modes of transportation. We provided gift cards to local businesses, including restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores, in an attempt to encourage participation. It would have been interesting to see how larger prizes, such as a bicycle or electric car, could have impacted engagement. Increasing the value of prizes over time might have been more effective in sustaining interest. While the initial gift cards were sufficient at the start, announcing larger prizes in subsequent months could have reversed the decline in participation.",
            "An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that tracks an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets akin to an index fund, but offers more flexibility and trades on an exchange like a stock. By investing in an ETF, you can reap the benefits of diversification, similar to an index fund, along with the advantages of owning individual stocks, such as the ability to short sell, buy on margin, and purchase as few shares as one in any transaction. Although these benefits are highly appealing, ETFs typically come with lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund. However, there are drawbacks to consider, including the commission fees associated with buying and selling ETFs, similar to those charged for stock transactions. Furthermore, ETFs offer a wide range of investment options. It is essential for savvy financial investors to critically evaluate the actual benefits, such as diversification, and their extent before investing. For this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to determine if the benefits of owning a single ETF match the advantages of a diversified portfolio of the same stocks and whether there are better configurations of the same stocks that would yield a more optimal risk-return profile.\n\nTo simplify the evaluation process, we have chosen to focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. Below is a list of the top 10 holdings and their corresponding percentage of total assets.\n\nTo gauge how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, to estimate the contribution of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consisted entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF's holdings. The calculations of Beta and Return are presented in the chart below.\n\nAs shown in the chart, a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings would yield a Return that is 6.11% higher than the ETF's Return, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF. From the results obtained so far, it appears that a portfolio consisting of just the top 10 holdings may offer higher returns with lower risk. However, it is possible that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different.\n\nTo further assess whether these portfolios are statistically different, we calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% for comparison with the ETF IHF's standard deviation.",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is one of Edgar Allan Poe's most notable poems, which heavily employs the term \"Thulé\" – a concept initially linked to Virgil's work. Virgil used this term to refer to an island north of Britain, which the ancient Greeks viewed as the edge of the known world. However, it's essential to acknowledge a more contemporary source that influenced Poe's use of this term. Poe was deeply interested in the works of German authors, particularly Goethe, whose writing often resonated with him.\n\nThe significance of this reference lies in its demonstration of Poe's familiarity with Goethe's works. Karl J. Arndt's book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\" points out the striking similarities between their poems, suggesting that Poe may have been inspired by Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts, with the second installment appearing in 1832, the year of his death. Within \"Faust,\" there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells the story of a king who becomes consumed by grief after his wife's passing and ultimately dies. The King of Thulé's character shares eerie similarities with the figure in \"Dream-Land,\" possibly serving as a dark parallel to Poe's own struggles with loss and addiction. Another adaptation of \"Faust\" was created by H. P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe's use of the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe referenced Thule twice in his writings, using the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land\" as its bookends. Reading \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" together reveals a striking connection between the two works. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a desolate landscape of Thule, haunted by deceased friends, and a world devoid of color. These scenes mirror the King of Thule's emotional state in Goethe's poem, where the king is overcome with grief and loneliness after his wife's passing, leading him to lose interest in ruling and living. This parallel between the two poems suggests that Poe drew inspiration from Goethe's work, as if he had stepped into Goethe's poem.\n\nAs a prominent author, Goethe was well-known and respected by Poe, in part due to his admiration for Tennyson. Additionally, since Poe was exposed to Goethe's work through various reproductions and adaptations that followed the original publication, it is likely that Poe was familiar with Goethe's writing even if not directly influenced by Tennyson's connection to him.",
            "To determine whether a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a California grocery store could recover punitive damages, the court would evaluate if the store manager's actions demonstrated a reckless disregard for potential harm. A customer, Jennifer Palmer, may have a valid claim if she can prove that the store manager, Paul Martin, was informed of the spill twice but deliberately chose not to address it for 30 minutes while he ate dinner. \n\nA judge is unlikely to dismiss Palmer's punitive damage claim without a proper review. To justify punitive damages, Palmer must provide evidence that Martin's actions were taken with a deliberate intent to disregard the probable harm caused by the spill, and that his conduct was also despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have anticipated the potential harm of the spill, given that several customers had slipped and fallen in the same store in the preceding months. \n\nAlthough Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable may not be strongly supported, it is still a reasonable claim considering that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009 and Martin failed to take necessary safety precautions. \n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, informed Martin about the applesauce spill; however, Martin responded that he was on dinner break and couldn't handle customer complaints. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin of the spill, but he gave the same response. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious injury. Before Palmer's accident, five slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D Markets in 2009.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of duty not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Under the California Civil Code, malice is defined as conduct intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" \n\nCourts have found conduct to be malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, especially when the defendant was aware of the probable consequences of their actions and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.",
            "It has been almost four years since I took a course in Islam at CBC, where a crucial topic of discussion was whether Islam is a hostile religion. The issue remains just as relevant today as it was back then, especially when looking at the events since 9/11. The media's perception of Islam has shifted dramatically from being hostile towards extremists to being overly tolerant in the US, and I believe this trend is a significant change. Considering the 2001 presidential election, it's unlikely that a candidate like Barack Obama, who has a clear Muslim background in his family, could have been a contender back then.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography has always fascinated me because it seems to contradict the common perception of his personality. Based on my understanding of history, I thought Muhammad was known for forcing conversions to Islam, conquering tribes, and imposing his faith on them. However, the biography portrays him as a misunderstood leader who was humble and self-effacing, which is quite different from what I initially knew. It describes how people gradually came to accept his teachings after witnessing his humility and kindness.\n\nInterestingly, there are some intriguing similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the miraculous events attributed to Muhammad. One such example is when he multiplied food to feed a large group of people. The way the story is written makes me think that the authors aimed to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, but simply lived a life of truth and performed miracles. This approach downplays the significance of Jesus Christ's life and miracles, and I find it problematic as it appears to be an attempt to borrow from Jesus' narrative.\n\nThe biography also includes many stories that seem to serve as proof of people's personal experiences of converting to Islam. However, these stories are often based on third-party accounts, which makes me skeptical. I believe that presenting these stories in this manner diminishes their credibility and raises more questions about their authenticity.\n\nWhat bothers me most about the biography is the way it portrays Muhammad as a godly, humble, endearing, wise, and gentle figure. However, historical records contradict this image of Muhammad, and I often wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true circumstances surrounding his rise to power.",
            "Christian thought rapidly diverged from its original teachings and principles after Jesus' death, and over time, a significant movement away from its core values became apparent.  However, as societal awareness and progressive thinking continue to grow, there's a prospect that Christians will return to their faith's authentic roots.  As people become more aware of the history of their faith, they will begin to distinguish between the original teachings of Jesus and the additional doctrines that were introduced over time.  This process will likely take several decades or even centuries, but it is inevitable.  Ultimately, the result will be a shift towards a return to the original form of Christianity, stripping away layers of accumulated doctrine.  As this trend gains momentum, particularly in the US and Europe, it will lead to a more uniform understanding and practice of the faith, reducing the current diversity of beliefs and denominations.  History has shown us that reversals of this nature are possible, such as the fall of Christianity from being persecuted to becoming the dominant institution in the Roman Empire, and the transition from slavery to equality for African-Americans.  A reversal of this kind is also anticipated in the Christian faith, which will involve seeking the sources of the religion and reducing diversity in the process.  To facilitate this, it is crucial to interpret Jesus' words metaphorically rather than literally.  By looking back into history, we find that the Jewish faith, which is the basis of Christianity, was already present before the Roman Empire's rule in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish community was initially united, but later divided into different groups such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people, showcasing a lack of unity among them.",
            "The Jungle by Upton Sinclair vividly portrays the inherent selfishness and self-centered nature of humanity. People are primarily motivated by their desire to improve their own lives and circumstances, disregarding the well-being of those below them in the social hierarchy. This is exemplified through the character of the factory owners and managers. Their sole focus is on expanding their businesses and increasing their wealth, disregarding the harm caused to the environment and the people who suffer as a result. Sinclair uses descriptive language, such as the image of factory chimneys releasing smoke into the air, to illustrate the detrimental impact of their actions. The owners and managers show a blatant disregard for their employees, treating them as nothing more than a means to an end. They prioritize profits over people, forcing their workers to toil in hazardous conditions and terminate them without warning or compensation. The era in which the novel is set lacked regulations to protect workers' rights, allowing the factory owners to exploit their employees. The working-class people in Packingtown were essentially trapped, with no access to resources or support to help them escape their plight. The absence of effective aid and the prevalence of corrupt unions only exacerbated their struggles, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation. The novel describes the workers as being in a state of servitude, highlighting the inevitability and prevalence of immorality in such a system.",
            "Several authors employ various techniques to evoke a particular emotion or perspective in their readers. Some methods are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald exemplifies this by utilizing various techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. One of these techniques involves pairing an adjective with an unrelated noun to create a distinct atmosphere around a subject. Alternatively, he assigns significance to a symbol and later uses it to convey a particular feeling. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald uses this technique with colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink, giving them specific meanings. By doing so, he creates an association between these colors and a particular atmosphere in the novel.\n\nFitzgerald develops and applies the meaning of white/gray, which represents uniformity. He portrays white as representing refinement and high social status, while gray signifies age and dullness. At the beginning of the novel, Fitzgerald frequently uses both colors to establish this meaning. For instance, Daisy and Jordan are often depicted wearing white, and this is not unique to them; Nick also wears white flannels to Gatsby's party, while Tom wears a white shirt when meeting Myrtle. The only time white is absent is when Nick describes his initial impressions of Gatsby's party, where the halls are painted with primary colors. Fitzgerald further reinforces these colors by applying them to ordinary, insignificant subjects, such as the white chasms of lower New York and gray names on Nick's schedule. He also uses white and gray to describe common, unremarkable people or places, like the \"white girlhood\" Daisy and Jordan shared, the \"gray cars and gray land\" in the valley of ashes, and the \"gray old man\" selling dogs. After establishing the meaning of white and gray, Fitzgerald employs them to signify the lack of significance or uniformity of certain subjects.\n\nFitzgerald initially introduces the technique of using colors to convey meaning when describing Daisy. After a period with minimal use of the colors, he reappears with Daisy wearing a white dress, which reduces her character to a uniform, unremarkable entity that Gatsby desires. This technique is further utilized by Fitzgerald to portray Daisy in a more uniform and unremarkable light. For example, her fur collar is described as a \"gray haze,\" and she is again dressed in white before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "The San Diego County region is notable for its high agricultural productivity, largely due to its pleasant climate and abundant sunlight. Farmers in the area cultivate a diverse range of crops, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. A significant demand exists for locally sourced, organic produce, resulting in long waiting lists for community-supported agriculture programs. Organic dairy products, such as eggs and milk, are also in high demand. Many organic farms in the area offer guided tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for outdoor activities like hiking and birdwatching. This type of agricultural operation allows landowners to take advantage of government incentives while promoting habitat conservation, enabling recreational use, and creating opportunities for educational programs and tours.\n\nIn addition to catering to a lucrative niche market, organic farming often brings about increased biodiversity in the surrounding area due to the absence of chemical pesticides and fertilizers in the soil and water. However, organic farming can be more labor-intensive and costly compared to conventional farming methods. It requires more hands-on care to manage pests, weeds, and soil quality without using chemicals, leading to potentially higher losses. Small-scale organic farms also face efficiency challenges due to their limited size compared to larger operations. Furthermore, implementing beneficial non-organic practices, such as planting cover crops, controlling invasive species, and managing plant growth, can incur additional labor costs.\n\nConsidering these factors, a landowner in this scenario may seek financial assistance or expert guidance to maximize both profits and environmental quality. The chosen land, located near the town of Potrero in San Diego County, California, comprises 160 acres of chaparral, non-native grasslands, and oak woodlands adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This area is situated within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently evaluates over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered or threatened, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and several butterfly species.\n\nHistorically, this land was inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood traders in the late 19th century. The property was part of a homestead patent and likely used for grazing and wood harvesting for many years. To explore available government programs and their potential benefits for small farmers, I selected a piece of land from a real estate website and researched relevant options. For the purpose of this example, I examined an organic farm in the same area to illustrate a realistic approach to balancing economic viability with wildlife conservation.",
            "Negotiations are heavily influenced by the cultural context in which they take place. Culture can be defined as much by its nuances as by its explicit characteristics. It is not a uniform or monolithic entity, but rather a complex tapestry of various aspects. Generalizations, such as assuming all members of a particular culture share the same traits, are overly simplistic and inaccurate. To be effective in negotiations, it is more productive to understand how a culture's values and attitudes relate to the specific issue at hand and how they may impact the negotiation process. When interacting with a foreign culture, individuals often draw comparisons to their own culture, leading to a more relatable understanding.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset can involve exploring its history, traditions, and biases. Rather than judging or trying to alter a culture, it is essential to accept it for what it is and work within its boundaries, particularly in negotiations. When in a weaker bargaining position, respecting traditions and beliefs can help bridge cultural divides and facilitate progress in negotiations. The cultural landscape is not limited to a national or international divide; corporate cultures can be just as distinct, with variations in work-life balance, communication styles, and values. For instance, a company may prioritize long work hours or a more relaxed atmosphere, and these differences can be seen in employee dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. \n\nIt is vital to consider the underlying values that shape a culture, as they provide the foundation for its behavior. In cultures where preserving face or communal harmony is crucial, a negotiator would be unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superior to achieve success at the negotiation table. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that values a hard-driving approach may be less inclined to settle for the first available option. Taking these cultural nuances into account before the negotiation can significantly improve the outcome. Nevertheless, it is also essential for a negotiator to gain a personal understanding of their opponent to achieve effective results.",
            "The statement \"There is no God\" is attributed to the fool in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and it forms the foundation of St. Anselm's argument for the existence of God. Similarly, Thomas Aquinas defends the same concept, making it essential to consider both their arguments side by side. Given that our objective is to compare their reasoning, we will assume that both thinkers believe in the God of the Bible, as a hypothetical God-like figure could dilute the comparison since their arguments are specifically tailored to this particular concept. Although both authors present valid points, we argue that neither provides a comprehensive basis for believing in God.\n\nTo illustrate this point, let's examine the core idea of St. Anselm's argument. Anselm suggests a path to understanding God through introspection, contending that the existence of God can be deduced from within one's own mind. According to Anselm, since we cannot imagine a God's nonexistence, it implies that God's existence is inherent in our understanding. This concept, while articulated in Anselm's own terminology, essentially proposes that the truth about God is accessible through self-reflection, without requiring external evidence. This perspective is closely tied to the Christian concept of faith, which often involves accepting truths without definitive empirical proof.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas presents a different perspective, advocating that the existence of God can be proven solely through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith. This approach would be advantageous in evangelism, as it would enable the conversion of new followers without relying on their willingness to accept unproven claims. Aquinas outlines five logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. By demonstrating the logical necessity of God's existence, Aquinas argues that we can infer the existence of God without needing to see direct evidence.",
            "Around 2,500 years ago, a prince who would eventually be known as the Buddha was born, marking the beginning of a spiritual journey that would eventually lead to the establishment of Buddhism. Over the course of his life, he abandoned worldly life and achieved enlightenment, leaving behind a legacy of teachings that have undergone significant transformations over time. This evolution is evident in countries like Sri Lanka, where the Theravada nation celebrates the annual water-cutting ceremony, which has no basis in the Buddha's original teachings. The differences between the original teachings and the current practices are so profound that they span from superficial traditions to the fundamental principles of the religion. As a result, the Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt its core beliefs, influenced by both internal and external factors, ranging from friendly to hostile.\n\nTo better understand this discussion, it is essential to note the distinction between internal and external forces. Internal forces refer to changes driven by the Buddhist community itself, regardless of their monastic status, while external forces originate from non-Buddhists. Additionally, hostile forces aim to harm or damage the Buddhist community, whereas benign forces neither intend to harm nor help the community, although their actions might have unintended consequences.\n\nThis analysis begins by examining the fundamental principles of Theravada Buddhism. At its core, Buddhists seek refuge in the Triple Gem, consisting of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma encompasses the Tripitaka, a collection of three baskets of sacred texts, including the Sutta Pitaka, which contains sermons, the Vinaya Pitaka, which outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, which delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These metaphysical concepts, such as Anatta (the absence of a permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (the impermanence of all things), are the keys to escaping Sansara, the cycle of rebirth and death, and ultimately achieving liberation from lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). In the Vinaya Pitaka, guidelines for laypeople and monks are outlined, including the five precepts for laymen and a more extensive set of rules for monks. The most fundamental principles of Buddhism revolve around the four noble truths: Dukkha (the truth of suffering), the cause of suffering (attachment), and the possibility of overcoming suffering.",
            "A notable example of a long-standing rivalry between two nations is the relationship between the United States and Mexico, which endured for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. This animosity reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the U.S. successfully defeated Mexico, gaining control of Texas and the American Southwest. The rivalry between the two nations was marked by various conflicts, which gradually subsided before the onset of World War I. Initially, the disagreement stemmed from fundamental differences in religion, culture, and tradition, as well as competing material interests. \n\nThis scenario is reminiscent of numerous other nations that share a border, often leading to clashes of interests and the formation of rival positions. The U.S. and Mexico's relationship is similar to other long-standing rivalries between neighboring countries. David M. Pletcher notes that Mexico and Cuba are the only two nations with long-standing issues in their diplomatic relations with the U.S. (Pletcher 1977, p. 41). Given their geographical proximity to the U.S., these countries have historically been its rivals, whereas other Latin American nations have generally enjoyed good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences created a significant divide between the two nations, a common issue that has affected many countries throughout history. According to Sally Frahm, Americans have historically opposed Catholicism and monarchy, mirroring their opposition to fascism and communism in the 20th century (Frahm 2001, p. 86). This rivalry, like the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, was partly driven by ideological differences and partly by competition over vital interests. However, in this case, the ideological struggles revolved around the two nations' differing religious preferences, inherited from their former colonial rulers and contributing to their distrust of each other. This legacy of distrust posed a significant obstacle to establishing friendly relations between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 disputes between Mexico and the U.S. during the 57-year period of rivalry. Most of these disputes concerned territorial issues, such as cross-border raids and frontier problems. The issue of border raids by outlaws and bandits from American border towns was a persistent problem that was eventually addressed through joint military efforts by both countries (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry between the two nations began to dissipate as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the U.S. and American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (Schmitt 1974, p. 110). This marked the beginning of the end of the long-standing rivalry between the two nations in the late 19th century.",
            "It has been fifteen years since an unexpected illness left me disabled, erasing my identity as a nurse, a profession I had chosen as a means of achieving stability. I was driven by a deep-seated desire for security, which was a result of my tumultuous childhood. The notion that I would always be able to find employment, as people would always require medical care, resonated with me, and so I pursued nursing despite my true aspirations to be a scientist or journalist. However, life had other plans, and at 46, I found myself penniless and unable to work. Fifteen years of living on disability benefits have left me with nothing to call my own, and every day is a struggle to maintain my sense of security and self-worth. \n\nIt's a harsh reality that even the strongest individuals need help during times of crisis, and I owe my survival to the unwavering support of my family and close friends. The truth is, we are not invincible, and even the most resilient people crumble when faced with real adversity. \n\nMy point is that life is unpredictable, and no matter how well-prepared we think we are, there will always be challenges that surpass our capabilities. The notion that we should rely solely on our own abilities to overcome difficulties is misguided. In the United States, I believe it's time to shift our focus from solely relying on the government to a more community-driven approach, where individuals learn to trust and support one another. This mindset is rooted in the country's history, as our forefathers thrived during difficult times not through rugged individualism, but through compassion, mutual respect, and resource sharing. The pioneers who traversed the American West in wagon trains did not achieve their goals alone; they relied on each other for support.\n\nWhile it's essential to be prepared for emergencies, having a disaster kit, first aid supplies, and other essentials is not a substitute for building strong relationships with those around us. I advocate for a balanced approach that combines preparedness with a sense of community and mutual aid. If feasible, investing in a small farm, a wood stove, or other self-sufficiency measures can be beneficial, but it's equally crucial to foster connections with your neighbors and be willing to ask for help when needed.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in a particular way remains a complex and unanswered one. Despite the efforts of scientists like D'Arcy Thompson, who made groundbreaking statements on the subject in 1917, there is still a long way to go in defining the intricate patterns of organic forms. Recent studies have applied mathematical modeling to better understand the development of shells in mollusks, a field pioneered by researchers such as Raup and Stanley in 1981. Our research is focused on using mathematical models of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in the species Prunum in conjunction with experimental studies to uncover the underlying mechanisms that guide the direction and magnitude of evolutionary change. By analyzing X-ray images of Prunum species, we have identified quantitative parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters were inputted into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995) to simulate various shell shapes and sizes.\n\nA shell can be envisioned as a cylindrical structure that progresses through 360 degrees of space over time. Each complete rotation of the shell is referred to as a whorl, which spirals around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which the whorls expand can vary, and a continuous line separating each whorl is called a suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the final one, known as the body whorl. The central part of the shell, excluding the last whorl, is referred to as the spire. The spire's tip is the apex, while the opposite end is the base. The shell's opening, through which the animal emerges, is called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various perspectives, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. In standard orientation, the shell is viewed from the apertural perspective, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count the number of whorls, an observer must first view the shell from the apical perspective and identify the starting point of the first suture. A line is then drawn to divide the shell into two parts, and the whorls are counted from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of openings that move through time and space as the animal builds its shell. By tracking the path of the aperture using the coordinates of the center of each whorl's opening and its horizontal and vertical radius, it is possible to graphically and mathematically represent the shell's development. Once a mathematical model is established, it can be modified by varying parameters to alter the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained largely unchanged over the past decade.  Despite Indonesia being on track to meet several Millennium Development Goals, such as its targets for water and sanitation, the country is struggling to make sufficient progress in improving child and maternal health. The impending deadline of 2015 for achieving these goals is now looming, and the underlying reasons for this stagnation will be explored below. These reasons highlight the need to revamp the overall healthcare system rather than focusing solely on specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has made some advancements in the number of births attended by skilled healthcare professionals, with 72% now meeting this benchmark. However, this statistic includes traditional workers like midwives, who may not have the necessary medical expertise to handle complicated pregnancies, contributing to the significant number of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhaging. Consequently, the progress in this area is somewhat misleading, and more work remains to be done. Furthermore, there has been a decline in the proportion of children under five treated by a healthcare professional for diarrheal cases, and the data on postnatal care is incomplete, revealing a pressing concern that warrants attention.\n\nThe rate of cesarean sections is still lower than expected, standing at around 4%. This figure also underscores a more pressing issue, as the rate of cesarean sections in urban settings is significantly higher (7%) compared to rural areas (2%). This disparity highlights the unequal distribution of healthcare services, with access largely concentrated in urban areas. Another issue is the vertical inequity in healthcare access, where there is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the underprivileged face significant barriers in accessing healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nWhen considering the next steps towards enhancing neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is how to effectively address the shortage of healthcare services. Specifically, Indonesia should decide whether to develop targeted program-specific approaches or strengthen its overall healthcare system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children. While programmatic approaches may be attractive, offering targeted, manageable objectives and faster results, they also have some drawbacks. One significant disadvantage is that investing heavily in a particular area of the health sector can divert resources away from other essential areas, causing a shortage of human resources in those areas. Another issue is the duplication and lack of coordination between programs, resulting in excessive paperwork and administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian novels are characterized by their meticulous descriptions and a focus on the upper class of the time period. However, two novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, diverge from this tradition by incorporating elements of mystery and the unconventional. These novels use these mysterious elements to provide insight into their characters' motivations and emotions, making them more complex and believable. \n\nCharles Dickens' writing in Oliver Twist exemplifies this use of mystery through dream sequences and dreamlike states. In this novel, these strange events often reveal Oliver's inner turmoil, the sources of his pain, and his growing awareness of the harsh realities surrounding him. For instance, when Oliver is shot in chapter 28, he vividly relives the event, still reeling from the trauma. The passage highlights Oliver's lack of control over the situation, as well as the dire state of his health, which is vividly portrayed through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, and his senses become numb as he is carried away by an unseen force. This experience is a powerful portrayal of Oliver's helplessness, as he is unable to influence the outcome of the event, even when his life is at risk. This reinforces the notion that Oliver lacks agency, and a growing sense of defeat is implied, as if Fagin's influence has broken him, leading to a state of despair. It can be inferred that Oliver would have taken action to save himself if he had not been so consumed by hopelessness. \n\nSimilarly, in the same novel, Dickens uses another passage to convey the sense of time distortion and despair that Oliver experiences: \"The day passed off quickly – in fact, it was over before it had begun – and night came on again, a long and dreadful night that seemed to last forever, yet was fleeting and short-lived.\"",
            "It's been a while since I was involved in an after-school tutoring program for elementary school students. My main focus was helping them with any subject they were struggling with, but my strengths lay in English and reading. I was approached by one of the instructors to work with a boy named Adrian, who was having significant trouble with reading. Initially, it seemed like he had a peculiar issue, as some letters he could pronounce correctly, while others were completely off. Adrian's background was Latino, but he spoke fluent English. We continued to work together until I met his mother, who only spoke Spanish. Despite my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate. It was then that I realized Adrian's reading struggles were not due to his ability to read, but rather his unfamiliarity with the English alphabet. I'm not sure if this insight helped him much, but I hope he's made progress since then.\n\nI share this story to highlight the challenge of language barriers in schools, particularly in California. It's clear that this is a widespread issue, even among students who speak English fluently. It can be a significant obstacle for them, and it's essential that we find a solution. In Adrian's case, the solution was straightforward: targeted English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children who barely speak English, the solution is more complex. There is no one-size-fits-all answer, and it requires a combination of various approaches. These might include dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, or a combination of these. The key is to integrate multiple strategies.\n\nThe dual language system is an excellent concept, not just for students whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Research has shown that students in two-way bilingual education programs tend to outperform their peers academically. Many people fear that implementing such programs will be a waste of resources and only benefit a minority of students. However, this is a misconception. If we made dual language programs the norm, rather than the exception, all students would benefit from them. The challenge lies in implementing this, such as providing bilingual support staff, including tutors, aides, or other specialists, to assist teachers in the classroom. While it may be unrealistic to require all teachers to be bilingual, having bilingual support staff can make a significant difference.",
            "From a young age, many of us are first introduced to the idea that there exists something greater than ourselves, something that transcends our understanding.  We may receive instruction in this concept through various channels, such as attending Sunday school, visiting a temple, or exploring our own inner selves.  While some people readily accept the spiritual traditions passed down to them by their parents, others reject them outright, convinced that there is no truth beyond their own perception.  As we navigate life, we often question and reassess our values and beliefs, adopting new perspectives and spiritual paths that resonate with us.  In our search for meaning and purpose, we seek guidance to lead us out of darkness and into the light.\n\nIn a moment of introspection, my father shared with me his favorite type of bird, the cardinal, as we sat together on the porch, listening to the rain pour down on the tin roof.  His distant gaze into the rain suggested a mix of contemplation and reminiscence.  His frail appearance, accentuated by the loss of weight and a receding hairline, made me feel a sense of isolation and fear.  I avoided discussing my sadness about his impending loss, aware that acknowledging it would make it harder for both of us to cope.  I instinctively drew closer to him, and we sat together in silence, watching the rain during the twilight of June.\n\nMy father passed away in December, just five days after my 22nd birthday.  Despite the chemotherapy and radiation, he had lived a few months longer than the doctors had predicted, but his suffering only prolonged the agony.  I wondered if a higher power could have done something to ease his pain.  During that difficult night, I did not pray, questioning the existence of a God who seemed to have abandoned me. \n\nI had not wanted to witness my father's departure from this life, and so I chose not to be present.  I did not want to remember him by how he died but by how he lived.  I knew my father better than anyone else, and I believed he would not have wanted me to be a bystander at his death.  I spent three days in a state of emotional numbness, waiting for the news, but no one reached out to me.",
            "The Gothic novel is a contradictory concept, as Ian Watt describes it, combining the ideas of 'old' and 'new' in a single entity. The genre has received both criticism and praise, with some viewing it as lacking depth and others appreciating its ability to evoke a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). When Horace Walpole created the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, he drew upon the elements of both ancient and modern romances to create a new form of literary expression. By merging \"old\" theatrical characteristics with the \"new\" style of modern novels, Walpole coined the term \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre frequently incorporates elements from medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. At the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication, the term \"Gothic\" was used to describe various people, styles, and time periods, often with a negative connotation, implying a lack of sophistication compared to \"modern\" societal and literary advancements. The combination of the dramatic \"Gothic\" style with the novel's innovative format, which allows readers to directly experience the characters' psychology, has enabled the Gothic genre to remain relevant for a long time and to be perceived as both outdated and novel to readers separated from the original writing by time.\n\nOne of the key ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of chivalry. The medieval notion of chivalry, which emphasizes the development of a proper knight, is reinterpreted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry holds significance for Gothic writers due to its representation of the ideal knight: brave, honorable, and capable. Writers, particularly Walpole, were drawn to this ideal because they perceived a lack of it in their contemporary society. By incorporating chivalric concepts and values, the \"gothic past\" is romanticized and idealized, foreshadowing the evolution of Gothic into Romanticism, and used as a means to critique the present. Walpole, who wrote The Castle of Otranto during a tumultuous period in his life, amid political turmoil and unfair accusations, may have subconsciously felt that the perceived goodness and morality of the gothic era had been lost in his contemporaries. This sentiment is evident in the character of Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, such as being described as a prince who has suffered and is said to have been wronged by infidels. This portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is an exaggerated representation, introducing the tropes of excess that would become characteristic of the Gothic genre (66).",
            "Supply chain management encompasses a wide array of processes involved in getting goods from the initial customer order to the final delivery to the customer. The term was coined by Keith Oliver in 1982, a consultant who described the comprehensive process of planning, implementing, and controlling supply chain activities to meet customer needs efficiently and quickly. Effective supply chain management relies on six crucial elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers leverage these elements to deliver exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction is the foundation of the supply chain process, laying the groundwork for the entire sequence of events. To initiate production, managers must understand customer preferences, which can be gauged by analyzing market trends. By doing so, they can determine the products in demand, decide on production quantities, and select the optimal production location and facility to meet customer expectations for volume and quality. Every aspect of production, from scheduling workloads to equipment maintenance, is critical to the process's success. Inadequate planning can lead to wasted time and resources, as exemplified by large retailers like Wal-Mart and Target, which establish detailed processes and protocols for each aspect of their business.\n\nSupply is the second vital component of supply chain management, encompassing strategic decisions regarding a company's core capabilities and partnerships. This involves assessing the optimal distribution of production processes among various divisions, each with its own equipment, workforce, and specializations. Managers may choose to outsource certain tasks to other companies to enhance velocity – the ability to deliver high-quality products while maintaining low costs or reducing costs further. By making informed decisions about supply, companies can streamline their operations and better meet customer demands.",
            "Ellen Page, known for her role in the film Juno, holds a cardboard sign with an unsettling message in Burma, a country in Southeast Asia ruled by a ruthless military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup. The sign reads \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" In 2007, a series of protests broke out in the country, led by Burmese monks who wore saffron robes. These protests, known as the Saffron Revolution, initially sparked public interest and were allowed by the government. However, the situation soon escalated into violence, with the military invading and looting monasteries and foreign journalists being arrested and imprisoned. A Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed in September 2007 for covering the protests. While the official death toll is 13, Colonel Hla Win, a defected army colonel, claimed that the actual number of fatalities is much higher.\n\nThis phenomenon is not new. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain control over their populations. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine authority, while Japanese emperors were believed to be gods. Even in modern times, some leaders have engaged in similar behavior. For instance, the Chinese government responded to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests with a violent crackdown, resulting in a disputed death toll ranging from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide in the 1990s, carried out by Hutu militia groups and the Rwandan government, another example of systematic violence against a particular group. The Holocaust, led by Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, is another extreme example of government-sanctioned violence against a specific ethnicity.",
            "The enduring legacy of Duke Ellington in the realm of jazz is a direct result of his remarkable longevity and creative versatility. Although his piano presence may be subtle in many compositions, as a master composer, Ellington excelled at crafting intricate pieces that showcased the unique talents of each band member. By skillfully designing the framework for improvisation and writing tightly orchestrated passages that highlighted individual band styles, Ellington successfully created a cohesive and original sound for each piece. His deep understanding of the distinct sounds of his players and how they blended together to form a cohesive ensemble enabled him to compose some of the most innovative and groundbreaking pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative approach to music by mentioning Creole Love Call, which exemplifies his use of voice as a versatile instrument throughout his career. This early piece showcases his ability to incorporate voice as a sonic element without being bound by lyrics, adding texture and depth to his music. The structure of Creole Love Call, a slow twelve-bar blues piece with six distinct choruses, is a testament to Ellington's skill in complementing the unique styles of his soloists. The six choruses of Creole Love Call feature a range of musical elements, including a call-and-response pattern, a muted trumpet solo, a sweeping clarinet solo, and a climactic reed section.\n\nEllington's use of voice in Creole Love Call is just one example of his ability to introduce new dimensions of tone color to his music. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington demonstrates his mastery of orchestration and his ear for tone color by combining a call-and-response phrase between a muted trumpet and scat singing. This approach to music is further refined in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Ellington skillfully utilizes the unique sound of Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone to introduce the melody, creating a rich and complementary sound.",
            "She had always felt a persistent sense of longing, a desire that remained unfulfilled. This feeling started to manifest at the age of 14, as she began to navigate the challenges of adolescence. Three years later, at 17, she had come to realize that her desire wasn't for material possessions, but for a deeper connection with someone. However, she found herself disinterested in the boys around her, and despite some suitors' efforts to win her over, none of them truly resonated with her. She often struggled to understand the root of her feelings, and as the years went by, she considered various theories, but none seemed convincing enough to explain her situation. As a result, she continued to live life, grappling with her desires.\n\nLife at home was typically peaceful, thanks to her parents' calm demeanor. They rarely argued with each other, and even their conversations with her were infrequent. The only disagreements they had were about her strong sense of independence and free-spirited nature, which often contrasted with their more laid-back personalities. Her parents' even-tempered approach to life was an interesting contrast to her own lively personality, which made her all the more endearing to those around her.\n\nHowever, today was not a typical day. As she wandered from room to room, searching for inspiration, she heard a faint cry from the kitchen, followed by the sound of her mother's distressed voice. Rushing into the room, she grew anxious and frantically asked, \"Mom, what's wrong?!\" Upon seeing her mother lying on the ground, clutching her side in pain, she rushed to her side and tried to assist her. \"Ouch... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother managed to stammer between ragged breaths. Recognizing her mother's intense pain, she quickly offered to help, asking, \"Okay, Mom, where can you pick you up?\" Her mother pointed her in the right direction, and at that moment, her daughter felt grateful for the self-defense classes she had taken, which allowed her to lift and support her mother. She carefully placed her mother in the car and drove her to the hospital.\n\nUpon arriving at the hospital, the strong scent of disinfectant and the atmosphere of anxiety filled the air, but her daughter's focus remained on supporting her mother. She quickly brought her mother to the examination area and signaled for medical help. As the doctors and nurses gathered around, they quickly assessed her mother's condition and transferred her to a rolling bed. Her daughter was left to sit and worry, anxiously waiting for news about her mother's condition.\n\nIt turned out that her mother had slipped off a step stool while reaching for a vase on a high cabinet.",
            "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether adhering to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet) is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease and stroke, as well as stroke mortality. The study focused on a modified version of the Med diet, known as the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet,\" which emphasizes consuming more plant-based foods, including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, along with higher intakes of monounsaturated fats and fish, while minimizing animal products and saturated fats. The study also allowed for moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious studies had shown that adherence to a Med diet is associated with a lower risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, and that it is more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving cholesterol levels in obese individuals. However, previous research had not specifically examined the relationship between the Med diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study, which was part of the Nurses' Health Study, a large cohort study of female nurses in the US, followed 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 years without a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes. The researchers calculated an aMed diet score based on self-reported food frequency questionnaires completed six times between 1984 and 2004. The high participation rate of over 95% throughout the 20-year study period ensured the reliability of the data. The questionnaires were validated through medical records, autopsy, and death certificates, with cases of heart disease and stroke confirmed through review of these documents. Additional factors such as body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, and menopausal status were also accounted for.\n\nTo account for individual variations in dietary habits and better represent long-term dietary intake, the researchers calculated the cumulative average of the aMed score from the repeated questionnaires. They adjusted for potential confounding factors, including age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the study found that a higher aMed diet score was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke in women. Over a 20-year follow-up period, the researchers identified 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women with the highest aMed diet score had a lower risk of both heart disease and stroke compared to those with the lowest score, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "In 2007, the United States faced an severe economic downturn caused by a financial crisis that has persisted to this day. The aftermath of the crisis saw rising unemployment and a collapsed housing market, resulting in the downfall of numerous major corporations. In order to understand and prevent such events from recurring, it is essential to investigate the causes behind the crisis. Essentially, the crisis was triggered by reckless and ill-advised governmental decisions that forced banks and financial institutions to issue high-risk sub-prime loans to an already fragile financial structure. Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were compelled to purchase and repackage these sub-prime mortgages into complex financial instruments, such as CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks faced significant financial shortfalls, which were subsequently transferred to the repackaged mortgages and the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis date back to the late 1990s, during President Clinton's administration. In an attempt to secure re-election, the Clinton administration relaxed lending regulations, paving the way for the subsequent sub-prime crisis. As reported by Steven Holmes of the New York Times in 1999, Fannie Mae was under pressure from the government to increase mortgage lending to low-income households, while also facing pressure from shareholders to maintain its rapid growth in profits. Holmes' insightful commentary predicted that the government-backed corporation might encounter difficulties in case of an economic downturn, necessitating a government bailout akin to the one for the savings and loan industry in the 1980s. Unfortunately, his warning turned out to be prophetic, as the economy eventually experienced a catastrophic meltdown.\n\nA combination of factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the emergence of novel and complex mortgage products, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). The extensive use of these products led to increased interconnectedness of various sectors of the economy with the housing market, causing households and financial markets to become heavily leveraged and vulnerable to even minor price fluctuations. As a result, the housing bubble eventually burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities facing significant losses.\n\nThe extent of the crisis became apparent in 2007, when the top five U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, accounting for approximately 30% of the country's GDP. The crisis led to the collapse of Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch, while Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to transform into commercial banks subject to stringent regulations. Fannie and Freddie, burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "The infamous exposition - that part of the story where writers often struggle to strike the right balance between revealing essential information and overwhelming their readers. While it's meant to be an opportunity for creative expression, it can just as easily lead to eye-glazing passages that leave readers yawning or, worse still, hitting the \"Back\" button in frustration. Even seasoned writers like Dr. Merlin have been guilty of succumbing to the temptation of lengthy exposition, often with less-than-ideal results.\n\nExposition is a common pitfall that many writers face, despite being familiar with the fundamental principle, \"Show, don't tell.\" It's the internal voice that whispers to get necessary details out of the way, often disguising itself as efficiency. However, this \"devil on the shoulder\" can lead to dry, information-heavy passages that fail to engage readers.\n\nTo illustrate this point, consider a narrative where the author tells the reader about a character's entire history, including their meeting with their partner, their wedding, and the partner's tragic demise, all within a few lines of dialogue. This approach would likely fall flat, leaving the reader uninvested in the character's fate and lacking insight into their emotional depth. A more effective approach would be to gradually reveal the character's personality, background, and relationships through subtle actions, speech, and interactions, allowing the reader to form a genuine connection.\n\nFor instance, instead of being told that a character's husband loved them deeply, the reader should experience it through his words, mannerisms, and the heroine's reactions to him. This nuanced portrayal would make his eventual death more impactful and allow the reader to empathize with the heroine's emotional journey. By providing more depth to the story's surface-level narrative, writers can craft a richer, more engaging experience for their readers.\n\nAs a writer, it's essential to resist the temptation to rush through exposition, especially when introducing new characters or plot points. Even seemingly minor details, such as a character's past experiences or motivations, can be presented in a way that feels organic and engaging, rather than info-dumping. By doing so, writers can create a more immersive and memorable story that draws readers in and refuses to let go.",
            "I watched live news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, on August 13, 2011. The first newscast I viewed was from NBC 4 in the morning. The leading story reported on a shocking incident in Ashley, Ohio, where a man named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife, although her name was not revealed. The news segment showed his mug shot, and he appeared to exude an eerie aura. The story was covered for approximately two minutes as it was still developing. Given the circumstances, it seemed like an adequate amount of time was devoted to this story.\n\nThe second story concerned an early morning shooting in the Sharon Woods area, in which an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers was critically injured but no arrests had been made at the time. The SWAT team was investigating. This story seemed brief, and I suspect it might have been due to the fact that the victim was a minority and the incident occurred in a predominantly minority neighborhood. My observation over the years has been that minority victims of crime often receive less media attention compared to those from the majority group. \n\nThe next story reported on a gunshot hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were provided about the suspected location of the incident, and it was determined that a .22 caliber rifle bullet had struck the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers was offering a substantial reward for any information leading to the identification of the shooter.\n\nThe following story was about the impending rain and thunderstorms forecasted for Saturday afternoon. They predicted temperatures to remain in the mid-to-low eighties for the weekend. The segment was a bit concise, possibly intended to pique viewers' interest and encourage them to stay tuned.\n\nAdditionally, the news aired a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. According to reports, a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt robbed the store, described as being around six feet tall and weighing approximately 150 pounds. I found it peculiar that they gave an unusual amount of emphasis on his skin color and darkness.\n\nThe final story I viewed was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin, who had been found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. It was noted that he received a 300-month prison sentence instead of stating it as 25 years. I'm unsure if this phrasing was intended to convey a harsher punishment or simply to highlight the duration. The news also identified Rodriguez as a Hispanic man, but I don't believe this detail was pertinent to the story.",
            "There exists a profound bond between brothers, an unbreakable and irreversible connection that encompasses a wide range of complex emotions such as love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers possess a deep understanding of one another that surpasses their relationships with anyone else, often seeing themselves reflected in their sibling. In times of crisis, the true essence of this bond is revealed, whether it is characterized by positivity or negativity. The consequences of these emotions can be far-reaching and often come at a great cost. To comprehend the emotions stemming from this fraternal connection, one must also consider the repercussions that accompany them. When an individual can look into their brother's eyes and see their own reflection, they gain insight into their true character, which is often revealed through their actions and the outcomes of those actions. The novel \"The Scarlet Ibis\" explores this theme through the tumultuous relationship between two brothers, their intense emotions, and the vivid description of their surroundings. \n\nThe protagonist's actions are primarily driven by one dominating emotion: pride. From their initial journey together to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist harbors resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle. The protagonist had envisioned a brother who could participate in various activities and share in his experiences, such as exploring the outdoors and engaging in physical activities. However, Doodle's congenital heart condition made it highly unlikely that he would be able to participate in these activities, shattering the protagonist's dreams. The protagonist even harbors anger towards Doodle, as evidenced by his thoughts of harming him. Nevertheless, the child's smile brings out a deep-seated love within the protagonist, indicating that his feelings for his brother were not as superficial as they initially seemed. This internal conflict highlights the complexities of the bond between brothers and the various emotions that arise from it.",
            "The human brain is an intricate and innovative processing system that handles vast amounts of information. Over time, as technology has evolved, so have the metaphors used to describe the brain. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. It's essential to remember that these metaphors are limited and may lead to misconceptions when trying to understand the brain's workings.\n\nThe processing of information begins with sensory organs transforming physical stimuli, such as touch, temperature, sound waves, or light, into electrochemical signals. These sensory inputs are then repeatedly processed by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing methods. For instance, when viewing a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles basic information like color, orientation, and border details to identify the object as a box. Top-down processing, on the other hand, uses previously made decisions to expedite recognition of the object, potentially identifying it as a black box rather than a hole in the background.\n\nOnce the processing reaches a certain level, an attention filter determines the signal's importance and allocates it to the relevant cognitive processes. Although the brain processes every detail when looking at the grass near your shoes, a healthy filter prevents you from consciously perceiving each blade individually. Conversely, you might focus on your name even when spoken in a noisy environment. This cycle of processing and filtering occurs repeatedly and involves multiple stages.\n\nBefore the brain can process information, it must first store it. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, and the method of encoding varies depending on the type of sensory stimulus. For example, verbal input can be encoded according to its visual appearance, its sound, or its meaning. Once stored, information needs to be maintained. Research on animals suggests that working memory, which retains information for about 20 seconds, is sustained through temporary electrical signals passed through specific neurons. Long-term memory is believed to be sustained through the structure of particular types of proteins.\n\nThere are numerous theories on how knowledge is organized within the brain, each based on different approaches such as memory recall, computer science, or neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that there are nodes representing concepts and that these nodes are connected based on their relevance. For instance, in a semantic network, the concept of a \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the looming threats of technology and capitalism in his dystopian novel Brave New World, where individuals prioritize the collective over the individual and are conditioned to crave instant gratification above all else. The citizens are portrayed as mere pawns in a larger game, conditioned to conform to a single ideology dictated by the all-powerful World Controller. Analyzing the work through a Marxist lens reveals Huxley's underlying concerns about the development of these systems. The novel's use of Marxist terminology, such as homogenization and reification, reinforces the idea that Huxley is cautioning against the flaws in the emerging economic systems of his time.\n\nThe novel satirizes capitalism by employing the concept of false consciousness, which suggests that the common masses are unaware of their true relationships with other economic classes due to ideological control. The lower classes, like the Deltas and Gammas, are conditioned to prioritize consumption, spending, and indulgence through hypnopædia, while the upper classes, such as the Alphas and Betas, are born with the privilege of awareness but often fail to challenge the status quo. The novel portrays a society where the lower classes are oblivious to their manipulation, perpetuating a system that serves the interests of the ruling elite. The interactions between individuals in Brave New World are superficial, lacking depth and genuine connections, suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism stifles human free will and emotional expression. The characters' complacency with their assigned roles in the hierarchy and their absolute obedience to the community reflect Marxist ideas about the exploited proletariat, who are led to believe in their own superiority as long as they conform to the norms of consumerism and obedience.\n\nRelationships between individuals are nonexistent in Brave New World, and the novel's portrayal of interactions highlights the dehumanizing effects of capitalism. The characters' limited emotional ranges and shallow conversations, often focused on physical appearances, illustrate the ways in which capitalism reduces individuals to mere commodities. The novel's depiction of a society where people are willing to conform to their predetermined roles and accept their place in the hierarchy is a commentary on the oppressive nature of capitalism and the ways in which it erodes human consciousness and relationships.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for approximately two and a half years, which is equivalent to four and a half semesters. For many of my peers and myself, navigating the campus is often a challenge. During my freshman year, I was accommodated in an East Halls dorm, situated near the eastern edge of the campus, excluding the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. The distance between my home in Stuart Hall and my classes in the Willard building, which is centrally located, could take up to 25 minutes to cover on foot, especially during inclement weather, which is common in State College. Upon conversing with an alumnus roughly my age, I discovered that the East Halls dorms were previously isolated from the rest of the campus by vast empty spaces. However, these areas have since been transformed into sports facilities, state-of-the-art buildings such as the new Creamery and health services building, and surrounded by apartments. As the campus continues to expand, the issue of mobility becomes increasingly pressing. In this context, the most effective solution is undoubtedly cycling. Nonetheless, owning a bike is not enough; students need to actively use them, and the campus infrastructure must be designed with the needs of cyclists in mind.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who had resumed cycling after a several-year break. He expressed his surprise at why he had ever stopped, saying, \"Bikes are fantastic, they were only considered uncool for a few years, but they're the best way to get around.\" Cycling not only provides a physical workout but is also the most efficient mode of transportation. Combining a healthy breakfast with moderate exercise can cover considerable distances, such as 30 miles or more. As many undergraduates do, I now reside off-campus, at a similar distance from the campus center as some dorms. This academic year, the most intelligent decision I made was purchasing a bike. Every day, I attend classes in Thomas building, which is approximately a 25-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike significantly reduces this time to just 5 minutes if I pedal at a decent pace. Nevertheless, Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my residence, but it's not always a straightforward road to travel on, whether I'm on a bike or not. While walking has its advantages, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn't own a bike, walking would be my only reliable means of transportation to class, which would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day. This translates to over 2.5 hours every week, not to mention the additional time spent walking to other classes, appointments, and various other activities. This is more time than I can afford to spare."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "My goal is to pursue a career with the Division of Family and Children Services to make a positive impact on the lives of children who have been abused or neglected, and to provide support to struggling families. As a future social worker, I will uphold the core values of service, respect, and a commitment to improving relationships and personal growth, ensuring I remain proficient in my field. These values not only resonate with the social work profession but also deeply personal to me.\n\nThroughout my educational journey, I have always been driven to help others, but I struggled to identify a specific career path. During my time in high school and college, I witnessed individuals confronting their problems with denial or unhealthy coping mechanisms. The situations I encountered motivated me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, as I sought a deeper understanding of human behavior. Although I still felt uncertain about my career path after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, a life-changing experience that summer opened my eyes to the need for social work professionals. A friend introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was struggling with abuse at home, and I soon discovered that he had turned to the authorities for help. As I learned more about the situation, I realized the gravity of the issue and the importance of supporting vulnerable children. I decided to visit the boy's parents, where I expressed my concerns to the police and shared my recent graduation from Piedmont College. Although the law couldn't intervene, I was able to speak with the parents, and their dismissive attitude towards their son's situation only strengthened my resolve to pursue a career in social work.\n\nAnother essential value for social work professionals is advocating for social justice. Our society often touts the importance of individuality, yet we often conform to traditional norms rather than embracing our true uniqueness. I believe that if we value individuality, we should not be afraid to stand out from the crowd. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively challenged social injustice, expressing myself through bold fashion choices, public declarations of support for marginalized groups, and standing up against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it. As a future social worker, I will continue to fight for social justice and advocate for those who are marginalized or oppressed.",
            "This paper delves into the relationship between biological and sociocultural models as they relate to insomnia, a prevalent sleep disorder. The biological model examines the role of genetic factors and medical health aspects in the development of insomnia, while the sociocultural model explores the impact of environmental factors, including demographics, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity. This review aims to analyze and critique existing research related to these models, focusing on their strengths and limitations.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to mental health conditions, and sleep disorders resulting from medical complications or substance use. Primary sleep disorders, such as Dyssonmias and Parasomnias, encompass various subcategories, including Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and others. Insomnia can manifest as difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep, while Hypersomnia involves excessive daytime sleepiness. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are characterized by behavioral and physiological anomalies during sleep. This review primarily focuses on insomnia and its connection to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders highlights the significance of genetic and physiological factors, including the role of neurons in the hypothalamus that regulate sleep and wakefulness. Research on mice has demonstrated that GABAB receptors in these neurons play a crucial role in sleep-wake states. The activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and improved sleep quality. Studies have shown that GABAB agonists, such as baclofen, can increase sleep duration, suggesting a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. This research implies that genetic factors can influence sleep patterns, and alterations in the receptor could lead to sleep disturbances. The sociocultural implications of this study suggest that inherited phenotypes can regulate sleep, and disruptions to the receptor could have a negative impact on daily life, affecting aspects such as education, career, and daily tasks that require focus and attention.",
            "This paper covers three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it offers a concise explanation of the condition. Next, it delves into the diagnosis process, highlighting common warning signs or characteristics associated with CAPD. Finally, the paper concludes with strategies for a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom setting to support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to how efficiently the brain processes auditory information. Essentially, it is a disorder where the brain fails to correctly interpret sounds it receives. People with CAPD can hear normally but struggle to distinguish words, separate conversations from background noise, and differentiate between various sounds due to a problem with the brain's auditory processing mechanisms.\n\nThe earliest documented references to CAPD date back to the mid-1950s, when researchers described it as \"auditory imperception.\" In the 1950s and 1960s, researchers like Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari developed tests to assess children with communication disorders, while Kimura introduced dichotic testing in 1961 to study the brain's auditory processing mechanisms. A national conference in 1977 sparked further research on CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD presents itself in various ways, such as difficulty localizing sounds in space, distinguishing between multiple sounds, recognizing sound patterns, detecting changes in speech, and integrating sounds to form meaningful information. Individuals with CAPD may struggle to filter out background noise, interpret the sequence of auditory information, and respond to auditory clues.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, healthcare professionals use a combination of observational techniques and tests that assess auditory skills, including questionnaires, surveys, and behavioral observations. These tests often involve presenting patients with multiple auditory stimuli and asking them to differentiate between specific items. While there is no single, universally effective diagnostic tool, advanced tests may involve recording auditory signals and measuring the brain's responses.",
            "Twelfth Night suggests that while disguises can be useful for carrying out deceptions, ultimately, a person must choose to shed their disguise or risk losing their true identity in the process. However, this decision comes with a significant challenge: one may end up alienating themselves from others as a result. It boils down to a difficult choice between preserving one's own identity and maintaining relationships with those around them, as some might react neutrally to being deceived, while others may be offended by the deception. \n\nThe exploration of deception through gender role reversal in the play raises further complexities, particularly the underlying reasons behind a character's decision to adopt a disguise. In the case of Viola, her decision to impersonate a man is motivated by self-preservation, as seen in her statement about seeking protection in a foreign land. Although her plan is initially successful, it leads to her isolation from the women around her and creates complications in her relationships with others, such as Olivia, who mistakes her for her twin brother Sebastian, and Orsino, with whom she develops unrequited romantic feelings.\n\nThe play also touches on the idea that deception can facilitate the expression of suppressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages imply that these characters may have unacknowledged desires that are triggered by Viola's disguise. For instance, is Olivia genuinely attracted to Cesario, or is she driven by a fascination with masculinity? The ease with which she switches her affections from Cesario to Sebastian suggests that Olivia might be parodying the superficial judgments of her time, rather than genuinely harboring feelings for women. \n\nThis is evident in her later shift in attitude towards Cesario/Viola, where she no longer views her as a romantic interest but rather as a family member, as seen in her comment, \"A sister, you are she.\"",
            "The brutality of German colonial rule, particularly in the context of the genocide against the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa, has been widely noted by observers. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the German colonial empire was multifaceted, with varied policies, ruling styles, and geographies, making a single description inadequate. Despite this complexity, the German colonial empire's educational systems showed significant diversity. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a well-educated and literate African population. Similarly, German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies received praise from contemporary authors. \n\nIn stark contrast, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast, with the government largely delegating the responsibility of native education to missionary societies that received limited government support. Conversely, the government invested considerable resources in the education of Europeans, establishing state schools and heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, persisting even after the end of German rule. Unlike other German colonies, where a significant number of Africans were literate and educated, in South West Africa, the vast majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate. Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience, and this study aims to further explore these factors by examining new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is an extensive body of literature examining education in the German colonial empire, primarily written in German during the early 20th century. Early works focused on describing the characteristics of educational systems in these colonies. Later studies, written in English, expanded the discourse by conducting comparative studies of education in various German colonies and providing in-depth analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. One notable study, conducted by Cohen, compares the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa, discussing the factors that contributed to the disparities between them. According to Cohen, the presence of a large settler population in South West Africa was a key factor in shaping the colony's educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonies, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, despite a significant portion of the territory being arid desert. This relatively favorable climate led to a substantial European population in South West Africa, with approximately 15,000 whites residing there by 1913, compared to only 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The classification of popular music has become increasingly complex over the past century, with numerous genres emerging that it is challenging to comprehensively list them all. Furthermore, most notable genres, such as rock, jazz, country, and folk, have branched out into various sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, making the classification even more intricate. Heavy Metal, a sub-genre of rock music, has particularly grown to be one of the most diverse and expressive genres in the past four decades. It is characterized by its wide range of emotions, predominantly leaning towards the darker end of the spectrum. The genre's diversity stems from its early adaptability, which allowed artists to create their own sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, resulting in a continuous chain of new variations.\n\nToday, the heavy metal movement has expanded to the point where it is challenging to define what constitutes heavy metal music. It has incorporated numerous themes from other genres, but its origins can be traced back to a specific starting point. To fully grasp the extent of metal music today, it is essential to understand the underlying principles and motivations behind the metal movement.\n\nHeavy metal music can be described as a movement that embodies darkness, often characterized by increased intensity, volume, and theatricality. It is often associated with musicians who possess exceptional technical skills and musical proficiency, which is reflected in their music. Additionally, the genre has been influenced by the use of psychedelic substances in the 1970s, which led to the creation of innovative and otherworldly music. The genre's dark, visceral qualities departed from the more conventional emotional ranges of popular music at the time. Later generations of metal musicians drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's dark and intense qualities, as evident in the lyrics of various metal songs. For instance, the lyrics from Helter Skelter, a song by the Beatles, display the darker side of their music, which was a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier and darker song. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate their ability to produce heavy music, which they showcased on their album The White Album.",
            "Long before the Surrealist artists brought their dreamlike paintings to the scene, Henri Rousseau was shaping his own dream, literally and figuratively, with his brush. In \"The Dream,\" a 1910 Post-Impressionist masterpiece, we see not only a woman marveling at the wonders of a fantastical land but also Rousseau's own aspirations as an artist. For years, he longed for the recognition, approval, and admiration of his peers, yet struggled with an internal conflict that defined his career: the desire to conform to established art styles to gain acceptance, versus the need to stay true to his unique creative voice. His painting, \"The Dream,\" embodies this lifelong inner turmoil.\n\nTo truly understand Rousseau's motivations, it's essential to delve into his background. Born in Laval, northwest France, on May 21, 1844, Henri Rousseau came from a relatively affluent family. Despite this comfort, he received no formal art training and instead worked as a gabelou for the municipal toll service in France until the age of 40. Although he was called a customs inspector, his true passion remained painting, which he turned to as a source of solace after the tragic loss of his wife and eight children left him with only one daughter, Julia. Rousseau's work differs from that of his contemporaries, who romanticized peasants, as he sought to represent the everyday life and aspirations of the common man.\n\nGiven his circumstances, Rousseau's yearning for recognition in the art world is understandable. He began painting at an older age, with little education in formal art techniques, and produced works alongside more renowned artists of the time. It wasn't until around the same period when Matisse was establishing himself as an artist that Rousseau finally received the recognition he deserved. Jan Gordon notes in his book \"Modern French Painters\" that while Matisse and Rousseau were competitors in the art world, their motivations differed: Matisse sought to avoid clichés, whereas Rousseau aimed to create something conventional enough to be accepted by the prestigious Artiste Français.",
            "Many influential thinkers have long proposed a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, suggesting that truth and beauty are intertwined. I believe that there's a fundamental reason for this. John Keats' famous quote from \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" - \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know\" - hints at this connection. While our understanding of the world often comes from education and experience, we seem to intuitively appreciate ethics and aesthetics without needing to be taught. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to explain and describe rather than dictate rules, seeking to understand why certain actions are moral or why specific works of art are beautiful. \n\nCriticism and analysis of art or morality can never fully grasp the essence of what makes something good or beautiful. When discussing the value of a piece like da Vinci's Mona Lisa, we might focus on aspects like composition, context, or cultural significance, but these elements don't capture the underlying reason why it's considered great art. People often find it difficult to put into words why they adore a particular work of art, and instead say something like \"there's just something about it.\" Similarly, Flannery O'Connor noted that a story can convey something that cannot be expressed in any other way. No matter how thoroughly we analyze a work of literature, there's always an intangible, transcendent quality that remains unexplained. I propose that ethics shares this same property, as suggested by Ludwig Wittgenstein's statement that ethics cannot be fully expressed. This elusive, unexplainable aspect is the most powerful attribute of both art and morality, and it's what connects them. \n\nBecause both art and ethics touch us at a fundamental, experiential level that's difficult to put into words, they're closely linked. This connection is particularly strong when it comes to literature, as McKean pointed out, \"Literature is unique among the arts in its moral quality.\" While moral standards may not be relevant to other art forms like music, they're deeply relevant to literature and to life itself. As living beings, we're driven by values, and literature's importance stems from the values we find within it.",
            "Germany is currently a unified country with a distinct culture that spans from the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea in Kiel, as well as from Cologne on the Rhine River to Dresden on the Elbe River. This unique blend of culture is a result of the country's diverse history and the various tribes that shaped it. Germania, the ancestral homeland of the Germans, has a disputed etymology. Scholars and historians disagree on the origins of the name, with some attributing it to the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe mentioned by the Roman historian Tacitus. He noted that they were previously known as Germans before crossing the Rhine River and battling the Gauls.\n\nThe Roman leader Julius Caesar is credited with first using the term \"Germanus\" in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, which he used to distinguish between the Gauls and the Germanic tribes he encountered. However, the meaning of the term is unclear, with some believing it referred to a neighboring tribe in the Gaulish language, while others suggest it may have come from the word \"ger,\" a type of spear used in warfare. Another theory suggests that it may be derived from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were known for their loud and noisy nature.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote in his book \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" that the Germans were aboriginal and had not been influenced by other cultures through immigration or trade. He noted that the harsh climate, rugged country, and unfriendly demeanor of Germany would make it an unappealing destination for outsiders, and that the Romans would only send expeditions to Germania for trade and conquest, but would ultimately return to their empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the fringes of the Roman Empire, trading goods and skills with the Romans in exchange for their military service.",
            "I stood gazing down, my mind blank and taking in the scene before me without any emotional attachment. My thoughts were fleeting and unconnected, slipping in and out of my consciousness like ripples on a smooth lake. My perception of the world seemed effortless and fluid, as if I was merely observing without any personal thoughts or biases.\n\nEarlier, I had attempted to tap into my creative side by following the advice of an artist I worked with, who recommended the book \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had always been fascinated by drawing and this book provided a comprehensive guide, covering even the basics such as understanding the properties of a pencil and the brain's processes for interpreting lines. One technique from the book that stuck with me was the idea of framing a subject within a square, simplifying complex scenes into more manageable compositions. However, at that moment, I found it impossible to mentally impose such a frame on the present scene. The messy, overwhelming sight before me left me awestruck, and I stood frozen in wonder.\n\nAs I thought about it, I realized that I was standing in the midst of creating my own art piece, or at least, the beginning of one. Like the masters who influenced me – Picasso's blue period, Monet's love of greenery, or the Renaissance masters' vibrant palette – I too had a unique perspective to contribute. I had a vision, and the tools to bring it to life. With a surge of inspiration, my hand instinctively reached for the pencil, and my fingers began to move with a life of their own, bringing my vision into being.\n\nHowever, my creative moment was short-lived. My hand jerked and spasmed as I tried to dislodge the clogged toilet, and I was left staring at the stubborn brown mass that refused to budge. Clutching the mop, I stood frozen, my green tie constricting my neck, and my expression turned sour as I gazed at the unwanted surprise left by someone else. After a few tense moments, I stooped to grab the toilet paper and wrapped it around my hand like a protective glove, before plunging it into the toilet bowl with a sense of trepidation. The task was far from elegant, but it was a necessary one, and I proceeded with a mix of reluctance and duty.",
            "Teen drivers are facing a high risk of accidents, leading to tragic outcomes. Several interrelated factors contribute to this alarming trend among young American drivers. According to the National Institutes of Health, the primary issue lies in the fact that the teenage brain is still developing and not fully equipped to handle the dangers associated with driving. This inexperience not only results in a higher number of fatal crashes but also increases the likelihood of rollover accidents, speeding, and driving off the road. Moreover, when teens drive with their peers, the risk of accidents significantly escalates, as a study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a direct correlation between passenger age and the frequency of traffic accidents.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, California and other states have implemented temporary provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit minors from riding with teen drivers. However, these measures are only temporary solutions to a deeper problem. As a group, young drivers are, statistically speaking, unable to effectively manage the risks and responsibilities associated with driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman suggests that 18 is too young for a full driver's license, citing research that highlights a common desire among those under 19-20 to engage in thrill-seeking behavior. Delaying driving until this tendency has diminished is, therefore, a sensible approach. Continuing to issue licenses to young teens will only lead to more deadly crashes and a substantial increase in the death toll in the coming years. With millions of new teen drivers expected to hit the road by 2010, the need for effective legislation becomes increasingly pressing.\n\nImplementing legislation to address this issue is a relatively straightforward process. Schools can continue to provide driver's education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 should be allowed to operate a vehicle. A provisional permit can still be issued before a full license is granted, and a set number of practical driving hours can be required. The number of hours could be based on the existing requirements in most states, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice. A national, uniform approach to this issue would be a reasonable and effective means of protecting teen drivers across the country. The proposed legislation is not a new concept, but it is a necessary step towards reducing the alarming statistics surrounding teen drivers.",
            "While reviewing the early Edison films housed in the Library of Congress, I opted to examine the entire collection of trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. There were a total of fifteen films, which largely utilized creative editing techniques to create illusions. My study primarily focused on analyzing the aesthetic principles behind most of these trick films and identifying the distinct features that emerged in some of the later ones. The early trick films, which were produced at the turn of the century, were primarily set-bound, featuring static compositions, a static camera, and adherence to the rule of using one shot per film. However, a few films from the beginning of the 20th century began to deviate from these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne of the defining characteristics of trick films is their use of an interior set within a frontal proscenium, which was a common feature in both early cinema and vaudeville and magic performances. The camera remained stationary, following neither the movement of characters nor objects. This composition was inspired by the theatrical and vaudeville traditions. As a result, characters in these films often moved horizontally, rarely moving towards or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors entered from the right side, moving left and right within the frame. Even when they exited, the camera did not track their movement.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition also led to the use of long and medium shots, with close-ups being extremely rare in trick films. This stylistic choice was influenced by the theatrical and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance, framed within the stage borders. In these early films, actors typically remained in the middle ground and did not move towards the camera, making close-ups impossible. The majority of trick films followed the rule of one conceptual shot per film, limiting their length to around a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This constraint also restricted the narrative and dramatic potential of these films, with most focusing on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic and illusions. Notably, however, a single shot may consist of multiple joined physical shots, used to create the illusion of disappearance or apparition, as seen in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). A closer examination of this film reveals the moment when the physical shot of Mary's severed head begins, even though the entire film is perceived as a single shot by the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a strong advocate for Republicanism in its early stages. As an agriculturalist and briefly involved in politics, he became known for his unwavering dedication to individual liberties and government accountability. His agricultural background significantly influenced his views on governance, with his commitment to a rural way of life forming the foundation of his opinions on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to establish an ideal system of self-governance, free from the constraints of native traditions. He firmly believed in the importance of natural human rights, which he considered interconnected and equally essential. In his opinion, denying one right would undermine the value of all others, and governments should not interfere with these inalienable rights. Taylor equated the concept of the \"state of nature\" with the idea that those with physical strength and malicious intentions often held power, but he argued that in a civilized society, this should not be the case.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor thought that the government should acknowledge the inherent duality of human nature, encompassing both good and evil. He was unyielding in his belief in a dualistic morality, stating that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" Taylor defined good principles as those that safeguard private property, promote agriculture, and discourage capitalist exploitation. He believed that a government founded on these principles would function fairly, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by self-interest and avarice. Taylor recognized self-interest as a fundamental human motivation, but only considered it detrimental when it led to the creation of sub-groups that exploited others at the expense of the community. A well-designed government was necessary to balance humanity's natural flaws and prevent the introduction of adverse principles.\n\nLike many staunch Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, with a minimalist Federal government possessing only explicitly stated rights and powers. He was aware that an extensive Federal government would be costly and potentially tyrannical. However, he also recognized the dangers of a simplistic, literal interpretation, which could become corrupted without considering the original intent of the Constitution's authors. Furthermore, Taylor regarded the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it explicitly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking at Figure 17, we can see that there was a significant decline in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was a cause for concern, and pinpointing the reason behind it is challenging. The onset of winter on a New England campus undoubtedly led to a decrease in foot and bicycle traffic, which might have contributed to the decline. The end of the fall semester in December, when students were busy with coursework, assessments, and other tasks, could also have pushed the commuter log to the back burner for many individuals. Furthermore, the holiday season in December brought a longer break for students and faculty, reducing the need for campus visits. The low log submissions in January might be attributed to the preceding break. However, the persistently low numbers in February remain unexplained. It's possible that projects like this one experience an initial surge of enthusiasm, followed by a natural decline in engagement. To counter this trend, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week, a targeted campaign in March that succeeded in boosting log submissions for that month. One of the key challenges we faced was maintaining momentum despite the natural decrease in engagement and the unique challenges posed by academic breaks. \n\nAnother hurdle for this project is the cultural preference for driving a car, which offers a sense of freedom, independence, and flexibility. To overcome this, we needed to offer incentives for alternative modes of transportation. We provided gift cards to local businesses, including restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores, in an attempt to encourage participation. It would have been interesting to see how larger prizes, such as a bicycle or electric car, could have impacted engagement. Increasing the value of prizes over time might have been more effective in sustaining interest. While the initial gift cards were sufficient at the start, announcing larger prizes in subsequent months could have reversed the decline in participation.",
            "An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that tracks an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets akin to an index fund, but offers more flexibility and trades on an exchange like a stock. By investing in an ETF, you can reap the benefits of diversification, similar to an index fund, along with the advantages of owning individual stocks, such as the ability to short sell, buy on margin, and purchase as few shares as one in any transaction. Although these benefits are highly appealing, ETFs typically come with lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund. However, there are drawbacks to consider, including the commission fees associated with buying and selling ETFs, similar to those charged for stock transactions. Furthermore, ETFs offer a wide range of investment options. It is essential for savvy financial investors to critically evaluate the actual benefits, such as diversification, and their extent before investing. For this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to determine if the benefits of owning a single ETF match the advantages of a diversified portfolio of the same stocks and whether there are better configurations of the same stocks that would yield a more optimal risk-return profile.\n\nTo simplify the evaluation process, we have chosen to focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. Below is a list of the top 10 holdings and their corresponding percentage of total assets.\n\nTo gauge how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, to estimate the contribution of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consisted entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF's holdings. The calculations of Beta and Return are presented in the chart below.\n\nAs shown in the chart, a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings would yield a Return that is 6.11% higher than the ETF's Return, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF. From the results obtained so far, it appears that a portfolio consisting of just the top 10 holdings may offer higher returns with lower risk. However, it is possible that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different.\n\nTo further assess whether these portfolios are statistically different, we calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% for comparison with the ETF IHF's standard deviation.",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is one of Edgar Allan Poe's most notable poems, which heavily employs the term \"Thulé\" – a concept initially linked to Virgil's work. Virgil used this term to refer to an island north of Britain, which the ancient Greeks viewed as the edge of the known world. However, it's essential to acknowledge a more contemporary source that influenced Poe's use of this term. Poe was deeply interested in the works of German authors, particularly Goethe, whose writing often resonated with him.\n\nThe significance of this reference lies in its demonstration of Poe's familiarity with Goethe's works. Karl J. Arndt's book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\" points out the striking similarities between their poems, suggesting that Poe may have been inspired by Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts, with the second installment appearing in 1832, the year of his death. Within \"Faust,\" there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells the story of a king who becomes consumed by grief after his wife's passing and ultimately dies. The King of Thulé's character shares eerie similarities with the figure in \"Dream-Land,\" possibly serving as a dark parallel to Poe's own struggles with loss and addiction. Another adaptation of \"Faust\" was created by H. P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe's use of the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe referenced Thule twice in his writings, using the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land\" as its bookends. Reading \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" together reveals a striking connection between the two works. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a desolate landscape of Thule, haunted by deceased friends, and a world devoid of color. These scenes mirror the King of Thule's emotional state in Goethe's poem, where the king is overcome with grief and loneliness after his wife's passing, leading him to lose interest in ruling and living. This parallel between the two poems suggests that Poe drew inspiration from Goethe's work, as if he had stepped into Goethe's poem.\n\nAs a prominent author, Goethe was well-known and respected by Poe, in part due to his admiration for Tennyson. Additionally, since Poe was exposed to Goethe's work through various reproductions and adaptations that followed the original publication, it is likely that Poe was familiar with Goethe's writing even if not directly influenced by Tennyson's connection to him.",
            "To determine whether a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a California grocery store could recover punitive damages, the court would evaluate if the store manager's actions demonstrated a reckless disregard for potential harm. A customer, Jennifer Palmer, may have a valid claim if she can prove that the store manager, Paul Martin, was informed of the spill twice but deliberately chose not to address it for 30 minutes while he ate dinner. \n\nA judge is unlikely to dismiss Palmer's punitive damage claim without a proper review. To justify punitive damages, Palmer must provide evidence that Martin's actions were taken with a deliberate intent to disregard the probable harm caused by the spill, and that his conduct was also despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have anticipated the potential harm of the spill, given that several customers had slipped and fallen in the same store in the preceding months. \n\nAlthough Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable may not be strongly supported, it is still a reasonable claim considering that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009 and Martin failed to take necessary safety precautions. \n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, informed Martin about the applesauce spill; however, Martin responded that he was on dinner break and couldn't handle customer complaints. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin of the spill, but he gave the same response. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious injury. Before Palmer's accident, five slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D Markets in 2009.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of duty not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Under the California Civil Code, malice is defined as conduct intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" \n\nCourts have found conduct to be malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, especially when the defendant was aware of the probable consequences of their actions and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.",
            "It has been almost four years since I took a course in Islam at CBC, where a crucial topic of discussion was whether Islam is a hostile religion. The issue remains just as relevant today as it was back then, especially when looking at the events since 9/11. The media's perception of Islam has shifted dramatically from being hostile towards extremists to being overly tolerant in the US, and I believe this trend is a significant change. Considering the 2001 presidential election, it's unlikely that a candidate like Barack Obama, who has a clear Muslim background in his family, could have been a contender back then.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography has always fascinated me because it seems to contradict the common perception of his personality. Based on my understanding of history, I thought Muhammad was known for forcing conversions to Islam, conquering tribes, and imposing his faith on them. However, the biography portrays him as a misunderstood leader who was humble and self-effacing, which is quite different from what I initially knew. It describes how people gradually came to accept his teachings after witnessing his humility and kindness.\n\nInterestingly, there are some intriguing similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the miraculous events attributed to Muhammad. One such example is when he multiplied food to feed a large group of people. The way the story is written makes me think that the authors aimed to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, but simply lived a life of truth and performed miracles. This approach downplays the significance of Jesus Christ's life and miracles, and I find it problematic as it appears to be an attempt to borrow from Jesus' narrative.\n\nThe biography also includes many stories that seem to serve as proof of people's personal experiences of converting to Islam. However, these stories are often based on third-party accounts, which makes me skeptical. I believe that presenting these stories in this manner diminishes their credibility and raises more questions about their authenticity.\n\nWhat bothers me most about the biography is the way it portrays Muhammad as a godly, humble, endearing, wise, and gentle figure. However, historical records contradict this image of Muhammad, and I often wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true circumstances surrounding his rise to power.",
            "Christian thought rapidly diverged from its original teachings and principles after Jesus' death, and over time, a significant movement away from its core values became apparent.  However, as societal awareness and progressive thinking continue to grow, there's a prospect that Christians will return to their faith's authentic roots.  As people become more aware of the history of their faith, they will begin to distinguish between the original teachings of Jesus and the additional doctrines that were introduced over time.  This process will likely take several decades or even centuries, but it is inevitable.  Ultimately, the result will be a shift towards a return to the original form of Christianity, stripping away layers of accumulated doctrine.  As this trend gains momentum, particularly in the US and Europe, it will lead to a more uniform understanding and practice of the faith, reducing the current diversity of beliefs and denominations.  History has shown us that reversals of this nature are possible, such as the fall of Christianity from being persecuted to becoming the dominant institution in the Roman Empire, and the transition from slavery to equality for African-Americans.  A reversal of this kind is also anticipated in the Christian faith, which will involve seeking the sources of the religion and reducing diversity in the process.  To facilitate this, it is crucial to interpret Jesus' words metaphorically rather than literally.  By looking back into history, we find that the Jewish faith, which is the basis of Christianity, was already present before the Roman Empire's rule in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish community was initially united, but later divided into different groups such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people, showcasing a lack of unity among them.",
            "The Jungle by Upton Sinclair vividly portrays the inherent selfishness and self-centered nature of humanity. People are primarily motivated by their desire to improve their own lives and circumstances, disregarding the well-being of those below them in the social hierarchy. This is exemplified through the character of the factory owners and managers. Their sole focus is on expanding their businesses and increasing their wealth, disregarding the harm caused to the environment and the people who suffer as a result. Sinclair uses descriptive language, such as the image of factory chimneys releasing smoke into the air, to illustrate the detrimental impact of their actions. The owners and managers show a blatant disregard for their employees, treating them as nothing more than a means to an end. They prioritize profits over people, forcing their workers to toil in hazardous conditions and terminate them without warning or compensation. The era in which the novel is set lacked regulations to protect workers' rights, allowing the factory owners to exploit their employees. The working-class people in Packingtown were essentially trapped, with no access to resources or support to help them escape their plight. The absence of effective aid and the prevalence of corrupt unions only exacerbated their struggles, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation. The novel describes the workers as being in a state of servitude, highlighting the inevitability and prevalence of immorality in such a system.",
            "Several authors employ various techniques to evoke a particular emotion or perspective in their readers. Some methods are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald exemplifies this by utilizing various techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. One of these techniques involves pairing an adjective with an unrelated noun to create a distinct atmosphere around a subject. Alternatively, he assigns significance to a symbol and later uses it to convey a particular feeling. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald uses this technique with colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink, giving them specific meanings. By doing so, he creates an association between these colors and a particular atmosphere in the novel.\n\nFitzgerald develops and applies the meaning of white/gray, which represents uniformity. He portrays white as representing refinement and high social status, while gray signifies age and dullness. At the beginning of the novel, Fitzgerald frequently uses both colors to establish this meaning. For instance, Daisy and Jordan are often depicted wearing white, and this is not unique to them; Nick also wears white flannels to Gatsby's party, while Tom wears a white shirt when meeting Myrtle. The only time white is absent is when Nick describes his initial impressions of Gatsby's party, where the halls are painted with primary colors. Fitzgerald further reinforces these colors by applying them to ordinary, insignificant subjects, such as the white chasms of lower New York and gray names on Nick's schedule. He also uses white and gray to describe common, unremarkable people or places, like the \"white girlhood\" Daisy and Jordan shared, the \"gray cars and gray land\" in the valley of ashes, and the \"gray old man\" selling dogs. After establishing the meaning of white and gray, Fitzgerald employs them to signify the lack of significance or uniformity of certain subjects.\n\nFitzgerald initially introduces the technique of using colors to convey meaning when describing Daisy. After a period with minimal use of the colors, he reappears with Daisy wearing a white dress, which reduces her character to a uniform, unremarkable entity that Gatsby desires. This technique is further utilized by Fitzgerald to portray Daisy in a more uniform and unremarkable light. For example, her fur collar is described as a \"gray haze,\" and she is again dressed in white before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "The San Diego County region is notable for its high agricultural productivity, largely due to its pleasant climate and abundant sunlight. Farmers in the area cultivate a diverse range of crops, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. A significant demand exists for locally sourced, organic produce, resulting in long waiting lists for community-supported agriculture programs. Organic dairy products, such as eggs and milk, are also in high demand. Many organic farms in the area offer guided tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for outdoor activities like hiking and birdwatching. This type of agricultural operation allows landowners to take advantage of government incentives while promoting habitat conservation, enabling recreational use, and creating opportunities for educational programs and tours.\n\nIn addition to catering to a lucrative niche market, organic farming often brings about increased biodiversity in the surrounding area due to the absence of chemical pesticides and fertilizers in the soil and water. However, organic farming can be more labor-intensive and costly compared to conventional farming methods. It requires more hands-on care to manage pests, weeds, and soil quality without using chemicals, leading to potentially higher losses. Small-scale organic farms also face efficiency challenges due to their limited size compared to larger operations. Furthermore, implementing beneficial non-organic practices, such as planting cover crops, controlling invasive species, and managing plant growth, can incur additional labor costs.\n\nConsidering these factors, a landowner in this scenario may seek financial assistance or expert guidance to maximize both profits and environmental quality. The chosen land, located near the town of Potrero in San Diego County, California, comprises 160 acres of chaparral, non-native grasslands, and oak woodlands adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This area is situated within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently evaluates over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered or threatened, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and several butterfly species.\n\nHistorically, this land was inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood traders in the late 19th century. The property was part of a homestead patent and likely used for grazing and wood harvesting for many years. To explore available government programs and their potential benefits for small farmers, I selected a piece of land from a real estate website and researched relevant options. For the purpose of this example, I examined an organic farm in the same area to illustrate a realistic approach to balancing economic viability with wildlife conservation.",
            "Negotiations are heavily influenced by the cultural context in which they take place. Culture can be defined as much by its nuances as by its explicit characteristics. It is not a uniform or monolithic entity, but rather a complex tapestry of various aspects. Generalizations, such as assuming all members of a particular culture share the same traits, are overly simplistic and inaccurate. To be effective in negotiations, it is more productive to understand how a culture's values and attitudes relate to the specific issue at hand and how they may impact the negotiation process. When interacting with a foreign culture, individuals often draw comparisons to their own culture, leading to a more relatable understanding.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset can involve exploring its history, traditions, and biases. Rather than judging or trying to alter a culture, it is essential to accept it for what it is and work within its boundaries, particularly in negotiations. When in a weaker bargaining position, respecting traditions and beliefs can help bridge cultural divides and facilitate progress in negotiations. The cultural landscape is not limited to a national or international divide; corporate cultures can be just as distinct, with variations in work-life balance, communication styles, and values. For instance, a company may prioritize long work hours or a more relaxed atmosphere, and these differences can be seen in employee dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. \n\nIt is vital to consider the underlying values that shape a culture, as they provide the foundation for its behavior. In cultures where preserving face or communal harmony is crucial, a negotiator would be unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superior to achieve success at the negotiation table. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that values a hard-driving approach may be less inclined to settle for the first available option. Taking these cultural nuances into account before the negotiation can significantly improve the outcome. Nevertheless, it is also essential for a negotiator to gain a personal understanding of their opponent to achieve effective results.",
            "The statement \"There is no God\" is attributed to the fool in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and it forms the foundation of St. Anselm's argument for the existence of God. Similarly, Thomas Aquinas defends the same concept, making it essential to consider both their arguments side by side. Given that our objective is to compare their reasoning, we will assume that both thinkers believe in the God of the Bible, as a hypothetical God-like figure could dilute the comparison since their arguments are specifically tailored to this particular concept. Although both authors present valid points, we argue that neither provides a comprehensive basis for believing in God.\n\nTo illustrate this point, let's examine the core idea of St. Anselm's argument. Anselm suggests a path to understanding God through introspection, contending that the existence of God can be deduced from within one's own mind. According to Anselm, since we cannot imagine a God's nonexistence, it implies that God's existence is inherent in our understanding. This concept, while articulated in Anselm's own terminology, essentially proposes that the truth about God is accessible through self-reflection, without requiring external evidence. This perspective is closely tied to the Christian concept of faith, which often involves accepting truths without definitive empirical proof.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas presents a different perspective, advocating that the existence of God can be proven solely through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith. This approach would be advantageous in evangelism, as it would enable the conversion of new followers without relying on their willingness to accept unproven claims. Aquinas outlines five logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. By demonstrating the logical necessity of God's existence, Aquinas argues that we can infer the existence of God without needing to see direct evidence.",
            "Around 2,500 years ago, a prince who would eventually be known as the Buddha was born, marking the beginning of a spiritual journey that would eventually lead to the establishment of Buddhism. Over the course of his life, he abandoned worldly life and achieved enlightenment, leaving behind a legacy of teachings that have undergone significant transformations over time. This evolution is evident in countries like Sri Lanka, where the Theravada nation celebrates the annual water-cutting ceremony, which has no basis in the Buddha's original teachings. The differences between the original teachings and the current practices are so profound that they span from superficial traditions to the fundamental principles of the religion. As a result, the Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt its core beliefs, influenced by both internal and external factors, ranging from friendly to hostile.\n\nTo better understand this discussion, it is essential to note the distinction between internal and external forces. Internal forces refer to changes driven by the Buddhist community itself, regardless of their monastic status, while external forces originate from non-Buddhists. Additionally, hostile forces aim to harm or damage the Buddhist community, whereas benign forces neither intend to harm nor help the community, although their actions might have unintended consequences.\n\nThis analysis begins by examining the fundamental principles of Theravada Buddhism. At its core, Buddhists seek refuge in the Triple Gem, consisting of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma encompasses the Tripitaka, a collection of three baskets of sacred texts, including the Sutta Pitaka, which contains sermons, the Vinaya Pitaka, which outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, which delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These metaphysical concepts, such as Anatta (the absence of a permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (the impermanence of all things), are the keys to escaping Sansara, the cycle of rebirth and death, and ultimately achieving liberation from lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). In the Vinaya Pitaka, guidelines for laypeople and monks are outlined, including the five precepts for laymen and a more extensive set of rules for monks. The most fundamental principles of Buddhism revolve around the four noble truths: Dukkha (the truth of suffering), the cause of suffering (attachment), and the possibility of overcoming suffering.",
            "A notable example of a long-standing rivalry between two nations is the relationship between the United States and Mexico, which endured for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. This animosity reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the U.S. successfully defeated Mexico, gaining control of Texas and the American Southwest. The rivalry between the two nations was marked by various conflicts, which gradually subsided before the onset of World War I. Initially, the disagreement stemmed from fundamental differences in religion, culture, and tradition, as well as competing material interests. \n\nThis scenario is reminiscent of numerous other nations that share a border, often leading to clashes of interests and the formation of rival positions. The U.S. and Mexico's relationship is similar to other long-standing rivalries between neighboring countries. David M. Pletcher notes that Mexico and Cuba are the only two nations with long-standing issues in their diplomatic relations with the U.S. (Pletcher 1977, p. 41). Given their geographical proximity to the U.S., these countries have historically been its rivals, whereas other Latin American nations have generally enjoyed good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences created a significant divide between the two nations, a common issue that has affected many countries throughout history. According to Sally Frahm, Americans have historically opposed Catholicism and monarchy, mirroring their opposition to fascism and communism in the 20th century (Frahm 2001, p. 86). This rivalry, like the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, was partly driven by ideological differences and partly by competition over vital interests. However, in this case, the ideological struggles revolved around the two nations' differing religious preferences, inherited from their former colonial rulers and contributing to their distrust of each other. This legacy of distrust posed a significant obstacle to establishing friendly relations between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 disputes between Mexico and the U.S. during the 57-year period of rivalry. Most of these disputes concerned territorial issues, such as cross-border raids and frontier problems. The issue of border raids by outlaws and bandits from American border towns was a persistent problem that was eventually addressed through joint military efforts by both countries (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry between the two nations began to dissipate as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the U.S. and American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (Schmitt 1974, p. 110). This marked the beginning of the end of the long-standing rivalry between the two nations in the late 19th century.",
            "It has been fifteen years since an unexpected illness left me disabled, erasing my identity as a nurse, a profession I had chosen as a means of achieving stability. I was driven by a deep-seated desire for security, which was a result of my tumultuous childhood. The notion that I would always be able to find employment, as people would always require medical care, resonated with me, and so I pursued nursing despite my true aspirations to be a scientist or journalist. However, life had other plans, and at 46, I found myself penniless and unable to work. Fifteen years of living on disability benefits have left me with nothing to call my own, and every day is a struggle to maintain my sense of security and self-worth. \n\nIt's a harsh reality that even the strongest individuals need help during times of crisis, and I owe my survival to the unwavering support of my family and close friends. The truth is, we are not invincible, and even the most resilient people crumble when faced with real adversity. \n\nMy point is that life is unpredictable, and no matter how well-prepared we think we are, there will always be challenges that surpass our capabilities. The notion that we should rely solely on our own abilities to overcome difficulties is misguided. In the United States, I believe it's time to shift our focus from solely relying on the government to a more community-driven approach, where individuals learn to trust and support one another. This mindset is rooted in the country's history, as our forefathers thrived during difficult times not through rugged individualism, but through compassion, mutual respect, and resource sharing. The pioneers who traversed the American West in wagon trains did not achieve their goals alone; they relied on each other for support.\n\nWhile it's essential to be prepared for emergencies, having a disaster kit, first aid supplies, and other essentials is not a substitute for building strong relationships with those around us. I advocate for a balanced approach that combines preparedness with a sense of community and mutual aid. If feasible, investing in a small farm, a wood stove, or other self-sufficiency measures can be beneficial, but it's equally crucial to foster connections with your neighbors and be willing to ask for help when needed.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in a particular way remains a complex and unanswered one. Despite the efforts of scientists like D'Arcy Thompson, who made groundbreaking statements on the subject in 1917, there is still a long way to go in defining the intricate patterns of organic forms. Recent studies have applied mathematical modeling to better understand the development of shells in mollusks, a field pioneered by researchers such as Raup and Stanley in 1981. Our research is focused on using mathematical models of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in the species Prunum in conjunction with experimental studies to uncover the underlying mechanisms that guide the direction and magnitude of evolutionary change. By analyzing X-ray images of Prunum species, we have identified quantitative parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters were inputted into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995) to simulate various shell shapes and sizes.\n\nA shell can be envisioned as a cylindrical structure that progresses through 360 degrees of space over time. Each complete rotation of the shell is referred to as a whorl, which spirals around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which the whorls expand can vary, and a continuous line separating each whorl is called a suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the final one, known as the body whorl. The central part of the shell, excluding the last whorl, is referred to as the spire. The spire's tip is the apex, while the opposite end is the base. The shell's opening, through which the animal emerges, is called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various perspectives, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. In standard orientation, the shell is viewed from the apertural perspective, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count the number of whorls, an observer must first view the shell from the apical perspective and identify the starting point of the first suture. A line is then drawn to divide the shell into two parts, and the whorls are counted from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of openings that move through time and space as the animal builds its shell. By tracking the path of the aperture using the coordinates of the center of each whorl's opening and its horizontal and vertical radius, it is possible to graphically and mathematically represent the shell's development. Once a mathematical model is established, it can be modified by varying parameters to alter the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained largely unchanged over the past decade.  Despite Indonesia being on track to meet several Millennium Development Goals, such as its targets for water and sanitation, the country is struggling to make sufficient progress in improving child and maternal health. The impending deadline of 2015 for achieving these goals is now looming, and the underlying reasons for this stagnation will be explored below. These reasons highlight the need to revamp the overall healthcare system rather than focusing solely on specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has made some advancements in the number of births attended by skilled healthcare professionals, with 72% now meeting this benchmark. However, this statistic includes traditional workers like midwives, who may not have the necessary medical expertise to handle complicated pregnancies, contributing to the significant number of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhaging. Consequently, the progress in this area is somewhat misleading, and more work remains to be done. Furthermore, there has been a decline in the proportion of children under five treated by a healthcare professional for diarrheal cases, and the data on postnatal care is incomplete, revealing a pressing concern that warrants attention.\n\nThe rate of cesarean sections is still lower than expected, standing at around 4%. This figure also underscores a more pressing issue, as the rate of cesarean sections in urban settings is significantly higher (7%) compared to rural areas (2%). This disparity highlights the unequal distribution of healthcare services, with access largely concentrated in urban areas. Another issue is the vertical inequity in healthcare access, where there is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the underprivileged face significant barriers in accessing healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nWhen considering the next steps towards enhancing neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is how to effectively address the shortage of healthcare services. Specifically, Indonesia should decide whether to develop targeted program-specific approaches or strengthen its overall healthcare system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children. While programmatic approaches may be attractive, offering targeted, manageable objectives and faster results, they also have some drawbacks. One significant disadvantage is that investing heavily in a particular area of the health sector can divert resources away from other essential areas, causing a shortage of human resources in those areas. Another issue is the duplication and lack of coordination between programs, resulting in excessive paperwork and administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian novels are characterized by their meticulous descriptions and a focus on the upper class of the time period. However, two novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, diverge from this tradition by incorporating elements of mystery and the unconventional. These novels use these mysterious elements to provide insight into their characters' motivations and emotions, making them more complex and believable. \n\nCharles Dickens' writing in Oliver Twist exemplifies this use of mystery through dream sequences and dreamlike states. In this novel, these strange events often reveal Oliver's inner turmoil, the sources of his pain, and his growing awareness of the harsh realities surrounding him. For instance, when Oliver is shot in chapter 28, he vividly relives the event, still reeling from the trauma. The passage highlights Oliver's lack of control over the situation, as well as the dire state of his health, which is vividly portrayed through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, and his senses become numb as he is carried away by an unseen force. This experience is a powerful portrayal of Oliver's helplessness, as he is unable to influence the outcome of the event, even when his life is at risk. This reinforces the notion that Oliver lacks agency, and a growing sense of defeat is implied, as if Fagin's influence has broken him, leading to a state of despair. It can be inferred that Oliver would have taken action to save himself if he had not been so consumed by hopelessness. \n\nSimilarly, in the same novel, Dickens uses another passage to convey the sense of time distortion and despair that Oliver experiences: \"The day passed off quickly – in fact, it was over before it had begun – and night came on again, a long and dreadful night that seemed to last forever, yet was fleeting and short-lived.\"",
            "It's been a while since I was involved in an after-school tutoring program for elementary school students. My main focus was helping them with any subject they were struggling with, but my strengths lay in English and reading. I was approached by one of the instructors to work with a boy named Adrian, who was having significant trouble with reading. Initially, it seemed like he had a peculiar issue, as some letters he could pronounce correctly, while others were completely off. Adrian's background was Latino, but he spoke fluent English. We continued to work together until I met his mother, who only spoke Spanish. Despite my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate. It was then that I realized Adrian's reading struggles were not due to his ability to read, but rather his unfamiliarity with the English alphabet. I'm not sure if this insight helped him much, but I hope he's made progress since then.\n\nI share this story to highlight the challenge of language barriers in schools, particularly in California. It's clear that this is a widespread issue, even among students who speak English fluently. It can be a significant obstacle for them, and it's essential that we find a solution. In Adrian's case, the solution was straightforward: targeted English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children who barely speak English, the solution is more complex. There is no one-size-fits-all answer, and it requires a combination of various approaches. These might include dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, or a combination of these. The key is to integrate multiple strategies.\n\nThe dual language system is an excellent concept, not just for students whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Research has shown that students in two-way bilingual education programs tend to outperform their peers academically. Many people fear that implementing such programs will be a waste of resources and only benefit a minority of students. However, this is a misconception. If we made dual language programs the norm, rather than the exception, all students would benefit from them. The challenge lies in implementing this, such as providing bilingual support staff, including tutors, aides, or other specialists, to assist teachers in the classroom. While it may be unrealistic to require all teachers to be bilingual, having bilingual support staff can make a significant difference.",
            "From a young age, many of us are first introduced to the idea that there exists something greater than ourselves, something that transcends our understanding.  We may receive instruction in this concept through various channels, such as attending Sunday school, visiting a temple, or exploring our own inner selves.  While some people readily accept the spiritual traditions passed down to them by their parents, others reject them outright, convinced that there is no truth beyond their own perception.  As we navigate life, we often question and reassess our values and beliefs, adopting new perspectives and spiritual paths that resonate with us.  In our search for meaning and purpose, we seek guidance to lead us out of darkness and into the light.\n\nIn a moment of introspection, my father shared with me his favorite type of bird, the cardinal, as we sat together on the porch, listening to the rain pour down on the tin roof.  His distant gaze into the rain suggested a mix of contemplation and reminiscence.  His frail appearance, accentuated by the loss of weight and a receding hairline, made me feel a sense of isolation and fear.  I avoided discussing my sadness about his impending loss, aware that acknowledging it would make it harder for both of us to cope.  I instinctively drew closer to him, and we sat together in silence, watching the rain during the twilight of June.\n\nMy father passed away in December, just five days after my 22nd birthday.  Despite the chemotherapy and radiation, he had lived a few months longer than the doctors had predicted, but his suffering only prolonged the agony.  I wondered if a higher power could have done something to ease his pain.  During that difficult night, I did not pray, questioning the existence of a God who seemed to have abandoned me. \n\nI had not wanted to witness my father's departure from this life, and so I chose not to be present.  I did not want to remember him by how he died but by how he lived.  I knew my father better than anyone else, and I believed he would not have wanted me to be a bystander at his death.  I spent three days in a state of emotional numbness, waiting for the news, but no one reached out to me.",
            "The Gothic novel is a contradictory concept, as Ian Watt describes it, combining the ideas of 'old' and 'new' in a single entity. The genre has received both criticism and praise, with some viewing it as lacking depth and others appreciating its ability to evoke a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). When Horace Walpole created the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, he drew upon the elements of both ancient and modern romances to create a new form of literary expression. By merging \"old\" theatrical characteristics with the \"new\" style of modern novels, Walpole coined the term \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre frequently incorporates elements from medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. At the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication, the term \"Gothic\" was used to describe various people, styles, and time periods, often with a negative connotation, implying a lack of sophistication compared to \"modern\" societal and literary advancements. The combination of the dramatic \"Gothic\" style with the novel's innovative format, which allows readers to directly experience the characters' psychology, has enabled the Gothic genre to remain relevant for a long time and to be perceived as both outdated and novel to readers separated from the original writing by time.\n\nOne of the key ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of chivalry. The medieval notion of chivalry, which emphasizes the development of a proper knight, is reinterpreted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry holds significance for Gothic writers due to its representation of the ideal knight: brave, honorable, and capable. Writers, particularly Walpole, were drawn to this ideal because they perceived a lack of it in their contemporary society. By incorporating chivalric concepts and values, the \"gothic past\" is romanticized and idealized, foreshadowing the evolution of Gothic into Romanticism, and used as a means to critique the present. Walpole, who wrote The Castle of Otranto during a tumultuous period in his life, amid political turmoil and unfair accusations, may have subconsciously felt that the perceived goodness and morality of the gothic era had been lost in his contemporaries. This sentiment is evident in the character of Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, such as being described as a prince who has suffered and is said to have been wronged by infidels. This portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is an exaggerated representation, introducing the tropes of excess that would become characteristic of the Gothic genre (66).",
            "Supply chain management encompasses a wide array of processes involved in getting goods from the initial customer order to the final delivery to the customer. The term was coined by Keith Oliver in 1982, a consultant who described the comprehensive process of planning, implementing, and controlling supply chain activities to meet customer needs efficiently and quickly. Effective supply chain management relies on six crucial elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers leverage these elements to deliver exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction is the foundation of the supply chain process, laying the groundwork for the entire sequence of events. To initiate production, managers must understand customer preferences, which can be gauged by analyzing market trends. By doing so, they can determine the products in demand, decide on production quantities, and select the optimal production location and facility to meet customer expectations for volume and quality. Every aspect of production, from scheduling workloads to equipment maintenance, is critical to the process's success. Inadequate planning can lead to wasted time and resources, as exemplified by large retailers like Wal-Mart and Target, which establish detailed processes and protocols for each aspect of their business.\n\nSupply is the second vital component of supply chain management, encompassing strategic decisions regarding a company's core capabilities and partnerships. This involves assessing the optimal distribution of production processes among various divisions, each with its own equipment, workforce, and specializations. Managers may choose to outsource certain tasks to other companies to enhance velocity – the ability to deliver high-quality products while maintaining low costs or reducing costs further. By making informed decisions about supply, companies can streamline their operations and better meet customer demands.",
            "Ellen Page, known for her role in the film Juno, holds a cardboard sign with an unsettling message in Burma, a country in Southeast Asia ruled by a ruthless military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup. The sign reads \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" In 2007, a series of protests broke out in the country, led by Burmese monks who wore saffron robes. These protests, known as the Saffron Revolution, initially sparked public interest and were allowed by the government. However, the situation soon escalated into violence, with the military invading and looting monasteries and foreign journalists being arrested and imprisoned. A Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed in September 2007 for covering the protests. While the official death toll is 13, Colonel Hla Win, a defected army colonel, claimed that the actual number of fatalities is much higher.\n\nThis phenomenon is not new. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain control over their populations. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine authority, while Japanese emperors were believed to be gods. Even in modern times, some leaders have engaged in similar behavior. For instance, the Chinese government responded to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests with a violent crackdown, resulting in a disputed death toll ranging from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide in the 1990s, carried out by Hutu militia groups and the Rwandan government, another example of systematic violence against a particular group. The Holocaust, led by Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, is another extreme example of government-sanctioned violence against a specific ethnicity.",
            "The enduring legacy of Duke Ellington in the realm of jazz is a direct result of his remarkable longevity and creative versatility. Although his piano presence may be subtle in many compositions, as a master composer, Ellington excelled at crafting intricate pieces that showcased the unique talents of each band member. By skillfully designing the framework for improvisation and writing tightly orchestrated passages that highlighted individual band styles, Ellington successfully created a cohesive and original sound for each piece. His deep understanding of the distinct sounds of his players and how they blended together to form a cohesive ensemble enabled him to compose some of the most innovative and groundbreaking pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative approach to music by mentioning Creole Love Call, which exemplifies his use of voice as a versatile instrument throughout his career. This early piece showcases his ability to incorporate voice as a sonic element without being bound by lyrics, adding texture and depth to his music. The structure of Creole Love Call, a slow twelve-bar blues piece with six distinct choruses, is a testament to Ellington's skill in complementing the unique styles of his soloists. The six choruses of Creole Love Call feature a range of musical elements, including a call-and-response pattern, a muted trumpet solo, a sweeping clarinet solo, and a climactic reed section.\n\nEllington's use of voice in Creole Love Call is just one example of his ability to introduce new dimensions of tone color to his music. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington demonstrates his mastery of orchestration and his ear for tone color by combining a call-and-response phrase between a muted trumpet and scat singing. This approach to music is further refined in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Ellington skillfully utilizes the unique sound of Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone to introduce the melody, creating a rich and complementary sound.",
            "She had always felt a persistent sense of longing, a desire that remained unfulfilled. This feeling started to manifest at the age of 14, as she began to navigate the challenges of adolescence. Three years later, at 17, she had come to realize that her desire wasn't for material possessions, but for a deeper connection with someone. However, she found herself disinterested in the boys around her, and despite some suitors' efforts to win her over, none of them truly resonated with her. She often struggled to understand the root of her feelings, and as the years went by, she considered various theories, but none seemed convincing enough to explain her situation. As a result, she continued to live life, grappling with her desires.\n\nLife at home was typically peaceful, thanks to her parents' calm demeanor. They rarely argued with each other, and even their conversations with her were infrequent. The only disagreements they had were about her strong sense of independence and free-spirited nature, which often contrasted with their more laid-back personalities. Her parents' even-tempered approach to life was an interesting contrast to her own lively personality, which made her all the more endearing to those around her.\n\nHowever, today was not a typical day. As she wandered from room to room, searching for inspiration, she heard a faint cry from the kitchen, followed by the sound of her mother's distressed voice. Rushing into the room, she grew anxious and frantically asked, \"Mom, what's wrong?!\" Upon seeing her mother lying on the ground, clutching her side in pain, she rushed to her side and tried to assist her. \"Ouch... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother managed to stammer between ragged breaths. Recognizing her mother's intense pain, she quickly offered to help, asking, \"Okay, Mom, where can you pick you up?\" Her mother pointed her in the right direction, and at that moment, her daughter felt grateful for the self-defense classes she had taken, which allowed her to lift and support her mother. She carefully placed her mother in the car and drove her to the hospital.\n\nUpon arriving at the hospital, the strong scent of disinfectant and the atmosphere of anxiety filled the air, but her daughter's focus remained on supporting her mother. She quickly brought her mother to the examination area and signaled for medical help. As the doctors and nurses gathered around, they quickly assessed her mother's condition and transferred her to a rolling bed. Her daughter was left to sit and worry, anxiously waiting for news about her mother's condition.\n\nIt turned out that her mother had slipped off a step stool while reaching for a vase on a high cabinet.",
            "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether adhering to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet) is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease and stroke, as well as stroke mortality. The study focused on a modified version of the Med diet, known as the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet,\" which emphasizes consuming more plant-based foods, including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, along with higher intakes of monounsaturated fats and fish, while minimizing animal products and saturated fats. The study also allowed for moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious studies had shown that adherence to a Med diet is associated with a lower risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, and that it is more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving cholesterol levels in obese individuals. However, previous research had not specifically examined the relationship between the Med diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study, which was part of the Nurses' Health Study, a large cohort study of female nurses in the US, followed 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 years without a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes. The researchers calculated an aMed diet score based on self-reported food frequency questionnaires completed six times between 1984 and 2004. The high participation rate of over 95% throughout the 20-year study period ensured the reliability of the data. The questionnaires were validated through medical records, autopsy, and death certificates, with cases of heart disease and stroke confirmed through review of these documents. Additional factors such as body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, and menopausal status were also accounted for.\n\nTo account for individual variations in dietary habits and better represent long-term dietary intake, the researchers calculated the cumulative average of the aMed score from the repeated questionnaires. They adjusted for potential confounding factors, including age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the study found that a higher aMed diet score was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke in women. Over a 20-year follow-up period, the researchers identified 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women with the highest aMed diet score had a lower risk of both heart disease and stroke compared to those with the lowest score, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "In 2007, the United States faced an severe economic downturn caused by a financial crisis that has persisted to this day. The aftermath of the crisis saw rising unemployment and a collapsed housing market, resulting in the downfall of numerous major corporations. In order to understand and prevent such events from recurring, it is essential to investigate the causes behind the crisis. Essentially, the crisis was triggered by reckless and ill-advised governmental decisions that forced banks and financial institutions to issue high-risk sub-prime loans to an already fragile financial structure. Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were compelled to purchase and repackage these sub-prime mortgages into complex financial instruments, such as CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks faced significant financial shortfalls, which were subsequently transferred to the repackaged mortgages and the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis date back to the late 1990s, during President Clinton's administration. In an attempt to secure re-election, the Clinton administration relaxed lending regulations, paving the way for the subsequent sub-prime crisis. As reported by Steven Holmes of the New York Times in 1999, Fannie Mae was under pressure from the government to increase mortgage lending to low-income households, while also facing pressure from shareholders to maintain its rapid growth in profits. Holmes' insightful commentary predicted that the government-backed corporation might encounter difficulties in case of an economic downturn, necessitating a government bailout akin to the one for the savings and loan industry in the 1980s. Unfortunately, his warning turned out to be prophetic, as the economy eventually experienced a catastrophic meltdown.\n\nA combination of factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the emergence of novel and complex mortgage products, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). The extensive use of these products led to increased interconnectedness of various sectors of the economy with the housing market, causing households and financial markets to become heavily leveraged and vulnerable to even minor price fluctuations. As a result, the housing bubble eventually burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities facing significant losses.\n\nThe extent of the crisis became apparent in 2007, when the top five U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, accounting for approximately 30% of the country's GDP. The crisis led to the collapse of Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch, while Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to transform into commercial banks subject to stringent regulations. Fannie and Freddie, burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "The infamous exposition - that part of the story where writers often struggle to strike the right balance between revealing essential information and overwhelming their readers. While it's meant to be an opportunity for creative expression, it can just as easily lead to eye-glazing passages that leave readers yawning or, worse still, hitting the \"Back\" button in frustration. Even seasoned writers like Dr. Merlin have been guilty of succumbing to the temptation of lengthy exposition, often with less-than-ideal results.\n\nExposition is a common pitfall that many writers face, despite being familiar with the fundamental principle, \"Show, don't tell.\" It's the internal voice that whispers to get necessary details out of the way, often disguising itself as efficiency. However, this \"devil on the shoulder\" can lead to dry, information-heavy passages that fail to engage readers.\n\nTo illustrate this point, consider a narrative where the author tells the reader about a character's entire history, including their meeting with their partner, their wedding, and the partner's tragic demise, all within a few lines of dialogue. This approach would likely fall flat, leaving the reader uninvested in the character's fate and lacking insight into their emotional depth. A more effective approach would be to gradually reveal the character's personality, background, and relationships through subtle actions, speech, and interactions, allowing the reader to form a genuine connection.\n\nFor instance, instead of being told that a character's husband loved them deeply, the reader should experience it through his words, mannerisms, and the heroine's reactions to him. This nuanced portrayal would make his eventual death more impactful and allow the reader to empathize with the heroine's emotional journey. By providing more depth to the story's surface-level narrative, writers can craft a richer, more engaging experience for their readers.\n\nAs a writer, it's essential to resist the temptation to rush through exposition, especially when introducing new characters or plot points. Even seemingly minor details, such as a character's past experiences or motivations, can be presented in a way that feels organic and engaging, rather than info-dumping. By doing so, writers can create a more immersive and memorable story that draws readers in and refuses to let go.",
            "I watched live news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, on August 13, 2011. The first newscast I viewed was from NBC 4 in the morning. The leading story reported on a shocking incident in Ashley, Ohio, where a man named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife, although her name was not revealed. The news segment showed his mug shot, and he appeared to exude an eerie aura. The story was covered for approximately two minutes as it was still developing. Given the circumstances, it seemed like an adequate amount of time was devoted to this story.\n\nThe second story concerned an early morning shooting in the Sharon Woods area, in which an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers was critically injured but no arrests had been made at the time. The SWAT team was investigating. This story seemed brief, and I suspect it might have been due to the fact that the victim was a minority and the incident occurred in a predominantly minority neighborhood. My observation over the years has been that minority victims of crime often receive less media attention compared to those from the majority group. \n\nThe next story reported on a gunshot hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were provided about the suspected location of the incident, and it was determined that a .22 caliber rifle bullet had struck the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers was offering a substantial reward for any information leading to the identification of the shooter.\n\nThe following story was about the impending rain and thunderstorms forecasted for Saturday afternoon. They predicted temperatures to remain in the mid-to-low eighties for the weekend. The segment was a bit concise, possibly intended to pique viewers' interest and encourage them to stay tuned.\n\nAdditionally, the news aired a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. According to reports, a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt robbed the store, described as being around six feet tall and weighing approximately 150 pounds. I found it peculiar that they gave an unusual amount of emphasis on his skin color and darkness.\n\nThe final story I viewed was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin, who had been found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. It was noted that he received a 300-month prison sentence instead of stating it as 25 years. I'm unsure if this phrasing was intended to convey a harsher punishment or simply to highlight the duration. The news also identified Rodriguez as a Hispanic man, but I don't believe this detail was pertinent to the story.",
            "There exists a profound bond between brothers, an unbreakable and irreversible connection that encompasses a wide range of complex emotions such as love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers possess a deep understanding of one another that surpasses their relationships with anyone else, often seeing themselves reflected in their sibling. In times of crisis, the true essence of this bond is revealed, whether it is characterized by positivity or negativity. The consequences of these emotions can be far-reaching and often come at a great cost. To comprehend the emotions stemming from this fraternal connection, one must also consider the repercussions that accompany them. When an individual can look into their brother's eyes and see their own reflection, they gain insight into their true character, which is often revealed through their actions and the outcomes of those actions. The novel \"The Scarlet Ibis\" explores this theme through the tumultuous relationship between two brothers, their intense emotions, and the vivid description of their surroundings. \n\nThe protagonist's actions are primarily driven by one dominating emotion: pride. From their initial journey together to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist harbors resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle. The protagonist had envisioned a brother who could participate in various activities and share in his experiences, such as exploring the outdoors and engaging in physical activities. However, Doodle's congenital heart condition made it highly unlikely that he would be able to participate in these activities, shattering the protagonist's dreams. The protagonist even harbors anger towards Doodle, as evidenced by his thoughts of harming him. Nevertheless, the child's smile brings out a deep-seated love within the protagonist, indicating that his feelings for his brother were not as superficial as they initially seemed. This internal conflict highlights the complexities of the bond between brothers and the various emotions that arise from it.",
            "The human brain is an intricate and innovative processing system that handles vast amounts of information. Over time, as technology has evolved, so have the metaphors used to describe the brain. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. It's essential to remember that these metaphors are limited and may lead to misconceptions when trying to understand the brain's workings.\n\nThe processing of information begins with sensory organs transforming physical stimuli, such as touch, temperature, sound waves, or light, into electrochemical signals. These sensory inputs are then repeatedly processed by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing methods. For instance, when viewing a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles basic information like color, orientation, and border details to identify the object as a box. Top-down processing, on the other hand, uses previously made decisions to expedite recognition of the object, potentially identifying it as a black box rather than a hole in the background.\n\nOnce the processing reaches a certain level, an attention filter determines the signal's importance and allocates it to the relevant cognitive processes. Although the brain processes every detail when looking at the grass near your shoes, a healthy filter prevents you from consciously perceiving each blade individually. Conversely, you might focus on your name even when spoken in a noisy environment. This cycle of processing and filtering occurs repeatedly and involves multiple stages.\n\nBefore the brain can process information, it must first store it. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, and the method of encoding varies depending on the type of sensory stimulus. For example, verbal input can be encoded according to its visual appearance, its sound, or its meaning. Once stored, information needs to be maintained. Research on animals suggests that working memory, which retains information for about 20 seconds, is sustained through temporary electrical signals passed through specific neurons. Long-term memory is believed to be sustained through the structure of particular types of proteins.\n\nThere are numerous theories on how knowledge is organized within the brain, each based on different approaches such as memory recall, computer science, or neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that there are nodes representing concepts and that these nodes are connected based on their relevance. For instance, in a semantic network, the concept of a \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the looming threats of technology and capitalism in his dystopian novel Brave New World, where individuals prioritize the collective over the individual and are conditioned to crave instant gratification above all else. The citizens are portrayed as mere pawns in a larger game, conditioned to conform to a single ideology dictated by the all-powerful World Controller. Analyzing the work through a Marxist lens reveals Huxley's underlying concerns about the development of these systems. The novel's use of Marxist terminology, such as homogenization and reification, reinforces the idea that Huxley is cautioning against the flaws in the emerging economic systems of his time.\n\nThe novel satirizes capitalism by employing the concept of false consciousness, which suggests that the common masses are unaware of their true relationships with other economic classes due to ideological control. The lower classes, like the Deltas and Gammas, are conditioned to prioritize consumption, spending, and indulgence through hypnopædia, while the upper classes, such as the Alphas and Betas, are born with the privilege of awareness but often fail to challenge the status quo. The novel portrays a society where the lower classes are oblivious to their manipulation, perpetuating a system that serves the interests of the ruling elite. The interactions between individuals in Brave New World are superficial, lacking depth and genuine connections, suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism stifles human free will and emotional expression. The characters' complacency with their assigned roles in the hierarchy and their absolute obedience to the community reflect Marxist ideas about the exploited proletariat, who are led to believe in their own superiority as long as they conform to the norms of consumerism and obedience.\n\nRelationships between individuals are nonexistent in Brave New World, and the novel's portrayal of interactions highlights the dehumanizing effects of capitalism. The characters' limited emotional ranges and shallow conversations, often focused on physical appearances, illustrate the ways in which capitalism reduces individuals to mere commodities. The novel's depiction of a society where people are willing to conform to their predetermined roles and accept their place in the hierarchy is a commentary on the oppressive nature of capitalism and the ways in which it erodes human consciousness and relationships.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for approximately two and a half years, which is equivalent to four and a half semesters. For many of my peers and myself, navigating the campus is often a challenge. During my freshman year, I was accommodated in an East Halls dorm, situated near the eastern edge of the campus, excluding the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. The distance between my home in Stuart Hall and my classes in the Willard building, which is centrally located, could take up to 25 minutes to cover on foot, especially during inclement weather, which is common in State College. Upon conversing with an alumnus roughly my age, I discovered that the East Halls dorms were previously isolated from the rest of the campus by vast empty spaces. However, these areas have since been transformed into sports facilities, state-of-the-art buildings such as the new Creamery and health services building, and surrounded by apartments. As the campus continues to expand, the issue of mobility becomes increasingly pressing. In this context, the most effective solution is undoubtedly cycling. Nonetheless, owning a bike is not enough; students need to actively use them, and the campus infrastructure must be designed with the needs of cyclists in mind.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who had resumed cycling after a several-year break. He expressed his surprise at why he had ever stopped, saying, \"Bikes are fantastic, they were only considered uncool for a few years, but they're the best way to get around.\" Cycling not only provides a physical workout but is also the most efficient mode of transportation. Combining a healthy breakfast with moderate exercise can cover considerable distances, such as 30 miles or more. As many undergraduates do, I now reside off-campus, at a similar distance from the campus center as some dorms. This academic year, the most intelligent decision I made was purchasing a bike. Every day, I attend classes in Thomas building, which is approximately a 25-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike significantly reduces this time to just 5 minutes if I pedal at a decent pace. Nevertheless, Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my residence, but it's not always a straightforward road to travel on, whether I'm on a bike or not. While walking has its advantages, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn't own a bike, walking would be my only reliable means of transportation to class, which would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day. This translates to over 2.5 hours every week, not to mention the additional time spent walking to other classes, appointments, and various other activities. This is more time than I can afford to spare."
