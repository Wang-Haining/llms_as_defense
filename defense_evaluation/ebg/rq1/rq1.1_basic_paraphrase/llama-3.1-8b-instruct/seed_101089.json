            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "As I pursue a degree in social work, my goal is to embark on a career path within the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on supporting children who have been abused or neglected, as well as helping troubled families. The values I plan to bring to this field include a commitment to providing service, showing respect, maintaining an ethical approach, and continually enhancing my professional skills to stay up-to-date in my field. These core values not only guide social workers, but they are also deeply personal to me.\n\nI have always been driven to make a positive impact on others, but I initially struggled to identify a specific career path. Through my experiences in high school and college, I witnessed individuals coping with problems in unhealthy ways, which led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break, still uncertain about my career path. One summer, I visited a friend whose sixteen-year-old guest was trying to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that the teenager had contacted the police, and I accompanied them to his parents' residence to offer assistance. The police asked me to speak with the parents, as they were unable to intervene directly. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed evasive and made excuses for their son's behavior. This experience deepened my commitment to a career in social work, specifically to help families resolve conflicts and address the root causes of problems.\n\nAnother essential value for the field of social work is social justice. Our society often emphasizes the importance of individuality and mourns the loss of unique individuals. However, we often prioritize conformity over actual individuality. As someone who values being true to myself, I don't believe in limiting myself to fit in with the majority. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively spoke out against social injustices whenever I could, expressing myself through my appearance, my involvement with the GSBA, and other forms of activism. I firmly believe in the principles of social justice and will continue to advocate for equality and fairness.",
            "This paper delves into the biological and sociocultural models that pertain to insomnia, a disorder that affects an individual's sleep patterns. The biological model emphasizes the genetic and medical factors contributing to insomnia, while the sociocultural model examines the environmental and social influences, such as race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review aims to review and critique the research related to these models, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each study.\n\nInsomnia can be classified as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder associated with another mental health condition, or a sleep disorder resulting from medical complications or substance use. The primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, with Dyssomnias encompassing various conditions such as insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, and circadian rhythm sleep disorder. These disorders involve difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep or staying awake for an extended period. On the other hand, Parasomnias are characterized by abnormal behaviors or physiological occurrences during sleep, such as nightmares, sleep terrors, and sleepwalking.\n\nSleep disorders can also be linked to mental health conditions, specifically those categorized under Axis I (clinical disorders) and Axis II (personality disorders or mental retardation). The focus of this review is on insomnia and primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders explores the genetic and physiological aspects of sleep regulation. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus, particularly those containing orexin, play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study involving mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are responsible for sleep-wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while its inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and improved sleep quality. Furthermore, the study found that a GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep duration in mice. These findings suggest that animal models can be applied to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence of this receptor could lead to sleep disturbances, even without the use of medication. From a sociocultural perspective, this study implies that the inherited phenotype of the receptor could regulate sleep, and any alterations to it could naturally disrupt sleep patterns, affecting various aspects of life, including daily tasks and work performance.",
            "This paper will delve into three key areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with a concise explanation of the disorder, providing an understanding of what CAPD entails. Following this, the diagnostic process for CAPD is explored, highlighting common characteristics or 'red flags' that indicate its presence. Finally, the paper will discuss practical strategies that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom can employ to support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to the brain's efficiency in processing auditory information. It is essentially a neurological condition where the brain struggles to interpret and differentiate sounds, despite the individual having normal hearing. As a result, people with CAPD are not considered hearing-impaired; they can hear sounds clearly, but their brain fails to effectively process and separate them, making it challenging to distinguish between words, conversations, and background noises.\n\nThe concept of CAPD first emerged in the mid-1950s under the name 'auditory imperception' (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), as researchers investigated children with communication disorders. In 1954, the Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing assessment tools for these children, while in 1961, Kimura introduced a novel method called dichotic testing and proposed a model explaining the physiological basis of dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference held in 1977 sparked further research into children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests itself in various ways, including difficulties in localizing sounds in space, distinguishing between multiple sounds, recognizing sound patterns, and detecting changes in speech, such as sarcasm. Additionally, individuals with CAPD may experience sound interference, making it challenging to interpret complex auditory cues and sequence auditory information accurately (Ferre).\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a thorough evaluation is necessary, involving systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests, which may be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals using a range of assessments that evaluate auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). These assessments may include questionnaires, surveys, and observation of auditory behaviors in response to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single, universally accepted diagnostic tool or test for CAPD, and the underlying causes of the disorder remain unknown. Diagnostic tests often involve presenting the individual with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and asking them to differentiate specific items, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the brain's response to these signals.",
            "The play Twelfth Night suggests that disguises can initially be effective in deceiving others, but ultimately, one must abandon the guise to avoid losing their true identity. However, the process of revealing deception can lead to feelings of isolation, making it a difficult decision between self-preservation and preserving relationships with others. While some people may respond calmly to discovering they've been deceived, others may be offended and react negatively.\n\nThe theme of deception through gender role reversal in Twelfth Night raises additional questions, particularly why the character feels the need to hide their true identity and adopt a disguise. Viola, for instance, resorts to disguising herself as a man to protect herself from potential threats while in a foreign land. Although her plan succeeds, it separates her from her female support network and creates complications, including Olivia's confusion of her with her twin brother Sebastian and Orsino's suppressed romantic feelings for her.\n\nTo the modern reader, Twelfth Night can be seen as an example of how deception can facilitate the recognition and exploration of repressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. The play hints that these characters may be driven by unexpressed desires, which are revealed through Viola/Cesario's presence. Olivia's sudden shift in affection from Cesario to Sebastian, as well as her subsequent view of Cesario/Viola as family rather than a romantic partner, may suggest that Olivia is mocking those who judge people based on their appearance, rather than true feelings.",
            "The German colonial regime has been criticized for its harsh treatment, particularly with regards to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge the complexity and diversity of the German colonial administration. The educational systems put in place across the colonies were varied, and even within the same territory, policies and ruling styles differed significantly. When Britain took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a sizable population of well-educated and literate Africans. Similarly, German educational efforts in colonies such as Kamerun were praised by contemporary writers. \n\nHowever, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the government actively supported and established state schools for native education, in South West Africa, the responsibility of educating the indigenous population was largely left to missionary societies that received limited government assistance. \n\nNotably, the government invested considerable resources in the education of European settlers in the colony, establishing a system of state schools and heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. The outcomes of these educational policies persisted in South West Africa long after German rule ended. While many other German colonies showed significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, the vast majority of the population remained illiterate and without access to education. A range of social, political, and economic factors contributed to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper aims to expand the discussion by examining these factors, with a particular focus on new research regarding the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nA substantial body of literature exists on education in the German colonial empire, with the majority of these sources being in German and written during or shortly after the colonial period. The early works primarily focused on describing the educational systems of the colonies, while later studies in English expanded the discourse by conducting comparative analyses of education in various German colonies and more in-depth examinations of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted the significant differences in educational systems across the colonies. A notable work that explicitly addresses the topic of this paper is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa, which compares the educational systems of the two colonies and identifies the factors contributing to their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa is a key factor that explains many of the distinctive aspects of the colony's educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, despite being largely covered in arid desert. This relatively hospitable environment is reflected in the European population, with nearly 15,000 whites residing in South West Africa by 1913, compared to only 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "Over the past 100 years, the classification of popular music has become increasingly complex due to the proliferation of numerous genres. This complexity is further exacerbated by the fact that many prominent genres, such as rock, jazz, country, and folk, have given rise to a multitude of subgenres and sub-subgenres. Among these, heavy metal rock has emerged as one of the most diverse and expressive genres in the past four decades. Characterized by its capacity to convey a wide range of emotions, heavy metal music often leans towards the darker aspects of the emotional spectrum, making it both expressive and diverse.\n\nThe evolution of heavy metal has led to a fragmentation of the genre, with various niches and sub-subgenres emerging over time. As a result, it has become challenging to define the essence of heavy metal music. To understand the contemporary metal music scene, it is essential to grasp the roots and essence of the metal movement.\n\nAt its core, the metal movement is defined by its association with darkness, which is reflected in its emphasis on \"more\" – more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more theatricality. Metal music often features complex, technically proficient musicianship, setting it apart from other genres. Moreover, the metal movement has a strong connection to the use of psychedelic substances, which influenced the creation of some of its most iconic records. The genre's dark, visceral qualities, which were novel in the music scene at the time, have been shaped by various influences, including the Romantic Era's emphasis on the darker aspects of human emotion. The lyrics of classic metal songs, such as \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles, exemplify the genre's affinity for expressing the darker side of human experience.\n\n\"Helter Skelter\" is a notable example of a song that pushed the boundaries of heaviness and darkness in music, with its lyrics and melody reflecting the turbulent, drug-induced state of its creators. This song is often cited as one of the pioneering works of the heavy metal genre, and its release on The White Album was a deliberate attempt by the Beatles to demonstrate their ability to create music that was just as intense as that of the Rolling Stones.",
            "Before the Surrealist artists appeared on the scene, Henri Rousseau was busily creating his own dreamscapes, both literally and figuratively, through his artwork. His 1910 painting, The Dream, is a poignant representation not only of a woman experiencing wonder in a dream world, but also of Rousseau's own aspirations and ambitions as an artist. Since beginning his career, Rousseau had longed for recognition, acclaim, and appreciation from his peers and art enthusiasts. However, this aspiration came with an inner conflict - to conform to established styles to gain acceptance from the art world, or to remain true to his unique vision and artistic voice. The Dream is a powerful reflection of this ongoing internal struggle, one that defined Rousseau's artistic journey.\n\nTo understand The Dream, it's essential to delve into Rousseau's background. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, Rousseau came from a relatively prosperous family. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle. Despite lacking formal artistic training, Rousseau spent decades working for the French municipal toll service, earning a humble living as a gabelou. However, he gained a misleading nickname, douanier, or customs inspector. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children left Rousseau with a single child, Julia, and immense grief. This traumatic event prompted him to seek solace in painting as a means of comfort and new beginnings. Unlike his contemporaries who often romanticized peasants in their art, Rousseau was a folk painter who drew inspiration from the everyday life and aspirations of the common people.\n\nRousseau's desire for recognition in the art world is understandable, given his circumstances. He started his artistic journey late in life, without formal training, and during a time when many talented and well-known artists were already active. His breakthrough came around the same time Matisse began establishing himself as an artist. According to art historian Jan Gordon, while both artists competed in the art world, they differed significantly in style, subject matter, and motivations. Matisse sought to avoid clichés in his work, whereas Rousseau aimed to create conventional art that would earn him acceptance into the prestigious Artiste Français.",
            "There's a long-standing philosophical connection between ethics and aesthetics, and it's rooted in the idea that truth and beauty are inextricably linked. The notion that ethics and beauty are intertwined is not merely a coincidence; it's deeply ingrained in our understanding of the world. As John Keats poignantly expressed in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" beauty is truth, and truth is beauty. This understanding transcends traditional forms of learning, such as education or experience. Instead, it's an inherent aspect of our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics, which are more about describing and interpreting than prescribing specific rules.\n\nWhen it comes to art and morals, our attempts to analyze and critique them often fall short of grasping their essence. For example, discussions about a masterpiece like da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on technical aspects like composition, contrast, and cultural context, but these elements alone cannot fully explain why it's a masterpiece. When people discuss their favorite works of art or literature, they often use phrases like \"there's just something about it,\" implying that there's something intangible and ineffable that cannot be captured by words.\n\nThis is similar to what authors like Flannery O'Connor said about storytelling; it's a way to convey complex ideas that cannot be expressed through straightforward statements. Similarly, ethics has a transcendent quality that cannot be fully described or reduced to a set of qualities. Ludwig Wittgenstein's statement that ethics cannot be expressed and is transcendental resonates with this idea. This intangible aspect of both art and morality is their most powerful attribute, and it's what connects them.\n\nThe connection between ethics and aesthetics is strengthened by the fact that we experience both at a deep, intuitive level, which is often described as noumenal in philosophical terms. This experience is difficult to put into words but is essential to our understanding of both art and morality. Literature, in particular, is distinct from other art forms in its moral qualities, as argued by McKean. While moral standards may not apply to other art forms like music, they are central to literature and its ability to shape our values and understanding of the world. Ultimately, literature is valuable because it reflects and influences our moral compass.",
            "Germany today is a powerful nation with its unique cultural heritage, stretching from the Alps in southern Munich to the Baltic Sea in Kiel, as well as from the Rhine River city of Cologne to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River. This diverse cultural identity is a blend of influences from various sources and tribes. The origins of the term \"Germania\" are shrouded in mystery, with different scholars and historians presenting competing theories. \n\nThe name \"Germania\" is often attributed to the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, according to the Roman historian Tacitus. However, Julius Caesar, who wrote about the Gallic Wars, first used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the Gauls and the Germanic tribes that crossed the Rhine River. Caesar borrowed the term from the Gauls, possibly referring to a neighboring tribe in their language. Another theory suggests that the name \"German\" comes from the word \"ger,\" meaning a type of spear used in warfare, or the Old Irish word \"garim,\" which implies that the Germans were loud or noisy.\n\nTacitus' work, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" written in AD 98, portrays the Germans as an indigenous people who were not significantly influenced by other cultures through migration or intermarriage. He attributes their geographical isolation to the harsh climate, rugged terrain, and unforgiving nature of the region, making it unlikely that people would voluntarily settle there. The Romans, while exploring and conquering Germanic tribes, primarily sent expeditions to trade and acquire resources rather than establishing a permanent presence. As a result, the Germanic tribes interacted with the Roman Empire through trade and military service, shaping their distinct cultural identity.",
            "As I stood there, my mind was blank, taking in the scene before me without processing any emotions. My thoughts flowed in quickly, barely lingering before disappearing again, making it seem like my consciousness was simply observing the scene in front of me without any personal thoughts. This mental state allowed me to experience the world in a fluid way, almost like a detached observer.\n\nThis state of mind was familiar to me, thanks to an artist I worked with who recommended a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had been interested in drawing since I was six, and this book provided a comprehensive guide to learning the art, covering even the basics, such as understanding the properties of a pencil and how our brains interpret lines. The book suggested a technique where you place a frame around the subject you're studying, simplifying a complex image by removing distracting details. \n\nAt that moment, looking at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't mentally impose this frame. I was overwhelmed by the complexity of the scene, so I stood in awe, taking it all in. I thought about the artistic styles of famous artists – Picasso's blue phase, Monet's love of greenery, and the Renaissance masters' use of a wide range of colors. If I wanted to call myself an artist, I felt like I was at the beginning of creating my own work, the start of my story, and I had titled it \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingers landed on my chosen drawing tool, and my hand prepared to create. I focused on the moment, and my hand moved through the air, bringing my creative vision to life. Water swirled and flowed, and a small piece broke away from the whole, disappearing into nothingness. As I tried again, my hand clenched and jerked a bit more forcefully, and I slapped the toilet handle harder, trying to dislodge the uncooperative brown mass stuck at the bottom.\n\nWith the mop in hand, I stood with my feet shoulder-width apart, my green tie awkwardly knotted around my neck, and I frowned at the unpleasant package left for the bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid. After a few more attempts to flush it and a few more moments of introspection, I finally reached for the toilet paper roll on my right, grabbed it, and wrapped my hand in it like a glove. I stood up straight, then bent forward, and slowly submerged my hand into the bowl, mimicking the movement of a mother covering a turkey for Thanksgiving dinner.",
            "The alarming rate of teenage driver fatalities is a concerning issue in the United States.  Several factors contribute to this tragic statistic, including the fact that the adolescent brain is not fully equipped to handle the risks associated with driving.  Additionally, the inexperience of teen drivers is a significant factor in the high number of accidents, rollovers, speeding, and vehicles leaving the road.  Furthermore, when teens drive with their peers, the risk of accidents increases, as highlighted by a study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, which found a correlation between the age of passengers and the number of traffic accidents.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, several states have implemented provisional licenses that restrict the hours teens can drive and prohibit minors from being passengers.  However, I believe that these measures are temporary solutions.  The underlying issue is that, statistically, young drivers are not adequately prepared to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving.  Researcher Marvin Zuckerman suggests that 18 may be too young for a regular driver's license, as individuals under 19-20 tend to seek thrills and take risks.  It would be wise to delay driving until this tendency subsides.  If we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, the number of fatal accidents is likely to rise, and the death toll could reach catastrophic levels.  By 2010, millions of new teen drivers will be on the road, including the children of the Baby Boomers.\n\nImplementing legislation to address this issue would be a straightforward process.  Schools could continue to provide driver's education classes to prepare future drivers, but no one under 18 could operate a vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued before a full license is granted, and practical driving hours would still be required.  The number of required hours could be based on the existing standards of most states, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.  Uniform national legislation would provide a reasonable and effective means of protecting teen drivers across the country.  This proposal is not a new idea, but rather a necessary step to address the alarming statistics surrounding teenage driver fatalities.",
            "While reviewing the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to examine all 15 trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films frequently rely on creative editing techniques to create illusions. My analysis primarily focused on analyzing the aesthetic principles underlying the majority of these trick films and identifying unique characteristics in a select few that deviated from the norm in later years. During this period, trick films were largely static, confined to a single set, and adhered to a strict rule of one shot per film, using a frontal proscenium composition, long shots, and no camera movement. However, some early 20th-century films broke away from these conventions by incorporating elements such as multi-shot scenes.\n\nOne distinctive trait shared by these trick films is the filming of interior scenes within a frontal proscenium framework. The camera remains stationary, never moving to follow characters or objects. This composition was a common feature in early cinema and drew inspiration from the theater and vaudeville/magic performances. A limitation of this approach is that characters typically move horizontally and do not approach or recede from the camera, as seen in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis.\n\nThe use of the frontal proscenium style also led to the prevalence of long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-up shots were never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog, a practice borrowed from the theater and vaudeville, where the audience would view the entire performance within the confines of the stage. As was common in early cinema, actors rarely moved towards the camera, making close-ups virtually non-existent.\n\nMost early trick films followed a pattern where a single conceptual shot equaled a film, limiting their length to around a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This also restricted the narrative or dramatic potential of these films, which mainly featured short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearance, and switching acts with minimal storytelling. However, it's worth noting that in trick films, a single conceptual shot may consist of multiple physical shots combined to create an illusion of disappearance or appearance. A closer inspection of The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film, reveals the moment when the physical shot containing Mary's severed head begins, even though the entire film is perceived as a single shot by the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate for Republicanism, despite primarily being an agriculturalist. His profession and brief career in politics shaped him into a dedicated and outspoken individual who prioritized personal freedom and limited government. His strong connection to an agrarian system underpinned his views on government, as he sought to preserve and promote this perceived superior career path. This emphasis on his primary occupation colored his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judiciary.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to establish an ideal system, unencumbered by native traditions that might hinder its development. He firmly believed in the natural rights of individuals, which he saw as interconnected and essential. These rights should not be subject to government interference, as their denial would undermine the entire system. He argued that the concept of a \"state of nature\" often exploited the strong and cunning, but this was not an acceptable norm in a civilized society.\n\nTo create a perfect society, Taylor argued that the government must account for both the good and evil inherent in human nature. He rigidly adhered to a dualistic morality, asserting that government, being a human institution, would inevitably reflect both its virtues and vices. He believed that good principles, such as protecting private property, promoting agriculture, and discouraging excessive capitalism, would form the foundation of a fair government. This government would function equitably, irrespective of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by self-interest and avarice. However, self-interest was only considered a vice when it led to the exploitation of others. A well-designed government was necessary to manage humanity's natural flaws and prevent the introduction of bad principles.\n\nLike many Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, advocating for a limited federal government with powers explicitly stated in the document. He recognized that a broad federal government would be expensive and potentially tyrannical. However, he also believed that a literal interpretation without consideration for the Founding Fathers' intent could be misleading and prone to corruption. Furthermore, Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defined the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking at Figure 17, we can see a significant drop in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project, which was somewhat concerning. The reasons behind this decline are unclear, but several factors might have contributed. At our New England campus, the onset of winter often results in fewer people commuting by bike or on foot. Additionally, the end of the fall semester in December means students and faculty are preoccupied with finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and other tasks, which may have pushed the commuter log to the backburner. Furthermore, December marks the start of the holiday season, leading to a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many don't need to come to campus. When classes resume in late January, the number of log submissions remained low, suggesting a possible connection. However, the numbers for February were even lower, leaving the reason for this decline unclear. It's possible that initial enthusiasm for the project naturally waned over time, which is a common phenomenon in such initiatives. To counteract this, we organized the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign to revitalize the project, which led to an increase in log submissions. \n\nOne of the challenges we faced with this project is that people generally enjoy the freedom and flexibility of driving their cars, a deeply ingrained aspect of our culture. To encourage alternative commuting methods, we offered prizes in the form of gift cards to local businesses. While this was a successful strategy, it would have been interesting to see the impact of offering larger prizes, such as a new bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have helped sustain the project's momentum, particularly during the dip in engagement we experienced. The value of the prizes remained constant throughout the project, which may have contributed to the decline in participation. If the prizes had been increased over time, with the addition of more substantial rewards in December and January, it's likely that participation and engagement would have increased instead of decreased.",
            "A security known as an exchange-traded fund (ETF) is designed to track an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund, while being more flexible and traded like a stock on an exchange.  ETFs offer the diversification benefits of an index fund and the advantages of owning individual stocks, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as few as one share per transaction.  Although these benefits are highly appealing, ETFs have significantly lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund.  However, there are some drawbacks, including the cost of paying a commission on any ETF trade, similar to paying for a stock order.  Additionally, ETFs offer a wide variety of funds to choose from.  It is essential for the astute financial investor to critically evaluate whether the stated benefits, such as diversification, are indeed present and to what extent they exist.  For the purposes of this analysis, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it to its top 10 holdings to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF are comparable to those of a diversified portfolio of the same 10 stocks, as well as whether there are more optimal configurations of the same stocks that could provide a better risk-return ratio.\n\nTo make the evaluation manageable, we have decided to focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's total assets.  Below are the top 10 holdings and their respective percentages of total assets.\n\nTo gauge how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, to estimate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio consisted entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF's holdings.  The calculations of Beta and Return are presented in the chart below.\n\nFrom the data in the chart, it is clear that a portfolio consisting solely of the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  The results thus far suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could offer higher returns with a lower risk.  Nevertheless, it is possible that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\nTo determine whether these portfolios are statistically different, we have calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% for comparison to the ETF IHF's accumulated standard deviation.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's notable poems is \"Dream-Land,\" in which he prominently features the term \"Thulé.\" Poe's use of this term can be linked to Virgil, who mentioned an island north of Britain as the edge of the known world. However, Poe's inspiration for Thulé may also have been influenced by German literature, which he was known to be interested in. \n\nA notable example of Poe's familiarity with German authors, including Goethe, can be seen in the similarity between their works. Karl J. Arndt notes the resemblance between \"Poe's Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon,\" suggesting that Poe may have been drawing inspiration from Goethe. \n\nAccording to the Oxford Companion to English Literature, Goethe's work \"Faust\" is a celebrated poetic drama that was published in two parts in 1808 and 1832. Within the second part, there is a poem called \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells the story of a king who is consumed by grief after the loss of his wife. This poem bears a striking resemblance to the character in Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" with both featuring a sense of despair and a reliance on drinking to cope with emotional pain.\n\nInterestingly, Goethe's \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term Thulé in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe references Thulé twice in his collected works, using the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and incorporating it as a bookend in \"Dream-Land.\" The parallels between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" suggest that they can be read as companion pieces, with both exploring themes of loss and loneliness. \n\nGiven Poe's admiration for Tennyson and the widespread reproduction of Goethe's work, it is likely that Poe was familiar with Goethe's writing, which suggests that he may have drawn inspiration from \"The King of Thulé\" when creating his own \"Dream-Land.\"",
            "In California, if a customer suffered an injury after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store, they may be eligible for punitive damages if the store manager acted with malicious intent. A court is unlikely to immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To justify an award of punitive damages, a plaintiff must provide evidence that the defendant's actions were taken with a reckless disregard for the potential harm that could result from their behavior, as well as that the conduct itself was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have anticipated the potential harm of not cleaning the spill, given that multiple customers had previously slipped and fallen in the store in the months leading up to her accident. She will also argue that Martin's failure to have the spill cleaned, despite being aware of the potential risks, demonstrates a willful and conscious disregard for customer safety. While Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable is not as strong, it is still a reasonable claim, especially considering that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009 and Martin failed to take adequate measures to ensure store safety. \n\nOn October 13th, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee of D&D Markets, Rich Wayne, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin responded by stating he was on dinner break and unavailable to deal with customer complaints. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin of the spill, and he gave the same response. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, suffering a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, there had been five reported slip-and-fall incidents at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment on the punitive damage claim. \n\nIn California law, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not based on a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" California Civil Code section 3294(a) defines malice as conduct that was intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when it was committed with a deliberate disregard of the plaintiff's rights when the defendant was aware of the potential dangerous consequences of their actions and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences, as seen in the case of Taylor v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County, 598 P.2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "It has been almost four years since I took a course in Islam at CBC, where one of the most debated topics was whether Islam is inherently hostile. In my opinion, this question remains highly relevant today, particularly when considering the shift in mass media's perception of Islam and extremists since 9/11.  What's striking is the transformation from a hostile view to an extreme level of tolerance for Islam in America. This shift is exemplified by the fact that in 2001, it would have been unimaginable to have a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, who has a clear Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad fascinates me. Contrary to my previous understanding of his history, the biography depicts him as a humble martyr rather than a conqueror who forced conversions to Islam. According to my initial knowledge, Muhammad was known to conquer and assimilate tribes, forcing them to adopt Islam. However, the biography portrays him as a leader who was often misunderstood, and his humility eventually won over those who came to understand his message.\n\nI've also noticed eerie similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles attributed to Muhammad. One notable example is when Muhammad miraculously multiplied mutton and milk to feed a large group of people. This narrative style suggests that the authors aimed to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove himself but lived a life of truth and miracles. This approach downplays the significance of Jesus' life and ministry, almost as if they're borrowing and attempting to supplant the essence of Jesus' personhood with Muhammad's story.\n\nThe biography also contains numerous accounts that appear to be intended to provide evidence of the 'witness' or 'conversion' of individuals to Islam. However, many of these stories are presented from a third-party perspective, which undermines their credibility. The stories often originate from hearsay, making it seem suspicious and diminishing their impact.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the attempt to portray Muhammad as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle figure. However, historical records contradict this image of Muhammad, leading me to wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true circumstances surrounding his rise to power.",
            "The core teachings of Jesus and the ideals he promoted during his lifetime were initially overlooked as Christianity evolved beyond his era.  When examining the history of Christianity, we observe a pattern where the faith has gradually strayed further away from its roots.  Today, society is witnessing an increasing awareness and a progressive shift towards a more refined understanding.  While traditionalists continue to hold onto their conventional views and resist any departure from established teachings, their influence may not be substantial enough to dictate the broader direction.  As the years pass, a growing awareness of historical context among Christians will emerge, sparking a desire to distinguish between the original intent of Jesus' teachings and the additional doctrines that were incorporated over time.  This process may take centuries, but it is inevitable that Christianity will eventually undergo a significant reversal, returning to its original form.  As this trend spreads across the United States and Europe, it will inspire a movement to strip away the layers of doctrine, gradually stripping back to the essence of Jesus' message, as it was presented before other thinkers and interpretations took hold.  When this shift affects the masses in these regions, the church as an institution will still maintain its strength, guiding the way forward.  As a result of this reversal, the extreme diversity within Christianity will give way to increased uniformity of belief and practice.  The distinctions between regions, denominations, and other divisions will be replaced by growing similarities.  History is replete with examples of reversals, such as the Roman Empire's shift from persecution to Christian dominance, or the transformation of the United States from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The impending reversal in Christianity will unfold in a similar manner, as the faith seeks to reclaim its roots and, in the process, reduces diversity.  It is essential to note that a key factor in making this reversal possible will be the adoption of a more metaphorical interpretation of Jesus' words, rather than viewing them as literal statements of fact.  To understand the trajectory of Christianity, it is necessary to look back to its origins in Judaism, which was the theological foundation of the Christian faith.  By examining the period before the Roman Empire's control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., we find that Judaism was characterized by a rich diversity of perspectives, with the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and ordinary people each holding distinct views.",
            "The Jungle highlights the inherent self-centered nature of human beings. At their core, people prioritize their own interests over others and seek to improve their lives at the expense of those around them. This is exemplified in the factory owners and managers of Packingtown, who are only driven by the desire to expand their businesses and accumulate wealth, disregarding the impact on the environment and those affected by their operations. Upton Sinclair vividly illustrates this in his description of the factories: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This image serves as a stark representation of the devastating consequences of their actions, such as pollution and environmental degradation. The owners and managers display a callous disregard for the well-being of their employees, using them as mere means to an end. They exploit their workers, pushing them to work excessively long hours and laying them off without warning or support, all in pursuit of profit. During the time period depicted in the novel, there were few laws or regulations protecting workers' safety and well-being, allowing the factory owners and managers to operate with impunity. The workers in Packingtown were expected to endure deplorable working conditions and treatment, with no access to information or assistance. Although some unions formed to represent the workers, they often profited from their struggles, making the situation even more dire. The workers were described as being in a state of servitude, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many authors employ various techniques to evoke specific feelings or attitudes in their readers towards essential subjects. Some of these methods are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes a range of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. He frequently employs an uncommon combination of adjectives and nouns to create a distinct atmosphere surrounding a subject. Alternatively, he assigns meaning to a symbol and later utilizes it to achieve a particular effect. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald develops and utilizes the meaning of several colors, including gold, green, white, and red/pink, to convey specific emotions and ideas.\n\nFitzgerald creates associations for colors such as white/gray and red/pink, and then leverages these meanings to create a particular impression of an object. The meaning he assigns to white/gray is uniformity, with white representing a more refined and upper-class atmosphere, while gray implies something older and faded. To establish this meaning, Fitzgerald consistently uses both colors in the novel's beginning. White is repeatedly associated with characters such as Daisy and Jordan, who are often depicted wearing white. For instance, Nick wears \"white flannels\" to Gatsby's party, and Tom wears a \"white shirt\" when meeting Myrtle. Fitzgerald reinforces this connection by describing mundane, unimportant subjects with these colors, such as the \"white chasms of lower New York\" and the \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable.\n\nFitzgerald further develops this meaning by applying these colors to common or unremarkable people and places. He describes Jordan and Daisy's past as a \"white girlhood,\" and the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes. The dog-seller is portrayed as a \"gray old man.\" After establishing these associations, Fitzgerald uses white/gray to signify a sense of uniformity or lack of importance. This technique is first employed when describing Daisy. After a period of limited use of these colors, Fitzgerald reintroduces Daisy dressed in white, which contributes to her characterization as a uniform, interchangeable entity, something Gatsby desires but also longs for. He repeats this technique to reinforce this impression, using images such as a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and her appearance in a \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County boasts significant agricultural output, primarily due to its favorable climate characterized by mild temperatures and ample sunlight. The region's agricultural sector includes a wide variety of crops such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial demand for locally sourced, organic produce in the area, with many community-supported agriculture initiatives having lengthy waiting lists for their products. Organic dairy and poultry products are also in high demand. Many local farms provide opportunities for visitors to explore their operations, as well as engage in recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching. By adopting organic farming practices, landowners can take advantage of government incentives while enhancing biodiversity, creating opportunities for ecotourism, and generating revenue through educational programs.\n\nIn addition to catering to a potentially lucrative market niche, organic farming often leads to increased biodiversity in the area due to the absence of chemical usage. However, organic farming can be more labor-intensive and costly than conventional methods, particularly when it comes to pest control and soil fertilization. Additionally, small organic farms often lack the efficiency and economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations. Other conservation practices, unrelated to organic farming, can also incur higher labor costs, including the use of cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to create specific habitats.\n\nA hypothetical landowner in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expert guidance to optimize both profit and habitat quality. \n\nThe hypothetical land in question is located adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California, and spans 160 acres of chaparral, non-native grasslands, and oak woodlands, situated next to the Cleveland National Forest. This area falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered or threatened with listing, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nHistorically, this region was inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 19th century. The land in question was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and/or wood production over the intervening decades.\n\nTo provide a realistic example of a farming operation in this area, I selected a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to determine the options available to small-scale farmers for reducing costs and preserving wildlife-friendly practices. I also identified an organic farm in the same region as a model for what a landowner might aim to achieve.",
            "In negotiations, understanding and accounting for cultural differences is crucial. Culture encompasses a wide range of nuances that cannot be defined by a single characteristic or trait. Stereotypes, such as \"Russians are stubborn\" or \"Japanese are accommodating,\" oversimplify the complexities of a culture and are often inaccurate. A more effective approach is to comprehend the specific cultural values and attitudes relevant to the negotiation at hand, as they can significantly impact the dynamic at the bargaining table. When interacting with a foreign culture, one tends to draw comparisons to their own, which can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nTo navigate cultural differences, it is essential to delve into the culture, its history, and values, rather than judging or trying to alter them. Acceptance and understanding of the culture, particularly when dealing with a weaker bargaining position, can facilitate a smoother negotiation. When on unfamiliar territory, respecting local customs and traditions can help break down cultural barriers and facilitate progress.\n\nIt is essential to recognize that culture extends beyond national or international boundaries. Companies within a nation develop their unique corporate cultures, shaped by factors such as work hours, communication styles, hiring practices, and dress codes. These differences can be observed within a single nation, as seen in the varying corporate cultures across the United States. The apparent uniformity of certain cultures can be misleading, and it is crucial to look beyond the surface to uncover the complexities.\n\nUnderstanding a culture's values is particularly vital, as they provide insight into the underlying motivations and priorities. For instance, in cultures where saving face or communal harmony is valued, a negotiator will avoid publicly embarrassing their company or superior. On the other hand, in cultures that prioritize a hard-driven bargain, negotiators may be more likely to push for a favorable deal. Considering these cultural factors beforehand can significantly enhance the effectiveness of a negotiation. Nevertheless, gaining a deeper understanding of one's counterpart on a personal level can also be invaluable in achieving a successful negotiation.",
            "The famous phrase \"The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" originates in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is at the forefront of St. Anselm's argument for God's existence. This notion is also shared by Thomas Aquinas. Since both authors defend the same concept, it's essential to assume they are correct in their belief in the God of the Bible for the sake of comparison. If we were to consider a deity that differs from the one in whom our authors believe, we wouldn't be able to properly compare their arguments, as they are fundamentally centered around a specific idea of God. \n\nWhile each author presents valid points, neither provides a comprehensive foundation for believing in God. To demonstrate this, let's first examine St. Anselm's argument. Anselm's reasoning relies on gaining understanding through faith, exploring one's own consciousness to find proof of God. He suggests that God's existence is inherent within our understanding, making it impossible to conceive of his nonexistence. Although the specifics of Anselm's argument can be wordy and confusing, the core idea is that the proof for God lies within our minds and doesn't necessitate any external evidence. This concept of accepting something without definitive empirical proof is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas proposes that God's existence can be proven solely through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith altogether. This approach would be advantageous in evangelism, a crucial aspect of Christianity, as it would enable the recruitment of new followers without relying on their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. Instead, Aquinas employs logical arguments based on change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony to demonstrate the logical necessity of God's existence. He illustrates that understanding the characteristics of a missing puzzle piece is possible through the assembly of the rest of the puzzle, even if the piece itself is not visible.",
            "It is believed that around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince destined to be known as the Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he renounced worldly life and achieved enlightenment, which led to the establishment of Buddhism, specifically the Theravada tradition. Although the religion is now over 2,500 years old, it has undergone significant changes, as seen in countries like Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. This event, attended by both monks and laypeople, holds spiritual significance, despite the Buddha never mentioning a similar celebration. These changes can be observed in both the surface-level customs and the core teachings of Buddhism. The Theravada Buddhist community has adapted its core principles over time, influenced by both internal and external forces, which may be either hostile or benevolent.\n\nTo facilitate this discussion, it is essential to understand the concepts of internal and external forces. An internal force refers to influences stemming from within the Buddhist community, regardless of the individual's monastic status, whereas an external force originates from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any influence that damages or seeks to damage the Buddhist community, often driven by a negative perception of Buddhism. In contrast, a benign force does not intend to harm or help the community but may inadvertently cause either outcome. These terms will be used throughout this analysis.\n\nTo begin, it is crucial to explore the fundamental principles of Theravada Buddhism. Adherents seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, encompassing the Tripitaka, consists of three baskets of Buddhist scriptures: the Sutta Pitaka, containing the teachings; the Vinaya Pitaka, outlining disciplinary rules; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, delving into metaphysical concepts. These concepts include the notions of Anatta (no permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these principles is essential to escaping Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, and ultimately overcoming the afflictions of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), which are characteristic of a state of enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth guidelines for Buddhist adherents, with laypeople adhering to five precepts and monks following a more extensive set of disciplinary rules. The four noble truths are the fundamental teachings of Buddhism: the acknowledgment of Dukkha (suffering is inherent in life), the causal relationship between attachment and suffering, and the possibility of overcoming suffering.",
            "The United States and Mexico provide a notable example of two nations that were embroiled in a prolonged rivalry spanning 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. This rivalry peaked during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, in which the United States defeated Mexico and secured control over Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Over the course of their relationship, the two nations experienced numerous conflicts, which gradually subsided before the onset of World War I. The initial tensions arose from fundamental differences in their values, cultural practices, and traditions, as well as conflicting material interests. \n\nSimilarities can be drawn with other countries that share a border, as these nations often experience clashes of interests, leading to the development of rival positions. The United States and Mexico's relationship is not unique in this regard, with David M. Pletcher commenting that \"only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-standing American diplomatic challenges\" (Pletcher, 1977, p. 41). Their geographical proximity to the United States, in addition to historical rivalries, contributed to their tumultuous relationship. In contrast, many other Latin American nations have maintained positive relations with the United States.\n\nThe discord between the two nations was also fueled by differences in their religious beliefs, which have been a source of conflict in many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm noted that Americans' opposition to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries was a significant factor in their relationship with Mexico (Frahm, 2001, p. 86). This ideological divide mirrored the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, which was characterized by a mix of ideological and interest-driven competition. However, the United States and Mexico's rivalry was rooted in their differing religious preferences, rather than their political systems. The animosity between the two nations was, in part, inherited from the distrust between their former colonial rulers, the English and Spanish, which hindered the establishment of amicable diplomatic relations.\n\nAccording to Diehl and Goerts (2000), 17 disputes arose between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry period. Most of these disputes involved territorial issues, such as Mexican raids into U.S. territory and border problems. The presence of bandits and outlaws from American border towns posed a significant challenge, which was eventually addressed through joint military action by both nations (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97). \n\nSchmitt (1974) explained that the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became increasingly reliant on the United States and, eventually, as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico, marking the end of the rivalry in the late 19th century.",
            "It has been fifteen years since I was unexpectedly disabled by an illness that I was unaware of. At the time, I was a nurse, a profession I chose to pursue in response to the uncertainty and insecurity I experienced during my childhood. The notion that one could always find work because people would inevitably fall ill was a mantra that resonated with me. Although my true aspirations lay in becoming a scientist or journalist, I opted for nursing as a more stable career path.\n\nHowever, I found myself at a crossroads at the age of 46, with no savings and no ability to work. Fifteen years of living on Social Security Disability have left me with nothing to call my own. Each day is a struggle, and I face challenges to my sense of security, safety, and self-esteem. One thing that I am certain of is that without the support of my family and a few close friends, I would not have been able to survive these years, regardless of my strength. In reality, when adversity strikes, one's sense of strength is often greatly diminished.\n\nMy point is that life is inherently unpredictable, and emergencies – big or small – will inevitably arise. No amount of preparation can guarantee a smooth ride, and some challenges are too overwhelming to face alone.\n\nWhile I agree that Americans should not rely too heavily on big government, I believe that fostering a culture of mutual trust and assistance would be a more desirable approach. Rather than relying solely on individual efforts to prepare for disasters, I advocate for Americans to learn from one another, to offer help when needed, and to ask for help without hesitation. This approach is reminiscent of the values that truly sustained our ancestors during difficult times – compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources.\n\nThe idea of rugged individualism, touted by some Conservatives as a driving force behind the country's success, is a myth. In reality, it was our forefathers' ability to come together, show compassion, and share resources that helped them overcome hardships. The pioneers who traversed the Rockies in wagon trains did not achieve their goal in isolation; it was through collective effort and support.\n\nI, too, believe in being prepared for emergencies. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, and other essential items to ensure my safety in case of a crisis. If possible, having a small farm with a wood stove and the ability to preserve food can be a great asset. However, this is not a substitute for building a support network of neighbors who can offer aid when needed. Therefore, it is essential to get to know those around you and build relationships that can provide a sense of security and community in times of need.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in a particular manner remains a topic of interest, and it is unclear if there are any restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change.  Even in the early 20th century, D'Arcy Thompson noted that biologists were still struggling to mathematically describe even the simplest organic forms.  However, more recently, researchers have applied mathematical modeling to the development and evolution of mollusk skeletons, covering both their development from birth (ontogeny) and their evolutionary history (phylogeny). Our study aims to investigate how combining mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum with experimental studies can help reveal the underlying mechanisms driving the direction and magnitude of evolutionary developmental changes. By analyzing X-radiographic images of Prunum species, we identified quantitative parameters that can be used to model both hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were fed into the software program CerioShell to simulate various shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. We are integrating these findings with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a better understanding of major evolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a tube that travels through space over time, making 360-degree turns as it grows. These turns, known as whorls, are thought to spiral around an imaginary central axis called the columella, which runs through the shell's central column. The rate at which the whorls expand can vary, and a continuous line separating each whorl is referred to as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl (the body whorl) is the last one formed. The spire consists of all the whorls except the last one. The apex is the tip of the spire, while the opposite end is the base. The animal exits its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various angles, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The typical orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count the whorls, the shell should first be viewed from the apical perspective, and then the first suture should be identified. A line can be drawn to divide the shell into two parts, and whorls are counted from this line, estimating them to a quarter of a whorl if necessary.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of openings that move through time and space as the animal grows and builds its shell. It is possible to track the path of the aperture by measuring the coordinates of the center of each whorl's opening, as well as its horizontal and vertical radius. This trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. By developing a mathematical formulation, it becomes possible to modify parameters and alter the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Despite a decade of relative stagnation in neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia, the country still has a long way to go to meet its Millennium Development Goals, particularly in child and maternal health.  Although progress has been made in several areas, such as water and sanitation, the country's health system struggles to make significant improvements in these areas.  This points to a need to strengthen the overall health system rather than focusing solely on targeted programs.\n\nIndonesia has made some progress in increasing the number of skilled healthcare workers attending births, with 72% of births now meeting this standard.  However, this statistic includes traditional birth attendants who may not have the necessary medical training to handle complications, contributing to a high number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage.  Thus, these improvements may be misleading, and more work is needed.  Additionally, the percentage of children under five treated by a healthcare professional for diarrheal illnesses has decreased, and data on postnatal care is incomplete, revealing concerns in these areas. \n\nThe low cesarean-section rate of 4% indicates a lack of access to specialized medical care, with a significant disparity between urban and rural areas.  In urban settings, the c-section rate is 7%, while it is only 2% in rural areas, highlighting the disparity in access to healthcare services.  Furthermore, a 27% gap in service utilization exists between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the poor face significant barriers in accessing healthcare due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering ways to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the key question is how to effectively address the shortage of healthcare services.  The main issue is whether Indonesia should focus on developing targeted programs or strengthening its overall health system, rather than solely addressing pre and post-pregnancy care.  While program-specific approaches may yield faster results and have more manageable objectives, they also have drawbacks.  Investing heavily in one area of the health sector can divert resources and personnel away from other areas, leading to duplication of services and inefficiencies.  This can result in unnecessary administrative burdens and waste of resources.",
            "Victorian novels are characterized by their meticulous attention to detail and focus on the aristocracy of the time period. However, novels such as Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights diverge from this tradition. These two works incorporate an element of mystery and a distinct flair for the unusual, characteristics not typically found in novels of the era. This emphasis on the unknown strengthens the characters within the narrative, offering a deeper understanding of their motivations and emotions.\n\nIn the midst of turmoil, a character's mind becomes flooded with a multitude of confusing ideas and images. As seen in the passage from Dickens, a character's perception of reality becomes distorted, with fragmented scenes unfolding before their eyes. This disorienting experience is characterized by the blending of reality and fantasy, leaving the character with an intense sense of unease and discomfort.\n\nIn Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, the authors frequently employ dream sequences or dream-like states to convey the inner workings of the characters' minds. These surreal episodes often reveal the characters' deepest fears, insecurities, and desires. For instance, Oliver Twist's hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit serve as a manifestation of his inner turmoil and desperation. When Oliver relives the shooting scene in chapter 28, he is overwhelmed by a sense of helplessness and despair, highlighting his lack of control over the events unfolding around him. This portrayal underscores the theme of Oliver's powerlessness, as he is unable to influence the outcome of events, even when his life is at stake.\n\nFurthermore, the recurring theme of defeat and hopelessness is a significant aspect of Oliver's character development. His inability to take control of his circumstances, despite being faced with dire consequences, suggests that he has become resigned to his fate, allowing Fagin's influence to shape his actions and reactions.\n\nIn the same vein, the passage from Dickens continues to convey the theme of despair and hopelessness. The protagonist's perception of time becomes distorted, with days passing by in an instant, while the nights seem interminably long and filled with a sense of foreboding. The contrast between the fleeting nature of time and the eternal duration of the protagonist's suffering serves to heighten the sense of hopelessness and desperation.",
            "About two years ago, I was working in an after-school program where I tutored elementary school students in various subjects. I focused on helping them with their struggles in English and reading, as these were my areas of expertise. However, I was approached by one of the instructors to work with a third or fourth-grader named Adrian, who was facing significant difficulties with reading. As I worked with him, I realized that something was amiss; he had a peculiar reading problem, where he could effortlessly pronounce some letters, but struggled with others. This was quite unusual, especially considering that Adrian's mother spoke only Spanish, yet he spoke flawless English. It wasn't until I met his mother that the issue became clear: Adrian could read, but he had a weak understanding of the English alphabet. Although I'm not sure if this realization significantly impacted his reading abilities, I hope he has made progress since then.\n\nI share this anecdote to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, particularly in California. My story also serves to illustrate that this problem may not always be as apparent as we assume, even for students who speak perfect English, reading can still be a significant challenge. The situation with Adrian's mother made me realize that the solution to this issue is not as straightforward as it seems. While a simple approach like tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation, might work for some, it is not a universal solution for students whose first language is not English.\n\nIn my opinion, the key to addressing this complex issue lies in combining multiple strategies. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes, among others, are not mutually exclusive and can be used in conjunction with one another. In fact, combining these approaches can lead to better outcomes.\n\nThe dual language system, for instance, has been shown to be highly effective, not only for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Research indicates that students in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Despite the common misconception that this approach is a waste of resources, studies have shown that it benefits the majority of students, not just a select few. If we were to adopt this approach as a standard rather than an exception, all students would reap the benefits. However, implementing this system would require some adjustments, such as providing bilingual support staff, rather than expecting all teachers to be fluent in multiple languages. This would not only be impractical but also unrealistic. Nevertheless, I believe that having bilingual support staff or tutors can make a significant difference in helping students overcome language barriers.",
            "As children, many of us are taught that there exists something beyond our comprehension, something greater than ourselves.  This concept can be learned in various settings, such as Sunday school or through personal reflection.  While some people adhere to the faith passed down to them by their families, others refuse to accept any notion of a higher power, instead embracing a self-centered worldview.  It is common for individuals to adopt one set of values, only to later change and adopt another.  Our pursuit of spirituality serves as a means to understand ourselves and our place in the world.  We seek guidance, a beacon of hope, to lead us out of darkness and into the light.\n\nIn a moment of quiet contemplation on our front porch, my father shared with me his favorite type of bird, the cardinal, while the sound of rain pounded against the tin roof above us.  His frail appearance, brought on by recent health struggles, was a stark contrast to his former robust self.  As he gazed out into the rain, I felt a deep sense of unease and a longing to talk to him about my impending loss, but I knew that acknowledging it would only make the reality more painful for both of us.  I found solace in our shared silence, and I drew closer to him, sitting beside him as we both looked out into the rain.\n\nMy father's passing occurred five days after my twenty-second birthday in December.  Despite the medical treatments that prolonged his life beyond the expected period, his suffering persisted.  I found myself questioning a higher power, wondering if it existed at all and, if so, whether it had abandoned me.  In the stillness of night, I chose not to pray, as I felt that any divine being had long since stopped listening to my pleas.\n\nI had not wanted to witness his transition from life to death, so I chose not to be there.  I couldn't bear to see the person who had given me life slipping away.  Instead, I chose to remember him through his life, not his passing.  I knew him better than anyone, and I believed that he would not have wanted me to be present at his death.  I spent three days in solitude, waiting for news of his passing.  Unfortunately, I was not even contacted during that time.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is itself an oxymoron, as described by Ian Watt in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, combining the concepts of \"old\" and \"new.\" The Gothic genre has been subject to diverse opinions, ranging from criticism for lacking depth to praise for evoking a sense of the \"terrible sublime.\" The pioneering work, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, drew upon both ancient and modern romance elements to establish the proto-Gothic genre and create a new style of literary expression. By blending old theatrical elements with the modern novel's format, Walpole presented \"A Gothic Story\" that appealed to a unique blend of past and present.\n\nThe Gothic genre heavily draws from medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions, which were already perceived as archaic and unsophisticated in comparison to modern societal and literary advancements at the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication. However, it was the combination of the dramatic, theatrical aspects of the Gothic with the novel's ability to offer a personal insight into character psychology that allowed the genre to endure and become both timeless and innovative to readers separated from the original writing by time.\n\nOne of the key features of Gothic literature is the romanticization of the concept of Chivalry. In The Castle of Otranto, the medieval idea of chivalry, which involves the training of a noble knight, is both preserved and transformed. This theme holds significant importance in Gothic literature because it represents the idealized image of a brave, honorable, and capable knight, and the perceived lack of such qualities in the authors' contemporary society. By employing chivalric concepts and ideals, the Gothic past is idealized and romanticized, foreshadowing the evolution of Gothic into Romantic literature. \n\nThe author, Horace Walpole, wrote The Castle of Otranto during a time of social turmoil, and his writing reflects his concerns about the apparent decline of moral values and innate goodness in society. This is evident in the character of Frederic, a prince who embodies many chivalric traits. The description of Frederic as a prince who has suffered, been affected by tragedy, and is said to have been killed by infidels, exemplifies the exaggerated image of the gallant and courteous knight that is characteristic of the Gothic genre.",
            "Supply chain management is the intricate network of processes involved in moving goods from the initial customer order to the final delivery of products to customers. The concept of supply chain management was first introduced by Keith Oliver in 1982, a renowned consultant who outlined the essential components of effective supply chain management, encompassing planning, implementation, and control to meet customer needs efficiently. The core elements of a supply chain include production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information, which business managers utilize to deliver exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction is the foundation of the supply chain process, requiring careful planning of 'when', 'why', 'where', and 'how' products will be manufactured. To achieve this, managers need to understand customer requirements, which can be determined by analyzing market trends. This analysis enables managers to decide on the products to be produced, their quantities, production locations, and optimal production volume to meet customer demands. Scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment are critical tasks to be addressed during this stage, as every detail plays a vital role in the overall efficiency of the process. A well-planned production process, like the ones adopted by companies such as Wal-Mart and Target, ensures a smooth operation, minimizing confusion and miscommunication.\n\nSupply is another crucial element in supply chain management, involving strategic decisions that define a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. This may involve allocating different production divisions to specific tasks, leveraging their unique equipment, workers, and specialties. Alternatively, management may opt to outsource certain processes to other companies to achieve velocity, which means providing quality products while maintaining low costs by enhancing flexibility and efficiency.",
            "The sign on the street corner, held up by Ellen Page, reads, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" The juxtaposition of this message with the image of the actress, who starred in the film Juno, is striking. Burma, now known as Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia that has been ruled by a repressive military regime since a coup in 1962. In 2007, a wave of protests swept the country, known as the \"Saffron Revolution,\" which was led by Buddhist monks who wore saffron-colored robes. The protests, which began peacefully, soon turned violent as the government cracked down on the monks and their supporters. Journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai, were arrested and killed while covering the protests. Estimates of the death toll vary, but one colonel who defected from the military claimed that the true number of deaths was in the thousands. \n\nThis is not an isolated incident. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain control over their citizens. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine authority, while Japanese emperors were believed to be gods. Even in modern times, leaders have used various means to silence opposition, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, and the atrocities committed during Hitler's \"Third Reich.\" These examples highlight the enduring pattern of governments using force to maintain power and silence dissent.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on jazz is largely due to his remarkable career longevity and his ability to showcase his orchestra's individual talents through his creative genius. Although his piano presence is often understated in many compositions, Ellington excelled as a composer, crafting intricate and complex pieces that highlighted the unique abilities of each band member. As a master composer, he skillfully created frameworks that allowed soloists to improvise freely while writing tightly orchestrated pieces that emphasized the distinctive styles of individual members. This approach not only showcased the orchestra's cohesive sound but also enabled Ellington to produce some of the most groundbreaking pieces in the history of jazz.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative use of voice as a musical instrument throughout his career, exemplified by Creole Love Call, an early piece that incorporated vocals to add texture and depth without lyrics. This 12-bar blues piece demonstrates Ellington's ability to complement the styles of his soloists, a trait evident throughout his work. The composition features six distinct choruses, each showcasing a unique aspect of the band's sound:\n\nThe first chorus features a call-and-response dialogue between voice and reeds, with the voice transitioning from smooth to rough. The second chorus features a muted trumpet solo elaborating on the melody and emphasizing extended blue notes. The third chorus features a sweeping clarinet solo in a high register accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase. The fourth chorus is a full-band rendition of the first chorus, with a call-and-response between brass and reed sections. The fifth chorus is the climactic point of the piece, with reeds taking the lead and syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections. The final chorus returns to the first chorus's structure, with the voice adopting a growl technique and soloing as an instrument. The piece concludes with a brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice as a tone-color instrument is a recurring theme throughout his work, as seen in pieces like Creole Love Call. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his orchestration skills with his sensitivity to tone color, using a call-and-response phrase between Bubber Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing to create a rich and complementary sound. In It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington leverages Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's talents as a trombonist to great effect, introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "She had long harbored an unfulfilled longing, a sense of emptiness that persisted since her early teenage years. By the time she turned 17, she had become convinced that the solution lay in finding a romantic partner, yet she found herself uninterested in the boys who had shown interest in her. Her introspection had led to various theories, but none had seemed satisfactory. Her life was a continuous cycle of questioning her desires.\n\nOrdinarily, her home was a peaceful haven, with her parents maintaining a calm atmosphere, and disagreements with her being a rare occurrence. Her parents valued her independence and lively personality, which complemented their own tranquil nature. However, today was an exception. As she searched for inspiration, she was startled by her mother's anguished cry from the kitchen. She rushed in to find her mother lying on the ground, in obvious pain, and repeatedly saying \"Ow.\" With growing panic, her daughter rushed to her side and offered assistance. \"Ouch... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother gasped. The daughter quickly assessed the situation and helped her mother get into the car.\n\nUpon arriving at the hospital, the daughter was surrounded by the harsh smells of disinfectant and illness mixed with an air of concern. But her focus remained on her mother's well-being. She quickly helped her mother onto a rolling bed and called for medical assistance. The doctors and nurses rushed to her side, and her daughter was left to anxiously wait. \n\nIt turned out that her mother had slipped off a step stool while trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to identify a connection between adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, reflected by a high alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score, and a reduced risk of heart disease and stroke, as well as stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet, an adaptation of the traditional Mediterranean diet, emphasizes the consumption of plant-based foods, including fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, and plant-based proteins (excluding potatoes), along with higher intakes of monounsaturated fats and fish, while limiting animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is also permitted.\n\nPrevious studies had found an inverse link between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and total and cardiovascular mortality. Furthermore, a clinical trial demonstrated that the Mediterranean diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving the cholesterol ratio in obese individuals. However, prior research did not specifically examine the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis observational study tracked 74,886 middle-aged women without a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, who were participants in a larger cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. An aMed diet score was computed from self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) six times between 1984 and 2004, assessing nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of nurses maintained their participation throughout the 20-year study period. The accuracy of FFQs was validated, and reports of heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke were confirmed through medical records, hospital records, or death certificates. Cases where records were unavailable were classified as \"probable\" and included in the analysis, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal heart attacks falling into this category. Additional factors, including body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone replacement therapy, were also calculated for each FFQ. Starting in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo account for individual variations and better represent long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two prior years). Potential confounding factors were adjusted for, including age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe study employed Cox proportional-hazard modeling to investigate the association between the aMed score and the risk of heart disease and stroke, using separate models for fatal and non-fatal heart disease and stroke types.\n\nThe findings showed that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal heart disease and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk of both heart disease and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk, 0.71).",
            "The United States faced a severe financial crisis in 2007, marked by soaring unemployment, a collapsed housing market, and numerous prominent corporations on the brink of collapse. This ongoing economic downturn has prompted the question: what led to this crisis, and how can we prevent it? In essence, the financial crisis was triggered by shortsighted and reckless policy decisions that forced banks and companies to issue high-risk sub-prime loans to an underdeveloped financial system. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, tasked with underwriting and repackaging these mortgages into complex financial instruments, further exacerbated the problem. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks struggled to maintain their capital reserves, leading to a chain reaction that spread financial chaos throughout the economy.\n\nThe roots of the crisis date back to 1999, when the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions in a bid to boost the President's popularity. This decision laid the groundwork for the sub-prime crisis that unfolded seven years later. In 1999, New York Times journalist Steven Holmes sounded a warning about the potential consequences of this policy: Fannie Mae, the largest mortgage underwriter in the country, faced pressure from the government to expand its lending to low- and moderate-income households, and from shareholders to maintain its profit margins. Holmes foresaw the possibility of a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\n\nA combination of factors contributed to the economic turmoil, including the proliferation of complex mortgage products such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These instruments deeply entangled various sectors of the economy with the housing market, leaving households and financial institutions heavily exposed to even minor fluctuations in housing prices. As a result, the housing market bubble burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities reeling. In 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, equivalent to approximately 30% of the country's GDP. The crisis ultimately led to the sale of Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch at fire-sale prices, the dismantling of Lehman Brothers, and the forced transformation of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley into commercial banks subject to strict regulation. Fannie and Freddie, burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "The infamous exposition - a part of storytelling where writers often struggle to strike the right balance between drawing readers in and overwhelming them with unnecessary details.  It's the moment when you spread your creative wings, only to risk sending your audience to sleep or reaching for the \"Back\" button.  Even the most seasoned writers like Dr. Merlin have been known to get frustrated when faced with Too Much Information, much to the dismay of their monitors.\n\nExposition is a nemesis for many writers, reminding them to include background information to progress the plot, but it can easily become a hindrance if not done correctly.  This is where the age-old 'show, don't tell' rule comes into play, yet even experienced writers like Dr. Merlin often find themselves slipping into lengthy passages that fail to engage.\n\nIn essence, exposition is about providing the reader with essential details through straightforward narration.  It's similar to a character dumping a wealth of information on another character in a film, as seen in 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner'.  When authors do it in literature, it can be a problem, especially when used to convey the history of a character or event.\n\nA prime example of this can be seen in literature.  You're reading a story and learn about the heroine meeting her beloved at a specific time and place, their wedding being grand, and her husband's tragic demise.  If the author spent two pages detailing this sequence, with the couple only exchanging two lines of dialogue, it would likely be unengaging.  Instead, the author should delve deeper into the husband's character, showcasing his love through his words and actions, allowing the reader to experience his presence in the heroine's life.  This in turn would make the reader more emotionally invested in the story and better understand the heroine's character.\n\nIn short, the reader needs meat to complement the story's bare bones - 'They met, they married, he died.'  As a writer, it's crucial to provide this depth, even when it's tempting to rush through certain aspects of the narrative.  This is especially true when introducing new characters, such as a former Air Force member who's now running a gas station, with a complex past and secretly ambitious dreams.  It's essential to avoid overwhelming the reader with too much information and instead, present it in a way that adds to the story, rather than detracting from it.",
            "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, on August 13, 2011. The first one was a live NBC 4 newscast. The lead story centered around a man in Ashley, Ohio, named Shad Hostettler, who had stabbed his wife multiple times. Although the wife's name was not disclosed, police had already arrested Hostettler. The news team allocated approximately two minutes to this story, which seemed reasonable given the developing nature of the case.\n\nThe subsequent story reported on an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers, who had been critically injured in a shooting in the Sharon Woods area. At the time, no arrests had been made, and the SWAT Team was conducting an investigation. This story appeared to be brief, which may have been due to the fact that the victim was a member of a minority group. It is a common observation that such incidents involving minorities may receive less media attention. \n\nThe following story involved a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, which was likely caused by a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. A $5000 reward was being offered to anyone who could provide information leading to the arrest of the perpetrator.\n\nThe weather forecast for the weekend predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures ranging from the mid to low eighties. Although the segment was a bit short, it was presented as a teaser to encourage viewers to tune in for further updates.\n\nThe newscast also covered a robbery at a UDF in Clime Road, Columbus, where a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie had stolen from the store. He was described as being approximately six feet tall and weighing about 150 pounds. It was notable that the news team devoted a considerable amount of time to emphasizing the perpetrator's ethnicity.\n\nAnother story featured Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas-based drug kingpin. He had been found guilty of smuggling large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. One peculiar aspect of this report was the use of the phrase \"300 months\" instead of \"25 years\" to describe his prison sentence. The inclusion of Rodriguez's Hispanic ethnicity in the story might have been unnecessary.",
            "There's a profound and unbreakable connection between brothers, encompassing a complex array of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. This unique bond allows brothers to understand each other on a deep level, often seeing themselves reflected in their sibling. When faced with challenging situations, the true nature of this bond is revealed, whether it's characterized by positivity or negativity. Along with these emotions comes a sense of responsibility, as one must confront the consequences that arise from them. Gazing into a brother's eyes, one sees not only their own reflection but also their true character, which is revealed through their actions and the outcomes of those actions. This theme is explored in \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" where two brothers navigate the intense feelings associated with their bond amidst a vividly described backdrop. As they embark on a futile journey, bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in a climactic scene, and only one brother manages to survive. The novel conveys this theme through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with his brother, as well as the narrator's perspective, which conveys the complex emotions experienced by the protagonist and his perception of the world around him.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single dominant emotion: pride. From their initial outing together to their final, fateful excursion, he harbors resentment towards Doodle. The protagonist had envisioned a brother who could learn from him and share in his adventures, such as holding his breath, running, or climbing vines in Old Woman Swamp. However, Doodle's physical limitations, resulting from a weak heart, render this ideal impossible. The protagonist's dreams are crushed when he realizes that Doodle will unlikely participate in these activities. In fact, he even experiences anger towards the child, as evidenced by his thoughts of suffocating him with a pillow. However, the child's smile brings about a change in him, revealing an underlying love for his sibling. This shows that his conviction was likely not strong, and his instincts as a brother still prevailed.",
            "The human brain is a complex and imaginative information processing system that has been described using a variety of metaphors as technology progressed. Initially, it was compared to a simple wax tablet, then to a piece of papyrus, followed by a book, and most recently, to a computer. It is essential to keep in mind that these metaphors are limited in their usefulness and may lead to misconceptions. \n\nThe process of processing information in the brain begins with sensory organs converting physical stimuli, such as touch, temperature, sound waves, or light, into electrical signals. These sensory inputs are repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms through bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, the brain initially breaks down the information into basic components like color, orientation, and the borders of the object. This allows it to determine that the image represents a box. However, top-down processing builds upon these initial conclusions to speed up the recognition process by using previously made decisions. This can help identify the object as a specific box, rather than a hole in the background.\n\nOnce information has been processed to a certain point, an attention filter decides its significance and determines which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, even though the brain processes every blade of grass when looking at shoes, a healthy attention filter ensures that we don't notice individual blades. On the other hand, we might focus on our name being spoken in a noisy room. There are multiple stages of processing, and the results are repeatedly modulated by attention.\n\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. The process starts with encoding, where information is converted into a form that can be stored. Various types of encoding exist for different types of sensory inputs. For example, verbal input can be encoded based on how it looks, how it sounds, or what it means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Research on animals suggests that working memory, which stores information for around 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal that temporarily loops through a series of neurons. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained through the structure of specific types of proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models explaining how knowledge is organized in the brain, based on various approaches such as human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, which are linked based on their relatedness. For instance, in this model, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which could be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In his dystopian novel Brave New World, Aldous Huxley critiques the impending dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the capitalistic framework that sustains it. The society in the novel prioritizes communal harmony over individuality, conditioning its citizens from birth to pursue instant gratification above all else. This results in people being reduced to mere pawns in a larger game, confined to a single ideology dictated by the World Controller. Upon analyzing the novel through the lens of Marxist ideology, it becomes evident that Huxley harbors suspicions about the development of these systems. The presence of Marxist terminology such as homogeny and reification underscores the notion that Brave New World is a commentary on the shortcomings of the emerging economic systems of Huxley's time.\n\nHuxley satirizes capitalism by employing the concept of false consciousness, a Marxist thesis which suggests that the common citizenry is kept in the dark about their true relationships with other economic classes, prioritizing personal gain instead. This is achieved through the ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, which is exemplified in the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The lower classes, represented by Delta and Gamma, lack genuine autonomy, with their drive to consume and indulge strengthened through hypnopædia. This manipulation is orchestrated by the World Controller. The novel also illustrates the concept of hegemony, where a dominant group exercises control over others, in this case, the upper classes. The lower classes are oblivious to this manipulation, blindly embracing an ideology that perpetuates the existing structure. In contrast, the upper classes, such as Alphas and Betas, are aware of the manipulation but choose to accept their position, with few exceptions. The interactions between social classes in the novel serve as a testament to the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nThe novel portrays relationships between individuals as superficial, with characters lacking depth and distinction, even among major characters. Huxley may be suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism erodes human free will and self-expression. Love and extreme emotions are nonexistent, replaced by shallow interactions that focus on physical appearances and superficial connections. The societal classes' complacency with their positions in the hierarchy and their absolute obedience to their role in the community reflect the Marxist concept of the proletariat, who are led to believe they are superior as long as they conform and consume.",
            "I have been enrolled in University Park for approximately two and a half years, with four and a half semesters under my belt. For many students, including myself, navigating the campus can be a significant challenge. During my freshman year, I resided in an East Halls dorm, situated on the easternmost part of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. The commute from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in buildings like the Willard building, located near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, particularly on inclement days. I recall speaking with an alumnus, not much older than myself, who shared that the East Halls dorms used to be separated from the rest of the university by large tracts of unused land. However, this vacant space has since been transformed into sports fields, new buildings, such as the Creamery and health services facility, and surrounded by apartments. As the campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another is becoming increasingly difficult. An effective solution to this problem is the bicycle, which is especially beneficial on a college campus. Nevertheless, simply owning a bike is not enough – students need to actually ride them, and the campus infrastructure must be designed with bicyclists in mind.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who has resumed cycling after a hiatus of several years. He expressed his surprise at having stopped riding in the first place, stating, \"Bikes are great; for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the most practical way to get around.\" Bicycling offers numerous physical benefits and is also an efficient means of transportation. With a bowl of oatmeal and some physical exertion, you can cover distances of 30 miles or more. Like many of my peers, I now reside off campus, just as far from the campus center as some dorms. This semester, I made the astute decision to purchase a bike, which has greatly improved my daily routine. With classes in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my home, biking cuts down the time to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly enough. However, the most direct route to Thomas building from my home is Pollock Road, which is not always an easy road to navigate, whether on a bike or on foot. While walking has its advantages, I am too busy to walk. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily routine, resulting in over two and a half hours per week. Considering the cumulative time spent walking to and from classes, appointments, and other commitments, I would be left with little time for anything else."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles.

            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "As I pursue a degree in social work, my goal is to embark on a career path within the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on supporting children who have been abused or neglected, as well as helping troubled families. The values I plan to bring to this field include a commitment to providing service, showing respect, maintaining an ethical approach, and continually enhancing my professional skills to stay up-to-date in my field. These core values not only guide social workers, but they are also deeply personal to me.\n\nI have always been driven to make a positive impact on others, but I initially struggled to identify a specific career path. Through my experiences in high school and college, I witnessed individuals coping with problems in unhealthy ways, which led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break, still uncertain about my career path. One summer, I visited a friend whose sixteen-year-old guest was trying to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that the teenager had contacted the police, and I accompanied them to his parents' residence to offer assistance. The police asked me to speak with the parents, as they were unable to intervene directly. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed evasive and made excuses for their son's behavior. This experience deepened my commitment to a career in social work, specifically to help families resolve conflicts and address the root causes of problems.\n\nAnother essential value for the field of social work is social justice. Our society often emphasizes the importance of individuality and mourns the loss of unique individuals. However, we often prioritize conformity over actual individuality. As someone who values being true to myself, I don't believe in limiting myself to fit in with the majority. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively spoke out against social injustices whenever I could, expressing myself through my appearance, my involvement with the GSBA, and other forms of activism. I firmly believe in the principles of social justice and will continue to advocate for equality and fairness.",
            "This paper delves into the biological and sociocultural models that pertain to insomnia, a disorder that affects an individual's sleep patterns. The biological model emphasizes the genetic and medical factors contributing to insomnia, while the sociocultural model examines the environmental and social influences, such as race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review aims to review and critique the research related to these models, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each study.\n\nInsomnia can be classified as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder associated with another mental health condition, or a sleep disorder resulting from medical complications or substance use. The primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, with Dyssomnias encompassing various conditions such as insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, and circadian rhythm sleep disorder. These disorders involve difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep or staying awake for an extended period. On the other hand, Parasomnias are characterized by abnormal behaviors or physiological occurrences during sleep, such as nightmares, sleep terrors, and sleepwalking.\n\nSleep disorders can also be linked to mental health conditions, specifically those categorized under Axis I (clinical disorders) and Axis II (personality disorders or mental retardation). The focus of this review is on insomnia and primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders explores the genetic and physiological aspects of sleep regulation. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus, particularly those containing orexin, play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study involving mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are responsible for sleep-wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while its inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and improved sleep quality. Furthermore, the study found that a GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep duration in mice. These findings suggest that animal models can be applied to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence of this receptor could lead to sleep disturbances, even without the use of medication. From a sociocultural perspective, this study implies that the inherited phenotype of the receptor could regulate sleep, and any alterations to it could naturally disrupt sleep patterns, affecting various aspects of life, including daily tasks and work performance.",
            "This paper will delve into three key areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with a concise explanation of the disorder, providing an understanding of what CAPD entails. Following this, the diagnostic process for CAPD is explored, highlighting common characteristics or 'red flags' that indicate its presence. Finally, the paper will discuss practical strategies that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom can employ to support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to the brain's efficiency in processing auditory information. It is essentially a neurological condition where the brain struggles to interpret and differentiate sounds, despite the individual having normal hearing. As a result, people with CAPD are not considered hearing-impaired; they can hear sounds clearly, but their brain fails to effectively process and separate them, making it challenging to distinguish between words, conversations, and background noises.\n\nThe concept of CAPD first emerged in the mid-1950s under the name 'auditory imperception' (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), as researchers investigated children with communication disorders. In 1954, the Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing assessment tools for these children, while in 1961, Kimura introduced a novel method called dichotic testing and proposed a model explaining the physiological basis of dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference held in 1977 sparked further research into children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests itself in various ways, including difficulties in localizing sounds in space, distinguishing between multiple sounds, recognizing sound patterns, and detecting changes in speech, such as sarcasm. Additionally, individuals with CAPD may experience sound interference, making it challenging to interpret complex auditory cues and sequence auditory information accurately (Ferre).\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a thorough evaluation is necessary, involving systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests, which may be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals using a range of assessments that evaluate auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). These assessments may include questionnaires, surveys, and observation of auditory behaviors in response to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single, universally accepted diagnostic tool or test for CAPD, and the underlying causes of the disorder remain unknown. Diagnostic tests often involve presenting the individual with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and asking them to differentiate specific items, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the brain's response to these signals.",
            "The play Twelfth Night suggests that disguises can initially be effective in deceiving others, but ultimately, one must abandon the guise to avoid losing their true identity. However, the process of revealing deception can lead to feelings of isolation, making it a difficult decision between self-preservation and preserving relationships with others. While some people may respond calmly to discovering they've been deceived, others may be offended and react negatively.\n\nThe theme of deception through gender role reversal in Twelfth Night raises additional questions, particularly why the character feels the need to hide their true identity and adopt a disguise. Viola, for instance, resorts to disguising herself as a man to protect herself from potential threats while in a foreign land. Although her plan succeeds, it separates her from her female support network and creates complications, including Olivia's confusion of her with her twin brother Sebastian and Orsino's suppressed romantic feelings for her.\n\nTo the modern reader, Twelfth Night can be seen as an example of how deception can facilitate the recognition and exploration of repressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. The play hints that these characters may be driven by unexpressed desires, which are revealed through Viola/Cesario's presence. Olivia's sudden shift in affection from Cesario to Sebastian, as well as her subsequent view of Cesario/Viola as family rather than a romantic partner, may suggest that Olivia is mocking those who judge people based on their appearance, rather than true feelings.",
            "The German colonial regime has been criticized for its harsh treatment, particularly with regards to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge the complexity and diversity of the German colonial administration. The educational systems put in place across the colonies were varied, and even within the same territory, policies and ruling styles differed significantly. When Britain took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a sizable population of well-educated and literate Africans. Similarly, German educational efforts in colonies such as Kamerun were praised by contemporary writers. \n\nHowever, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the government actively supported and established state schools for native education, in South West Africa, the responsibility of educating the indigenous population was largely left to missionary societies that received limited government assistance. \n\nNotably, the government invested considerable resources in the education of European settlers in the colony, establishing a system of state schools and heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. The outcomes of these educational policies persisted in South West Africa long after German rule ended. While many other German colonies showed significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, the vast majority of the population remained illiterate and without access to education. A range of social, political, and economic factors contributed to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper aims to expand the discussion by examining these factors, with a particular focus on new research regarding the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nA substantial body of literature exists on education in the German colonial empire, with the majority of these sources being in German and written during or shortly after the colonial period. The early works primarily focused on describing the educational systems of the colonies, while later studies in English expanded the discourse by conducting comparative analyses of education in various German colonies and more in-depth examinations of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted the significant differences in educational systems across the colonies. A notable work that explicitly addresses the topic of this paper is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa, which compares the educational systems of the two colonies and identifies the factors contributing to their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa is a key factor that explains many of the distinctive aspects of the colony's educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, despite being largely covered in arid desert. This relatively hospitable environment is reflected in the European population, with nearly 15,000 whites residing in South West Africa by 1913, compared to only 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "Over the past 100 years, the classification of popular music has become increasingly complex due to the proliferation of numerous genres. This complexity is further exacerbated by the fact that many prominent genres, such as rock, jazz, country, and folk, have given rise to a multitude of subgenres and sub-subgenres. Among these, heavy metal rock has emerged as one of the most diverse and expressive genres in the past four decades. Characterized by its capacity to convey a wide range of emotions, heavy metal music often leans towards the darker aspects of the emotional spectrum, making it both expressive and diverse.\n\nThe evolution of heavy metal has led to a fragmentation of the genre, with various niches and sub-subgenres emerging over time. As a result, it has become challenging to define the essence of heavy metal music. To understand the contemporary metal music scene, it is essential to grasp the roots and essence of the metal movement.\n\nAt its core, the metal movement is defined by its association with darkness, which is reflected in its emphasis on \"more\" – more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more theatricality. Metal music often features complex, technically proficient musicianship, setting it apart from other genres. Moreover, the metal movement has a strong connection to the use of psychedelic substances, which influenced the creation of some of its most iconic records. The genre's dark, visceral qualities, which were novel in the music scene at the time, have been shaped by various influences, including the Romantic Era's emphasis on the darker aspects of human emotion. The lyrics of classic metal songs, such as \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles, exemplify the genre's affinity for expressing the darker side of human experience.\n\n\"Helter Skelter\" is a notable example of a song that pushed the boundaries of heaviness and darkness in music, with its lyrics and melody reflecting the turbulent, drug-induced state of its creators. This song is often cited as one of the pioneering works of the heavy metal genre, and its release on The White Album was a deliberate attempt by the Beatles to demonstrate their ability to create music that was just as intense as that of the Rolling Stones.",
            "Before the Surrealist artists appeared on the scene, Henri Rousseau was busily creating his own dreamscapes, both literally and figuratively, through his artwork. His 1910 painting, The Dream, is a poignant representation not only of a woman experiencing wonder in a dream world, but also of Rousseau's own aspirations and ambitions as an artist. Since beginning his career, Rousseau had longed for recognition, acclaim, and appreciation from his peers and art enthusiasts. However, this aspiration came with an inner conflict - to conform to established styles to gain acceptance from the art world, or to remain true to his unique vision and artistic voice. The Dream is a powerful reflection of this ongoing internal struggle, one that defined Rousseau's artistic journey.\n\nTo understand The Dream, it's essential to delve into Rousseau's background. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, Rousseau came from a relatively prosperous family. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle. Despite lacking formal artistic training, Rousseau spent decades working for the French municipal toll service, earning a humble living as a gabelou. However, he gained a misleading nickname, douanier, or customs inspector. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children left Rousseau with a single child, Julia, and immense grief. This traumatic event prompted him to seek solace in painting as a means of comfort and new beginnings. Unlike his contemporaries who often romanticized peasants in their art, Rousseau was a folk painter who drew inspiration from the everyday life and aspirations of the common people.\n\nRousseau's desire for recognition in the art world is understandable, given his circumstances. He started his artistic journey late in life, without formal training, and during a time when many talented and well-known artists were already active. His breakthrough came around the same time Matisse began establishing himself as an artist. According to art historian Jan Gordon, while both artists competed in the art world, they differed significantly in style, subject matter, and motivations. Matisse sought to avoid clichés in his work, whereas Rousseau aimed to create conventional art that would earn him acceptance into the prestigious Artiste Français.",
            "There's a long-standing philosophical connection between ethics and aesthetics, and it's rooted in the idea that truth and beauty are inextricably linked. The notion that ethics and beauty are intertwined is not merely a coincidence; it's deeply ingrained in our understanding of the world. As John Keats poignantly expressed in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" beauty is truth, and truth is beauty. This understanding transcends traditional forms of learning, such as education or experience. Instead, it's an inherent aspect of our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics, which are more about describing and interpreting than prescribing specific rules.\n\nWhen it comes to art and morals, our attempts to analyze and critique them often fall short of grasping their essence. For example, discussions about a masterpiece like da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on technical aspects like composition, contrast, and cultural context, but these elements alone cannot fully explain why it's a masterpiece. When people discuss their favorite works of art or literature, they often use phrases like \"there's just something about it,\" implying that there's something intangible and ineffable that cannot be captured by words.\n\nThis is similar to what authors like Flannery O'Connor said about storytelling; it's a way to convey complex ideas that cannot be expressed through straightforward statements. Similarly, ethics has a transcendent quality that cannot be fully described or reduced to a set of qualities. Ludwig Wittgenstein's statement that ethics cannot be expressed and is transcendental resonates with this idea. This intangible aspect of both art and morality is their most powerful attribute, and it's what connects them.\n\nThe connection between ethics and aesthetics is strengthened by the fact that we experience both at a deep, intuitive level, which is often described as noumenal in philosophical terms. This experience is difficult to put into words but is essential to our understanding of both art and morality. Literature, in particular, is distinct from other art forms in its moral qualities, as argued by McKean. While moral standards may not apply to other art forms like music, they are central to literature and its ability to shape our values and understanding of the world. Ultimately, literature is valuable because it reflects and influences our moral compass.",
            "Germany today is a powerful nation with its unique cultural heritage, stretching from the Alps in southern Munich to the Baltic Sea in Kiel, as well as from the Rhine River city of Cologne to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River. This diverse cultural identity is a blend of influences from various sources and tribes. The origins of the term \"Germania\" are shrouded in mystery, with different scholars and historians presenting competing theories. \n\nThe name \"Germania\" is often attributed to the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, according to the Roman historian Tacitus. However, Julius Caesar, who wrote about the Gallic Wars, first used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the Gauls and the Germanic tribes that crossed the Rhine River. Caesar borrowed the term from the Gauls, possibly referring to a neighboring tribe in their language. Another theory suggests that the name \"German\" comes from the word \"ger,\" meaning a type of spear used in warfare, or the Old Irish word \"garim,\" which implies that the Germans were loud or noisy.\n\nTacitus' work, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" written in AD 98, portrays the Germans as an indigenous people who were not significantly influenced by other cultures through migration or intermarriage. He attributes their geographical isolation to the harsh climate, rugged terrain, and unforgiving nature of the region, making it unlikely that people would voluntarily settle there. The Romans, while exploring and conquering Germanic tribes, primarily sent expeditions to trade and acquire resources rather than establishing a permanent presence. As a result, the Germanic tribes interacted with the Roman Empire through trade and military service, shaping their distinct cultural identity.",
            "As I stood there, my mind was blank, taking in the scene before me without processing any emotions. My thoughts flowed in quickly, barely lingering before disappearing again, making it seem like my consciousness was simply observing the scene in front of me without any personal thoughts. This mental state allowed me to experience the world in a fluid way, almost like a detached observer.\n\nThis state of mind was familiar to me, thanks to an artist I worked with who recommended a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had been interested in drawing since I was six, and this book provided a comprehensive guide to learning the art, covering even the basics, such as understanding the properties of a pencil and how our brains interpret lines. The book suggested a technique where you place a frame around the subject you're studying, simplifying a complex image by removing distracting details. \n\nAt that moment, looking at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't mentally impose this frame. I was overwhelmed by the complexity of the scene, so I stood in awe, taking it all in. I thought about the artistic styles of famous artists – Picasso's blue phase, Monet's love of greenery, and the Renaissance masters' use of a wide range of colors. If I wanted to call myself an artist, I felt like I was at the beginning of creating my own work, the start of my story, and I had titled it \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingers landed on my chosen drawing tool, and my hand prepared to create. I focused on the moment, and my hand moved through the air, bringing my creative vision to life. Water swirled and flowed, and a small piece broke away from the whole, disappearing into nothingness. As I tried again, my hand clenched and jerked a bit more forcefully, and I slapped the toilet handle harder, trying to dislodge the uncooperative brown mass stuck at the bottom.\n\nWith the mop in hand, I stood with my feet shoulder-width apart, my green tie awkwardly knotted around my neck, and I frowned at the unpleasant package left for the bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid. After a few more attempts to flush it and a few more moments of introspection, I finally reached for the toilet paper roll on my right, grabbed it, and wrapped my hand in it like a glove. I stood up straight, then bent forward, and slowly submerged my hand into the bowl, mimicking the movement of a mother covering a turkey for Thanksgiving dinner.",
            "The alarming rate of teenage driver fatalities is a concerning issue in the United States.  Several factors contribute to this tragic statistic, including the fact that the adolescent brain is not fully equipped to handle the risks associated with driving.  Additionally, the inexperience of teen drivers is a significant factor in the high number of accidents, rollovers, speeding, and vehicles leaving the road.  Furthermore, when teens drive with their peers, the risk of accidents increases, as highlighted by a study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, which found a correlation between the age of passengers and the number of traffic accidents.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, several states have implemented provisional licenses that restrict the hours teens can drive and prohibit minors from being passengers.  However, I believe that these measures are temporary solutions.  The underlying issue is that, statistically, young drivers are not adequately prepared to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving.  Researcher Marvin Zuckerman suggests that 18 may be too young for a regular driver's license, as individuals under 19-20 tend to seek thrills and take risks.  It would be wise to delay driving until this tendency subsides.  If we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, the number of fatal accidents is likely to rise, and the death toll could reach catastrophic levels.  By 2010, millions of new teen drivers will be on the road, including the children of the Baby Boomers.\n\nImplementing legislation to address this issue would be a straightforward process.  Schools could continue to provide driver's education classes to prepare future drivers, but no one under 18 could operate a vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued before a full license is granted, and practical driving hours would still be required.  The number of required hours could be based on the existing standards of most states, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.  Uniform national legislation would provide a reasonable and effective means of protecting teen drivers across the country.  This proposal is not a new idea, but rather a necessary step to address the alarming statistics surrounding teenage driver fatalities.",
            "While reviewing the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to examine all 15 trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films frequently rely on creative editing techniques to create illusions. My analysis primarily focused on analyzing the aesthetic principles underlying the majority of these trick films and identifying unique characteristics in a select few that deviated from the norm in later years. During this period, trick films were largely static, confined to a single set, and adhered to a strict rule of one shot per film, using a frontal proscenium composition, long shots, and no camera movement. However, some early 20th-century films broke away from these conventions by incorporating elements such as multi-shot scenes.\n\nOne distinctive trait shared by these trick films is the filming of interior scenes within a frontal proscenium framework. The camera remains stationary, never moving to follow characters or objects. This composition was a common feature in early cinema and drew inspiration from the theater and vaudeville/magic performances. A limitation of this approach is that characters typically move horizontally and do not approach or recede from the camera, as seen in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis.\n\nThe use of the frontal proscenium style also led to the prevalence of long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-up shots were never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog, a practice borrowed from the theater and vaudeville, where the audience would view the entire performance within the confines of the stage. As was common in early cinema, actors rarely moved towards the camera, making close-ups virtually non-existent.\n\nMost early trick films followed a pattern where a single conceptual shot equaled a film, limiting their length to around a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This also restricted the narrative or dramatic potential of these films, which mainly featured short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearance, and switching acts with minimal storytelling. However, it's worth noting that in trick films, a single conceptual shot may consist of multiple physical shots combined to create an illusion of disappearance or appearance. A closer inspection of The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film, reveals the moment when the physical shot containing Mary's severed head begins, even though the entire film is perceived as a single shot by the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate for Republicanism, despite primarily being an agriculturalist. His profession and brief career in politics shaped him into a dedicated and outspoken individual who prioritized personal freedom and limited government. His strong connection to an agrarian system underpinned his views on government, as he sought to preserve and promote this perceived superior career path. This emphasis on his primary occupation colored his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judiciary.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to establish an ideal system, unencumbered by native traditions that might hinder its development. He firmly believed in the natural rights of individuals, which he saw as interconnected and essential. These rights should not be subject to government interference, as their denial would undermine the entire system. He argued that the concept of a \"state of nature\" often exploited the strong and cunning, but this was not an acceptable norm in a civilized society.\n\nTo create a perfect society, Taylor argued that the government must account for both the good and evil inherent in human nature. He rigidly adhered to a dualistic morality, asserting that government, being a human institution, would inevitably reflect both its virtues and vices. He believed that good principles, such as protecting private property, promoting agriculture, and discouraging excessive capitalism, would form the foundation of a fair government. This government would function equitably, irrespective of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by self-interest and avarice. However, self-interest was only considered a vice when it led to the exploitation of others. A well-designed government was necessary to manage humanity's natural flaws and prevent the introduction of bad principles.\n\nLike many Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, advocating for a limited federal government with powers explicitly stated in the document. He recognized that a broad federal government would be expensive and potentially tyrannical. However, he also believed that a literal interpretation without consideration for the Founding Fathers' intent could be misleading and prone to corruption. Furthermore, Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defined the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking at Figure 17, we can see a significant drop in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project, which was somewhat concerning. The reasons behind this decline are unclear, but several factors might have contributed. At our New England campus, the onset of winter often results in fewer people commuting by bike or on foot. Additionally, the end of the fall semester in December means students and faculty are preoccupied with finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and other tasks, which may have pushed the commuter log to the backburner. Furthermore, December marks the start of the holiday season, leading to a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many don't need to come to campus. When classes resume in late January, the number of log submissions remained low, suggesting a possible connection. However, the numbers for February were even lower, leaving the reason for this decline unclear. It's possible that initial enthusiasm for the project naturally waned over time, which is a common phenomenon in such initiatives. To counteract this, we organized the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign to revitalize the project, which led to an increase in log submissions. \n\nOne of the challenges we faced with this project is that people generally enjoy the freedom and flexibility of driving their cars, a deeply ingrained aspect of our culture. To encourage alternative commuting methods, we offered prizes in the form of gift cards to local businesses. While this was a successful strategy, it would have been interesting to see the impact of offering larger prizes, such as a new bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have helped sustain the project's momentum, particularly during the dip in engagement we experienced. The value of the prizes remained constant throughout the project, which may have contributed to the decline in participation. If the prizes had been increased over time, with the addition of more substantial rewards in December and January, it's likely that participation and engagement would have increased instead of decreased.",
            "A security known as an exchange-traded fund (ETF) is designed to track an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund, while being more flexible and traded like a stock on an exchange.  ETFs offer the diversification benefits of an index fund and the advantages of owning individual stocks, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as few as one share per transaction.  Although these benefits are highly appealing, ETFs have significantly lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund.  However, there are some drawbacks, including the cost of paying a commission on any ETF trade, similar to paying for a stock order.  Additionally, ETFs offer a wide variety of funds to choose from.  It is essential for the astute financial investor to critically evaluate whether the stated benefits, such as diversification, are indeed present and to what extent they exist.  For the purposes of this analysis, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it to its top 10 holdings to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF are comparable to those of a diversified portfolio of the same 10 stocks, as well as whether there are more optimal configurations of the same stocks that could provide a better risk-return ratio.\n\nTo make the evaluation manageable, we have decided to focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's total assets.  Below are the top 10 holdings and their respective percentages of total assets.\n\nTo gauge how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, to estimate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio consisted entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF's holdings.  The calculations of Beta and Return are presented in the chart below.\n\nFrom the data in the chart, it is clear that a portfolio consisting solely of the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  The results thus far suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could offer higher returns with a lower risk.  Nevertheless, it is possible that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\nTo determine whether these portfolios are statistically different, we have calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% for comparison to the ETF IHF's accumulated standard deviation.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's notable poems is \"Dream-Land,\" in which he prominently features the term \"Thulé.\" Poe's use of this term can be linked to Virgil, who mentioned an island north of Britain as the edge of the known world. However, Poe's inspiration for Thulé may also have been influenced by German literature, which he was known to be interested in. \n\nA notable example of Poe's familiarity with German authors, including Goethe, can be seen in the similarity between their works. Karl J. Arndt notes the resemblance between \"Poe's Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon,\" suggesting that Poe may have been drawing inspiration from Goethe. \n\nAccording to the Oxford Companion to English Literature, Goethe's work \"Faust\" is a celebrated poetic drama that was published in two parts in 1808 and 1832. Within the second part, there is a poem called \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells the story of a king who is consumed by grief after the loss of his wife. This poem bears a striking resemblance to the character in Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" with both featuring a sense of despair and a reliance on drinking to cope with emotional pain.\n\nInterestingly, Goethe's \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term Thulé in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe references Thulé twice in his collected works, using the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and incorporating it as a bookend in \"Dream-Land.\" The parallels between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" suggest that they can be read as companion pieces, with both exploring themes of loss and loneliness. \n\nGiven Poe's admiration for Tennyson and the widespread reproduction of Goethe's work, it is likely that Poe was familiar with Goethe's writing, which suggests that he may have drawn inspiration from \"The King of Thulé\" when creating his own \"Dream-Land.\"",
            "In California, if a customer suffered an injury after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store, they may be eligible for punitive damages if the store manager acted with malicious intent. A court is unlikely to immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To justify an award of punitive damages, a plaintiff must provide evidence that the defendant's actions were taken with a reckless disregard for the potential harm that could result from their behavior, as well as that the conduct itself was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have anticipated the potential harm of not cleaning the spill, given that multiple customers had previously slipped and fallen in the store in the months leading up to her accident. She will also argue that Martin's failure to have the spill cleaned, despite being aware of the potential risks, demonstrates a willful and conscious disregard for customer safety. While Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable is not as strong, it is still a reasonable claim, especially considering that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009 and Martin failed to take adequate measures to ensure store safety. \n\nOn October 13th, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee of D&D Markets, Rich Wayne, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin responded by stating he was on dinner break and unavailable to deal with customer complaints. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin of the spill, and he gave the same response. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, suffering a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, there had been five reported slip-and-fall incidents at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment on the punitive damage claim. \n\nIn California law, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not based on a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" California Civil Code section 3294(a) defines malice as conduct that was intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when it was committed with a deliberate disregard of the plaintiff's rights when the defendant was aware of the potential dangerous consequences of their actions and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences, as seen in the case of Taylor v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County, 598 P.2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "It has been almost four years since I took a course in Islam at CBC, where one of the most debated topics was whether Islam is inherently hostile. In my opinion, this question remains highly relevant today, particularly when considering the shift in mass media's perception of Islam and extremists since 9/11.  What's striking is the transformation from a hostile view to an extreme level of tolerance for Islam in America. This shift is exemplified by the fact that in 2001, it would have been unimaginable to have a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, who has a clear Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad fascinates me. Contrary to my previous understanding of his history, the biography depicts him as a humble martyr rather than a conqueror who forced conversions to Islam. According to my initial knowledge, Muhammad was known to conquer and assimilate tribes, forcing them to adopt Islam. However, the biography portrays him as a leader who was often misunderstood, and his humility eventually won over those who came to understand his message.\n\nI've also noticed eerie similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles attributed to Muhammad. One notable example is when Muhammad miraculously multiplied mutton and milk to feed a large group of people. This narrative style suggests that the authors aimed to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove himself but lived a life of truth and miracles. This approach downplays the significance of Jesus' life and ministry, almost as if they're borrowing and attempting to supplant the essence of Jesus' personhood with Muhammad's story.\n\nThe biography also contains numerous accounts that appear to be intended to provide evidence of the 'witness' or 'conversion' of individuals to Islam. However, many of these stories are presented from a third-party perspective, which undermines their credibility. The stories often originate from hearsay, making it seem suspicious and diminishing their impact.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the attempt to portray Muhammad as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle figure. However, historical records contradict this image of Muhammad, leading me to wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true circumstances surrounding his rise to power.",
            "The core teachings of Jesus and the ideals he promoted during his lifetime were initially overlooked as Christianity evolved beyond his era.  When examining the history of Christianity, we observe a pattern where the faith has gradually strayed further away from its roots.  Today, society is witnessing an increasing awareness and a progressive shift towards a more refined understanding.  While traditionalists continue to hold onto their conventional views and resist any departure from established teachings, their influence may not be substantial enough to dictate the broader direction.  As the years pass, a growing awareness of historical context among Christians will emerge, sparking a desire to distinguish between the original intent of Jesus' teachings and the additional doctrines that were incorporated over time.  This process may take centuries, but it is inevitable that Christianity will eventually undergo a significant reversal, returning to its original form.  As this trend spreads across the United States and Europe, it will inspire a movement to strip away the layers of doctrine, gradually stripping back to the essence of Jesus' message, as it was presented before other thinkers and interpretations took hold.  When this shift affects the masses in these regions, the church as an institution will still maintain its strength, guiding the way forward.  As a result of this reversal, the extreme diversity within Christianity will give way to increased uniformity of belief and practice.  The distinctions between regions, denominations, and other divisions will be replaced by growing similarities.  History is replete with examples of reversals, such as the Roman Empire's shift from persecution to Christian dominance, or the transformation of the United States from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The impending reversal in Christianity will unfold in a similar manner, as the faith seeks to reclaim its roots and, in the process, reduces diversity.  It is essential to note that a key factor in making this reversal possible will be the adoption of a more metaphorical interpretation of Jesus' words, rather than viewing them as literal statements of fact.  To understand the trajectory of Christianity, it is necessary to look back to its origins in Judaism, which was the theological foundation of the Christian faith.  By examining the period before the Roman Empire's control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., we find that Judaism was characterized by a rich diversity of perspectives, with the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and ordinary people each holding distinct views.",
            "The Jungle highlights the inherent self-centered nature of human beings. At their core, people prioritize their own interests over others and seek to improve their lives at the expense of those around them. This is exemplified in the factory owners and managers of Packingtown, who are only driven by the desire to expand their businesses and accumulate wealth, disregarding the impact on the environment and those affected by their operations. Upton Sinclair vividly illustrates this in his description of the factories: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This image serves as a stark representation of the devastating consequences of their actions, such as pollution and environmental degradation. The owners and managers display a callous disregard for the well-being of their employees, using them as mere means to an end. They exploit their workers, pushing them to work excessively long hours and laying them off without warning or support, all in pursuit of profit. During the time period depicted in the novel, there were few laws or regulations protecting workers' safety and well-being, allowing the factory owners and managers to operate with impunity. The workers in Packingtown were expected to endure deplorable working conditions and treatment, with no access to information or assistance. Although some unions formed to represent the workers, they often profited from their struggles, making the situation even more dire. The workers were described as being in a state of servitude, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many authors employ various techniques to evoke specific feelings or attitudes in their readers towards essential subjects. Some of these methods are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes a range of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. He frequently employs an uncommon combination of adjectives and nouns to create a distinct atmosphere surrounding a subject. Alternatively, he assigns meaning to a symbol and later utilizes it to achieve a particular effect. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald develops and utilizes the meaning of several colors, including gold, green, white, and red/pink, to convey specific emotions and ideas.\n\nFitzgerald creates associations for colors such as white/gray and red/pink, and then leverages these meanings to create a particular impression of an object. The meaning he assigns to white/gray is uniformity, with white representing a more refined and upper-class atmosphere, while gray implies something older and faded. To establish this meaning, Fitzgerald consistently uses both colors in the novel's beginning. White is repeatedly associated with characters such as Daisy and Jordan, who are often depicted wearing white. For instance, Nick wears \"white flannels\" to Gatsby's party, and Tom wears a \"white shirt\" when meeting Myrtle. Fitzgerald reinforces this connection by describing mundane, unimportant subjects with these colors, such as the \"white chasms of lower New York\" and the \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable.\n\nFitzgerald further develops this meaning by applying these colors to common or unremarkable people and places. He describes Jordan and Daisy's past as a \"white girlhood,\" and the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes. The dog-seller is portrayed as a \"gray old man.\" After establishing these associations, Fitzgerald uses white/gray to signify a sense of uniformity or lack of importance. This technique is first employed when describing Daisy. After a period of limited use of these colors, Fitzgerald reintroduces Daisy dressed in white, which contributes to her characterization as a uniform, interchangeable entity, something Gatsby desires but also longs for. He repeats this technique to reinforce this impression, using images such as a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and her appearance in a \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County boasts significant agricultural output, primarily due to its favorable climate characterized by mild temperatures and ample sunlight. The region's agricultural sector includes a wide variety of crops such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial demand for locally sourced, organic produce in the area, with many community-supported agriculture initiatives having lengthy waiting lists for their products. Organic dairy and poultry products are also in high demand. Many local farms provide opportunities for visitors to explore their operations, as well as engage in recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching. By adopting organic farming practices, landowners can take advantage of government incentives while enhancing biodiversity, creating opportunities for ecotourism, and generating revenue through educational programs.\n\nIn addition to catering to a potentially lucrative market niche, organic farming often leads to increased biodiversity in the area due to the absence of chemical usage. However, organic farming can be more labor-intensive and costly than conventional methods, particularly when it comes to pest control and soil fertilization. Additionally, small organic farms often lack the efficiency and economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations. Other conservation practices, unrelated to organic farming, can also incur higher labor costs, including the use of cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to create specific habitats.\n\nA hypothetical landowner in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expert guidance to optimize both profit and habitat quality. \n\nThe hypothetical land in question is located adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California, and spans 160 acres of chaparral, non-native grasslands, and oak woodlands, situated next to the Cleveland National Forest. This area falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered or threatened with listing, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nHistorically, this region was inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 19th century. The land in question was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and/or wood production over the intervening decades.\n\nTo provide a realistic example of a farming operation in this area, I selected a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to determine the options available to small-scale farmers for reducing costs and preserving wildlife-friendly practices. I also identified an organic farm in the same region as a model for what a landowner might aim to achieve.",
            "In negotiations, understanding and accounting for cultural differences is crucial. Culture encompasses a wide range of nuances that cannot be defined by a single characteristic or trait. Stereotypes, such as \"Russians are stubborn\" or \"Japanese are accommodating,\" oversimplify the complexities of a culture and are often inaccurate. A more effective approach is to comprehend the specific cultural values and attitudes relevant to the negotiation at hand, as they can significantly impact the dynamic at the bargaining table. When interacting with a foreign culture, one tends to draw comparisons to their own, which can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nTo navigate cultural differences, it is essential to delve into the culture, its history, and values, rather than judging or trying to alter them. Acceptance and understanding of the culture, particularly when dealing with a weaker bargaining position, can facilitate a smoother negotiation. When on unfamiliar territory, respecting local customs and traditions can help break down cultural barriers and facilitate progress.\n\nIt is essential to recognize that culture extends beyond national or international boundaries. Companies within a nation develop their unique corporate cultures, shaped by factors such as work hours, communication styles, hiring practices, and dress codes. These differences can be observed within a single nation, as seen in the varying corporate cultures across the United States. The apparent uniformity of certain cultures can be misleading, and it is crucial to look beyond the surface to uncover the complexities.\n\nUnderstanding a culture's values is particularly vital, as they provide insight into the underlying motivations and priorities. For instance, in cultures where saving face or communal harmony is valued, a negotiator will avoid publicly embarrassing their company or superior. On the other hand, in cultures that prioritize a hard-driven bargain, negotiators may be more likely to push for a favorable deal. Considering these cultural factors beforehand can significantly enhance the effectiveness of a negotiation. Nevertheless, gaining a deeper understanding of one's counterpart on a personal level can also be invaluable in achieving a successful negotiation.",
            "The famous phrase \"The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" originates in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is at the forefront of St. Anselm's argument for God's existence. This notion is also shared by Thomas Aquinas. Since both authors defend the same concept, it's essential to assume they are correct in their belief in the God of the Bible for the sake of comparison. If we were to consider a deity that differs from the one in whom our authors believe, we wouldn't be able to properly compare their arguments, as they are fundamentally centered around a specific idea of God. \n\nWhile each author presents valid points, neither provides a comprehensive foundation for believing in God. To demonstrate this, let's first examine St. Anselm's argument. Anselm's reasoning relies on gaining understanding through faith, exploring one's own consciousness to find proof of God. He suggests that God's existence is inherent within our understanding, making it impossible to conceive of his nonexistence. Although the specifics of Anselm's argument can be wordy and confusing, the core idea is that the proof for God lies within our minds and doesn't necessitate any external evidence. This concept of accepting something without definitive empirical proof is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas proposes that God's existence can be proven solely through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith altogether. This approach would be advantageous in evangelism, a crucial aspect of Christianity, as it would enable the recruitment of new followers without relying on their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. Instead, Aquinas employs logical arguments based on change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony to demonstrate the logical necessity of God's existence. He illustrates that understanding the characteristics of a missing puzzle piece is possible through the assembly of the rest of the puzzle, even if the piece itself is not visible.",
            "It is believed that around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince destined to be known as the Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he renounced worldly life and achieved enlightenment, which led to the establishment of Buddhism, specifically the Theravada tradition. Although the religion is now over 2,500 years old, it has undergone significant changes, as seen in countries like Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. This event, attended by both monks and laypeople, holds spiritual significance, despite the Buddha never mentioning a similar celebration. These changes can be observed in both the surface-level customs and the core teachings of Buddhism. The Theravada Buddhist community has adapted its core principles over time, influenced by both internal and external forces, which may be either hostile or benevolent.\n\nTo facilitate this discussion, it is essential to understand the concepts of internal and external forces. An internal force refers to influences stemming from within the Buddhist community, regardless of the individual's monastic status, whereas an external force originates from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any influence that damages or seeks to damage the Buddhist community, often driven by a negative perception of Buddhism. In contrast, a benign force does not intend to harm or help the community but may inadvertently cause either outcome. These terms will be used throughout this analysis.\n\nTo begin, it is crucial to explore the fundamental principles of Theravada Buddhism. Adherents seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, encompassing the Tripitaka, consists of three baskets of Buddhist scriptures: the Sutta Pitaka, containing the teachings; the Vinaya Pitaka, outlining disciplinary rules; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, delving into metaphysical concepts. These concepts include the notions of Anatta (no permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these principles is essential to escaping Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, and ultimately overcoming the afflictions of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), which are characteristic of a state of enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth guidelines for Buddhist adherents, with laypeople adhering to five precepts and monks following a more extensive set of disciplinary rules. The four noble truths are the fundamental teachings of Buddhism: the acknowledgment of Dukkha (suffering is inherent in life), the causal relationship between attachment and suffering, and the possibility of overcoming suffering.",
            "The United States and Mexico provide a notable example of two nations that were embroiled in a prolonged rivalry spanning 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. This rivalry peaked during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, in which the United States defeated Mexico and secured control over Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Over the course of their relationship, the two nations experienced numerous conflicts, which gradually subsided before the onset of World War I. The initial tensions arose from fundamental differences in their values, cultural practices, and traditions, as well as conflicting material interests. \n\nSimilarities can be drawn with other countries that share a border, as these nations often experience clashes of interests, leading to the development of rival positions. The United States and Mexico's relationship is not unique in this regard, with David M. Pletcher commenting that \"only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-standing American diplomatic challenges\" (Pletcher, 1977, p. 41). Their geographical proximity to the United States, in addition to historical rivalries, contributed to their tumultuous relationship. In contrast, many other Latin American nations have maintained positive relations with the United States.\n\nThe discord between the two nations was also fueled by differences in their religious beliefs, which have been a source of conflict in many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm noted that Americans' opposition to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries was a significant factor in their relationship with Mexico (Frahm, 2001, p. 86). This ideological divide mirrored the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, which was characterized by a mix of ideological and interest-driven competition. However, the United States and Mexico's rivalry was rooted in their differing religious preferences, rather than their political systems. The animosity between the two nations was, in part, inherited from the distrust between their former colonial rulers, the English and Spanish, which hindered the establishment of amicable diplomatic relations.\n\nAccording to Diehl and Goerts (2000), 17 disputes arose between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry period. Most of these disputes involved territorial issues, such as Mexican raids into U.S. territory and border problems. The presence of bandits and outlaws from American border towns posed a significant challenge, which was eventually addressed through joint military action by both nations (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97). \n\nSchmitt (1974) explained that the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became increasingly reliant on the United States and, eventually, as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico, marking the end of the rivalry in the late 19th century.",
            "It has been fifteen years since I was unexpectedly disabled by an illness that I was unaware of. At the time, I was a nurse, a profession I chose to pursue in response to the uncertainty and insecurity I experienced during my childhood. The notion that one could always find work because people would inevitably fall ill was a mantra that resonated with me. Although my true aspirations lay in becoming a scientist or journalist, I opted for nursing as a more stable career path.\n\nHowever, I found myself at a crossroads at the age of 46, with no savings and no ability to work. Fifteen years of living on Social Security Disability have left me with nothing to call my own. Each day is a struggle, and I face challenges to my sense of security, safety, and self-esteem. One thing that I am certain of is that without the support of my family and a few close friends, I would not have been able to survive these years, regardless of my strength. In reality, when adversity strikes, one's sense of strength is often greatly diminished.\n\nMy point is that life is inherently unpredictable, and emergencies – big or small – will inevitably arise. No amount of preparation can guarantee a smooth ride, and some challenges are too overwhelming to face alone.\n\nWhile I agree that Americans should not rely too heavily on big government, I believe that fostering a culture of mutual trust and assistance would be a more desirable approach. Rather than relying solely on individual efforts to prepare for disasters, I advocate for Americans to learn from one another, to offer help when needed, and to ask for help without hesitation. This approach is reminiscent of the values that truly sustained our ancestors during difficult times – compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources.\n\nThe idea of rugged individualism, touted by some Conservatives as a driving force behind the country's success, is a myth. In reality, it was our forefathers' ability to come together, show compassion, and share resources that helped them overcome hardships. The pioneers who traversed the Rockies in wagon trains did not achieve their goal in isolation; it was through collective effort and support.\n\nI, too, believe in being prepared for emergencies. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, and other essential items to ensure my safety in case of a crisis. If possible, having a small farm with a wood stove and the ability to preserve food can be a great asset. However, this is not a substitute for building a support network of neighbors who can offer aid when needed. Therefore, it is essential to get to know those around you and build relationships that can provide a sense of security and community in times of need.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in a particular manner remains a topic of interest, and it is unclear if there are any restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change.  Even in the early 20th century, D'Arcy Thompson noted that biologists were still struggling to mathematically describe even the simplest organic forms.  However, more recently, researchers have applied mathematical modeling to the development and evolution of mollusk skeletons, covering both their development from birth (ontogeny) and their evolutionary history (phylogeny). Our study aims to investigate how combining mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum with experimental studies can help reveal the underlying mechanisms driving the direction and magnitude of evolutionary developmental changes. By analyzing X-radiographic images of Prunum species, we identified quantitative parameters that can be used to model both hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were fed into the software program CerioShell to simulate various shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. We are integrating these findings with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a better understanding of major evolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a tube that travels through space over time, making 360-degree turns as it grows. These turns, known as whorls, are thought to spiral around an imaginary central axis called the columella, which runs through the shell's central column. The rate at which the whorls expand can vary, and a continuous line separating each whorl is referred to as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl (the body whorl) is the last one formed. The spire consists of all the whorls except the last one. The apex is the tip of the spire, while the opposite end is the base. The animal exits its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various angles, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The typical orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count the whorls, the shell should first be viewed from the apical perspective, and then the first suture should be identified. A line can be drawn to divide the shell into two parts, and whorls are counted from this line, estimating them to a quarter of a whorl if necessary.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of openings that move through time and space as the animal grows and builds its shell. It is possible to track the path of the aperture by measuring the coordinates of the center of each whorl's opening, as well as its horizontal and vertical radius. This trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. By developing a mathematical formulation, it becomes possible to modify parameters and alter the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Despite a decade of relative stagnation in neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia, the country still has a long way to go to meet its Millennium Development Goals, particularly in child and maternal health.  Although progress has been made in several areas, such as water and sanitation, the country's health system struggles to make significant improvements in these areas.  This points to a need to strengthen the overall health system rather than focusing solely on targeted programs.\n\nIndonesia has made some progress in increasing the number of skilled healthcare workers attending births, with 72% of births now meeting this standard.  However, this statistic includes traditional birth attendants who may not have the necessary medical training to handle complications, contributing to a high number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage.  Thus, these improvements may be misleading, and more work is needed.  Additionally, the percentage of children under five treated by a healthcare professional for diarrheal illnesses has decreased, and data on postnatal care is incomplete, revealing concerns in these areas. \n\nThe low cesarean-section rate of 4% indicates a lack of access to specialized medical care, with a significant disparity between urban and rural areas.  In urban settings, the c-section rate is 7%, while it is only 2% in rural areas, highlighting the disparity in access to healthcare services.  Furthermore, a 27% gap in service utilization exists between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the poor face significant barriers in accessing healthcare due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering ways to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the key question is how to effectively address the shortage of healthcare services.  The main issue is whether Indonesia should focus on developing targeted programs or strengthening its overall health system, rather than solely addressing pre and post-pregnancy care.  While program-specific approaches may yield faster results and have more manageable objectives, they also have drawbacks.  Investing heavily in one area of the health sector can divert resources and personnel away from other areas, leading to duplication of services and inefficiencies.  This can result in unnecessary administrative burdens and waste of resources.",
            "Victorian novels are characterized by their meticulous attention to detail and focus on the aristocracy of the time period. However, novels such as Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights diverge from this tradition. These two works incorporate an element of mystery and a distinct flair for the unusual, characteristics not typically found in novels of the era. This emphasis on the unknown strengthens the characters within the narrative, offering a deeper understanding of their motivations and emotions.\n\nIn the midst of turmoil, a character's mind becomes flooded with a multitude of confusing ideas and images. As seen in the passage from Dickens, a character's perception of reality becomes distorted, with fragmented scenes unfolding before their eyes. This disorienting experience is characterized by the blending of reality and fantasy, leaving the character with an intense sense of unease and discomfort.\n\nIn Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, the authors frequently employ dream sequences or dream-like states to convey the inner workings of the characters' minds. These surreal episodes often reveal the characters' deepest fears, insecurities, and desires. For instance, Oliver Twist's hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit serve as a manifestation of his inner turmoil and desperation. When Oliver relives the shooting scene in chapter 28, he is overwhelmed by a sense of helplessness and despair, highlighting his lack of control over the events unfolding around him. This portrayal underscores the theme of Oliver's powerlessness, as he is unable to influence the outcome of events, even when his life is at stake.\n\nFurthermore, the recurring theme of defeat and hopelessness is a significant aspect of Oliver's character development. His inability to take control of his circumstances, despite being faced with dire consequences, suggests that he has become resigned to his fate, allowing Fagin's influence to shape his actions and reactions.\n\nIn the same vein, the passage from Dickens continues to convey the theme of despair and hopelessness. The protagonist's perception of time becomes distorted, with days passing by in an instant, while the nights seem interminably long and filled with a sense of foreboding. The contrast between the fleeting nature of time and the eternal duration of the protagonist's suffering serves to heighten the sense of hopelessness and desperation.",
            "About two years ago, I was working in an after-school program where I tutored elementary school students in various subjects. I focused on helping them with their struggles in English and reading, as these were my areas of expertise. However, I was approached by one of the instructors to work with a third or fourth-grader named Adrian, who was facing significant difficulties with reading. As I worked with him, I realized that something was amiss; he had a peculiar reading problem, where he could effortlessly pronounce some letters, but struggled with others. This was quite unusual, especially considering that Adrian's mother spoke only Spanish, yet he spoke flawless English. It wasn't until I met his mother that the issue became clear: Adrian could read, but he had a weak understanding of the English alphabet. Although I'm not sure if this realization significantly impacted his reading abilities, I hope he has made progress since then.\n\nI share this anecdote to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, particularly in California. My story also serves to illustrate that this problem may not always be as apparent as we assume, even for students who speak perfect English, reading can still be a significant challenge. The situation with Adrian's mother made me realize that the solution to this issue is not as straightforward as it seems. While a simple approach like tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation, might work for some, it is not a universal solution for students whose first language is not English.\n\nIn my opinion, the key to addressing this complex issue lies in combining multiple strategies. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes, among others, are not mutually exclusive and can be used in conjunction with one another. In fact, combining these approaches can lead to better outcomes.\n\nThe dual language system, for instance, has been shown to be highly effective, not only for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Research indicates that students in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Despite the common misconception that this approach is a waste of resources, studies have shown that it benefits the majority of students, not just a select few. If we were to adopt this approach as a standard rather than an exception, all students would reap the benefits. However, implementing this system would require some adjustments, such as providing bilingual support staff, rather than expecting all teachers to be fluent in multiple languages. This would not only be impractical but also unrealistic. Nevertheless, I believe that having bilingual support staff or tutors can make a significant difference in helping students overcome language barriers.",
            "As children, many of us are taught that there exists something beyond our comprehension, something greater than ourselves.  This concept can be learned in various settings, such as Sunday school or through personal reflection.  While some people adhere to the faith passed down to them by their families, others refuse to accept any notion of a higher power, instead embracing a self-centered worldview.  It is common for individuals to adopt one set of values, only to later change and adopt another.  Our pursuit of spirituality serves as a means to understand ourselves and our place in the world.  We seek guidance, a beacon of hope, to lead us out of darkness and into the light.\n\nIn a moment of quiet contemplation on our front porch, my father shared with me his favorite type of bird, the cardinal, while the sound of rain pounded against the tin roof above us.  His frail appearance, brought on by recent health struggles, was a stark contrast to his former robust self.  As he gazed out into the rain, I felt a deep sense of unease and a longing to talk to him about my impending loss, but I knew that acknowledging it would only make the reality more painful for both of us.  I found solace in our shared silence, and I drew closer to him, sitting beside him as we both looked out into the rain.\n\nMy father's passing occurred five days after my twenty-second birthday in December.  Despite the medical treatments that prolonged his life beyond the expected period, his suffering persisted.  I found myself questioning a higher power, wondering if it existed at all and, if so, whether it had abandoned me.  In the stillness of night, I chose not to pray, as I felt that any divine being had long since stopped listening to my pleas.\n\nI had not wanted to witness his transition from life to death, so I chose not to be there.  I couldn't bear to see the person who had given me life slipping away.  Instead, I chose to remember him through his life, not his passing.  I knew him better than anyone, and I believed that he would not have wanted me to be present at his death.  I spent three days in solitude, waiting for news of his passing.  Unfortunately, I was not even contacted during that time.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is itself an oxymoron, as described by Ian Watt in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, combining the concepts of \"old\" and \"new.\" The Gothic genre has been subject to diverse opinions, ranging from criticism for lacking depth to praise for evoking a sense of the \"terrible sublime.\" The pioneering work, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, drew upon both ancient and modern romance elements to establish the proto-Gothic genre and create a new style of literary expression. By blending old theatrical elements with the modern novel's format, Walpole presented \"A Gothic Story\" that appealed to a unique blend of past and present.\n\nThe Gothic genre heavily draws from medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions, which were already perceived as archaic and unsophisticated in comparison to modern societal and literary advancements at the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication. However, it was the combination of the dramatic, theatrical aspects of the Gothic with the novel's ability to offer a personal insight into character psychology that allowed the genre to endure and become both timeless and innovative to readers separated from the original writing by time.\n\nOne of the key features of Gothic literature is the romanticization of the concept of Chivalry. In The Castle of Otranto, the medieval idea of chivalry, which involves the training of a noble knight, is both preserved and transformed. This theme holds significant importance in Gothic literature because it represents the idealized image of a brave, honorable, and capable knight, and the perceived lack of such qualities in the authors' contemporary society. By employing chivalric concepts and ideals, the Gothic past is idealized and romanticized, foreshadowing the evolution of Gothic into Romantic literature. \n\nThe author, Horace Walpole, wrote The Castle of Otranto during a time of social turmoil, and his writing reflects his concerns about the apparent decline of moral values and innate goodness in society. This is evident in the character of Frederic, a prince who embodies many chivalric traits. The description of Frederic as a prince who has suffered, been affected by tragedy, and is said to have been killed by infidels, exemplifies the exaggerated image of the gallant and courteous knight that is characteristic of the Gothic genre.",
            "Supply chain management is the intricate network of processes involved in moving goods from the initial customer order to the final delivery of products to customers. The concept of supply chain management was first introduced by Keith Oliver in 1982, a renowned consultant who outlined the essential components of effective supply chain management, encompassing planning, implementation, and control to meet customer needs efficiently. The core elements of a supply chain include production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information, which business managers utilize to deliver exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction is the foundation of the supply chain process, requiring careful planning of 'when', 'why', 'where', and 'how' products will be manufactured. To achieve this, managers need to understand customer requirements, which can be determined by analyzing market trends. This analysis enables managers to decide on the products to be produced, their quantities, production locations, and optimal production volume to meet customer demands. Scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment are critical tasks to be addressed during this stage, as every detail plays a vital role in the overall efficiency of the process. A well-planned production process, like the ones adopted by companies such as Wal-Mart and Target, ensures a smooth operation, minimizing confusion and miscommunication.\n\nSupply is another crucial element in supply chain management, involving strategic decisions that define a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. This may involve allocating different production divisions to specific tasks, leveraging their unique equipment, workers, and specialties. Alternatively, management may opt to outsource certain processes to other companies to achieve velocity, which means providing quality products while maintaining low costs by enhancing flexibility and efficiency.",
            "The sign on the street corner, held up by Ellen Page, reads, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" The juxtaposition of this message with the image of the actress, who starred in the film Juno, is striking. Burma, now known as Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia that has been ruled by a repressive military regime since a coup in 1962. In 2007, a wave of protests swept the country, known as the \"Saffron Revolution,\" which was led by Buddhist monks who wore saffron-colored robes. The protests, which began peacefully, soon turned violent as the government cracked down on the monks and their supporters. Journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai, were arrested and killed while covering the protests. Estimates of the death toll vary, but one colonel who defected from the military claimed that the true number of deaths was in the thousands. \n\nThis is not an isolated incident. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain control over their citizens. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine authority, while Japanese emperors were believed to be gods. Even in modern times, leaders have used various means to silence opposition, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, and the atrocities committed during Hitler's \"Third Reich.\" These examples highlight the enduring pattern of governments using force to maintain power and silence dissent.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on jazz is largely due to his remarkable career longevity and his ability to showcase his orchestra's individual talents through his creative genius. Although his piano presence is often understated in many compositions, Ellington excelled as a composer, crafting intricate and complex pieces that highlighted the unique abilities of each band member. As a master composer, he skillfully created frameworks that allowed soloists to improvise freely while writing tightly orchestrated pieces that emphasized the distinctive styles of individual members. This approach not only showcased the orchestra's cohesive sound but also enabled Ellington to produce some of the most groundbreaking pieces in the history of jazz.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative use of voice as a musical instrument throughout his career, exemplified by Creole Love Call, an early piece that incorporated vocals to add texture and depth without lyrics. This 12-bar blues piece demonstrates Ellington's ability to complement the styles of his soloists, a trait evident throughout his work. The composition features six distinct choruses, each showcasing a unique aspect of the band's sound:\n\nThe first chorus features a call-and-response dialogue between voice and reeds, with the voice transitioning from smooth to rough. The second chorus features a muted trumpet solo elaborating on the melody and emphasizing extended blue notes. The third chorus features a sweeping clarinet solo in a high register accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase. The fourth chorus is a full-band rendition of the first chorus, with a call-and-response between brass and reed sections. The fifth chorus is the climactic point of the piece, with reeds taking the lead and syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections. The final chorus returns to the first chorus's structure, with the voice adopting a growl technique and soloing as an instrument. The piece concludes with a brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice as a tone-color instrument is a recurring theme throughout his work, as seen in pieces like Creole Love Call. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his orchestration skills with his sensitivity to tone color, using a call-and-response phrase between Bubber Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing to create a rich and complementary sound. In It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington leverages Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's talents as a trombonist to great effect, introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "She had long harbored an unfulfilled longing, a sense of emptiness that persisted since her early teenage years. By the time she turned 17, she had become convinced that the solution lay in finding a romantic partner, yet she found herself uninterested in the boys who had shown interest in her. Her introspection had led to various theories, but none had seemed satisfactory. Her life was a continuous cycle of questioning her desires.\n\nOrdinarily, her home was a peaceful haven, with her parents maintaining a calm atmosphere, and disagreements with her being a rare occurrence. Her parents valued her independence and lively personality, which complemented their own tranquil nature. However, today was an exception. As she searched for inspiration, she was startled by her mother's anguished cry from the kitchen. She rushed in to find her mother lying on the ground, in obvious pain, and repeatedly saying \"Ow.\" With growing panic, her daughter rushed to her side and offered assistance. \"Ouch... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother gasped. The daughter quickly assessed the situation and helped her mother get into the car.\n\nUpon arriving at the hospital, the daughter was surrounded by the harsh smells of disinfectant and illness mixed with an air of concern. But her focus remained on her mother's well-being. She quickly helped her mother onto a rolling bed and called for medical assistance. The doctors and nurses rushed to her side, and her daughter was left to anxiously wait. \n\nIt turned out that her mother had slipped off a step stool while trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to identify a connection between adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, reflected by a high alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score, and a reduced risk of heart disease and stroke, as well as stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet, an adaptation of the traditional Mediterranean diet, emphasizes the consumption of plant-based foods, including fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, and plant-based proteins (excluding potatoes), along with higher intakes of monounsaturated fats and fish, while limiting animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is also permitted.\n\nPrevious studies had found an inverse link between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and total and cardiovascular mortality. Furthermore, a clinical trial demonstrated that the Mediterranean diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving the cholesterol ratio in obese individuals. However, prior research did not specifically examine the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis observational study tracked 74,886 middle-aged women without a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, who were participants in a larger cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. An aMed diet score was computed from self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) six times between 1984 and 2004, assessing nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of nurses maintained their participation throughout the 20-year study period. The accuracy of FFQs was validated, and reports of heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke were confirmed through medical records, hospital records, or death certificates. Cases where records were unavailable were classified as \"probable\" and included in the analysis, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal heart attacks falling into this category. Additional factors, including body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone replacement therapy, were also calculated for each FFQ. Starting in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo account for individual variations and better represent long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two prior years). Potential confounding factors were adjusted for, including age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe study employed Cox proportional-hazard modeling to investigate the association between the aMed score and the risk of heart disease and stroke, using separate models for fatal and non-fatal heart disease and stroke types.\n\nThe findings showed that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal heart disease and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk of both heart disease and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk, 0.71).",
            "The United States faced a severe financial crisis in 2007, marked by soaring unemployment, a collapsed housing market, and numerous prominent corporations on the brink of collapse. This ongoing economic downturn has prompted the question: what led to this crisis, and how can we prevent it? In essence, the financial crisis was triggered by shortsighted and reckless policy decisions that forced banks and companies to issue high-risk sub-prime loans to an underdeveloped financial system. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, tasked with underwriting and repackaging these mortgages into complex financial instruments, further exacerbated the problem. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks struggled to maintain their capital reserves, leading to a chain reaction that spread financial chaos throughout the economy.\n\nThe roots of the crisis date back to 1999, when the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions in a bid to boost the President's popularity. This decision laid the groundwork for the sub-prime crisis that unfolded seven years later. In 1999, New York Times journalist Steven Holmes sounded a warning about the potential consequences of this policy: Fannie Mae, the largest mortgage underwriter in the country, faced pressure from the government to expand its lending to low- and moderate-income households, and from shareholders to maintain its profit margins. Holmes foresaw the possibility of a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\n\nA combination of factors contributed to the economic turmoil, including the proliferation of complex mortgage products such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These instruments deeply entangled various sectors of the economy with the housing market, leaving households and financial institutions heavily exposed to even minor fluctuations in housing prices. As a result, the housing market bubble burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities reeling. In 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, equivalent to approximately 30% of the country's GDP. The crisis ultimately led to the sale of Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch at fire-sale prices, the dismantling of Lehman Brothers, and the forced transformation of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley into commercial banks subject to strict regulation. Fannie and Freddie, burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "The infamous exposition - a part of storytelling where writers often struggle to strike the right balance between drawing readers in and overwhelming them with unnecessary details.  It's the moment when you spread your creative wings, only to risk sending your audience to sleep or reaching for the \"Back\" button.  Even the most seasoned writers like Dr. Merlin have been known to get frustrated when faced with Too Much Information, much to the dismay of their monitors.\n\nExposition is a nemesis for many writers, reminding them to include background information to progress the plot, but it can easily become a hindrance if not done correctly.  This is where the age-old 'show, don't tell' rule comes into play, yet even experienced writers like Dr. Merlin often find themselves slipping into lengthy passages that fail to engage.\n\nIn essence, exposition is about providing the reader with essential details through straightforward narration.  It's similar to a character dumping a wealth of information on another character in a film, as seen in 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner'.  When authors do it in literature, it can be a problem, especially when used to convey the history of a character or event.\n\nA prime example of this can be seen in literature.  You're reading a story and learn about the heroine meeting her beloved at a specific time and place, their wedding being grand, and her husband's tragic demise.  If the author spent two pages detailing this sequence, with the couple only exchanging two lines of dialogue, it would likely be unengaging.  Instead, the author should delve deeper into the husband's character, showcasing his love through his words and actions, allowing the reader to experience his presence in the heroine's life.  This in turn would make the reader more emotionally invested in the story and better understand the heroine's character.\n\nIn short, the reader needs meat to complement the story's bare bones - 'They met, they married, he died.'  As a writer, it's crucial to provide this depth, even when it's tempting to rush through certain aspects of the narrative.  This is especially true when introducing new characters, such as a former Air Force member who's now running a gas station, with a complex past and secretly ambitious dreams.  It's essential to avoid overwhelming the reader with too much information and instead, present it in a way that adds to the story, rather than detracting from it.",
            "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, on August 13, 2011. The first one was a live NBC 4 newscast. The lead story centered around a man in Ashley, Ohio, named Shad Hostettler, who had stabbed his wife multiple times. Although the wife's name was not disclosed, police had already arrested Hostettler. The news team allocated approximately two minutes to this story, which seemed reasonable given the developing nature of the case.\n\nThe subsequent story reported on an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers, who had been critically injured in a shooting in the Sharon Woods area. At the time, no arrests had been made, and the SWAT Team was conducting an investigation. This story appeared to be brief, which may have been due to the fact that the victim was a member of a minority group. It is a common observation that such incidents involving minorities may receive less media attention. \n\nThe following story involved a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, which was likely caused by a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. A $5000 reward was being offered to anyone who could provide information leading to the arrest of the perpetrator.\n\nThe weather forecast for the weekend predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures ranging from the mid to low eighties. Although the segment was a bit short, it was presented as a teaser to encourage viewers to tune in for further updates.\n\nThe newscast also covered a robbery at a UDF in Clime Road, Columbus, where a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie had stolen from the store. He was described as being approximately six feet tall and weighing about 150 pounds. It was notable that the news team devoted a considerable amount of time to emphasizing the perpetrator's ethnicity.\n\nAnother story featured Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas-based drug kingpin. He had been found guilty of smuggling large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. One peculiar aspect of this report was the use of the phrase \"300 months\" instead of \"25 years\" to describe his prison sentence. The inclusion of Rodriguez's Hispanic ethnicity in the story might have been unnecessary.",
            "There's a profound and unbreakable connection between brothers, encompassing a complex array of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. This unique bond allows brothers to understand each other on a deep level, often seeing themselves reflected in their sibling. When faced with challenging situations, the true nature of this bond is revealed, whether it's characterized by positivity or negativity. Along with these emotions comes a sense of responsibility, as one must confront the consequences that arise from them. Gazing into a brother's eyes, one sees not only their own reflection but also their true character, which is revealed through their actions and the outcomes of those actions. This theme is explored in \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" where two brothers navigate the intense feelings associated with their bond amidst a vividly described backdrop. As they embark on a futile journey, bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in a climactic scene, and only one brother manages to survive. The novel conveys this theme through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with his brother, as well as the narrator's perspective, which conveys the complex emotions experienced by the protagonist and his perception of the world around him.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single dominant emotion: pride. From their initial outing together to their final, fateful excursion, he harbors resentment towards Doodle. The protagonist had envisioned a brother who could learn from him and share in his adventures, such as holding his breath, running, or climbing vines in Old Woman Swamp. However, Doodle's physical limitations, resulting from a weak heart, render this ideal impossible. The protagonist's dreams are crushed when he realizes that Doodle will unlikely participate in these activities. In fact, he even experiences anger towards the child, as evidenced by his thoughts of suffocating him with a pillow. However, the child's smile brings about a change in him, revealing an underlying love for his sibling. This shows that his conviction was likely not strong, and his instincts as a brother still prevailed.",
            "The human brain is a complex and imaginative information processing system that has been described using a variety of metaphors as technology progressed. Initially, it was compared to a simple wax tablet, then to a piece of papyrus, followed by a book, and most recently, to a computer. It is essential to keep in mind that these metaphors are limited in their usefulness and may lead to misconceptions. \n\nThe process of processing information in the brain begins with sensory organs converting physical stimuli, such as touch, temperature, sound waves, or light, into electrical signals. These sensory inputs are repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms through bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, the brain initially breaks down the information into basic components like color, orientation, and the borders of the object. This allows it to determine that the image represents a box. However, top-down processing builds upon these initial conclusions to speed up the recognition process by using previously made decisions. This can help identify the object as a specific box, rather than a hole in the background.\n\nOnce information has been processed to a certain point, an attention filter decides its significance and determines which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, even though the brain processes every blade of grass when looking at shoes, a healthy attention filter ensures that we don't notice individual blades. On the other hand, we might focus on our name being spoken in a noisy room. There are multiple stages of processing, and the results are repeatedly modulated by attention.\n\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. The process starts with encoding, where information is converted into a form that can be stored. Various types of encoding exist for different types of sensory inputs. For example, verbal input can be encoded based on how it looks, how it sounds, or what it means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Research on animals suggests that working memory, which stores information for around 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal that temporarily loops through a series of neurons. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained through the structure of specific types of proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models explaining how knowledge is organized in the brain, based on various approaches such as human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, which are linked based on their relatedness. For instance, in this model, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which could be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In his dystopian novel Brave New World, Aldous Huxley critiques the impending dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the capitalistic framework that sustains it. The society in the novel prioritizes communal harmony over individuality, conditioning its citizens from birth to pursue instant gratification above all else. This results in people being reduced to mere pawns in a larger game, confined to a single ideology dictated by the World Controller. Upon analyzing the novel through the lens of Marxist ideology, it becomes evident that Huxley harbors suspicions about the development of these systems. The presence of Marxist terminology such as homogeny and reification underscores the notion that Brave New World is a commentary on the shortcomings of the emerging economic systems of Huxley's time.\n\nHuxley satirizes capitalism by employing the concept of false consciousness, a Marxist thesis which suggests that the common citizenry is kept in the dark about their true relationships with other economic classes, prioritizing personal gain instead. This is achieved through the ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, which is exemplified in the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The lower classes, represented by Delta and Gamma, lack genuine autonomy, with their drive to consume and indulge strengthened through hypnopædia. This manipulation is orchestrated by the World Controller. The novel also illustrates the concept of hegemony, where a dominant group exercises control over others, in this case, the upper classes. The lower classes are oblivious to this manipulation, blindly embracing an ideology that perpetuates the existing structure. In contrast, the upper classes, such as Alphas and Betas, are aware of the manipulation but choose to accept their position, with few exceptions. The interactions between social classes in the novel serve as a testament to the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nThe novel portrays relationships between individuals as superficial, with characters lacking depth and distinction, even among major characters. Huxley may be suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism erodes human free will and self-expression. Love and extreme emotions are nonexistent, replaced by shallow interactions that focus on physical appearances and superficial connections. The societal classes' complacency with their positions in the hierarchy and their absolute obedience to their role in the community reflect the Marxist concept of the proletariat, who are led to believe they are superior as long as they conform and consume.",
            "I have been enrolled in University Park for approximately two and a half years, with four and a half semesters under my belt. For many students, including myself, navigating the campus can be a significant challenge. During my freshman year, I resided in an East Halls dorm, situated on the easternmost part of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. The commute from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in buildings like the Willard building, located near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, particularly on inclement days. I recall speaking with an alumnus, not much older than myself, who shared that the East Halls dorms used to be separated from the rest of the university by large tracts of unused land. However, this vacant space has since been transformed into sports fields, new buildings, such as the Creamery and health services facility, and surrounded by apartments. As the campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another is becoming increasingly difficult. An effective solution to this problem is the bicycle, which is especially beneficial on a college campus. Nevertheless, simply owning a bike is not enough – students need to actually ride them, and the campus infrastructure must be designed with bicyclists in mind.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who has resumed cycling after a hiatus of several years. He expressed his surprise at having stopped riding in the first place, stating, \"Bikes are great; for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the most practical way to get around.\" Bicycling offers numerous physical benefits and is also an efficient means of transportation. With a bowl of oatmeal and some physical exertion, you can cover distances of 30 miles or more. Like many of my peers, I now reside off campus, just as far from the campus center as some dorms. This semester, I made the astute decision to purchase a bike, which has greatly improved my daily routine. With classes in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my home, biking cuts down the time to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly enough. However, the most direct route to Thomas building from my home is Pollock Road, which is not always an easy road to navigate, whether on a bike or on foot. While walking has its advantages, I am too busy to walk. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily routine, resulting in over two and a half hours per week. Considering the cumulative time spent walking to and from classes, appointments, and other commitments, I would be left with little time for anything else."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "As I pursue a degree in social work, my goal is to embark on a career path within the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on supporting children who have been abused or neglected, as well as helping troubled families. The values I plan to bring to this field include a commitment to providing service, showing respect, maintaining an ethical approach, and continually enhancing my professional skills to stay up-to-date in my field. These core values not only guide social workers, but they are also deeply personal to me.\n\nI have always been driven to make a positive impact on others, but I initially struggled to identify a specific career path. Through my experiences in high school and college, I witnessed individuals coping with problems in unhealthy ways, which led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break, still uncertain about my career path. One summer, I visited a friend whose sixteen-year-old guest was trying to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that the teenager had contacted the police, and I accompanied them to his parents' residence to offer assistance. The police asked me to speak with the parents, as they were unable to intervene directly. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed evasive and made excuses for their son's behavior. This experience deepened my commitment to a career in social work, specifically to help families resolve conflicts and address the root causes of problems.\n\nAnother essential value for the field of social work is social justice. Our society often emphasizes the importance of individuality and mourns the loss of unique individuals. However, we often prioritize conformity over actual individuality. As someone who values being true to myself, I don't believe in limiting myself to fit in with the majority. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively spoke out against social injustices whenever I could, expressing myself through my appearance, my involvement with the GSBA, and other forms of activism. I firmly believe in the principles of social justice and will continue to advocate for equality and fairness.",
            "This paper delves into the biological and sociocultural models that pertain to insomnia, a disorder that affects an individual's sleep patterns. The biological model emphasizes the genetic and medical factors contributing to insomnia, while the sociocultural model examines the environmental and social influences, such as race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review aims to review and critique the research related to these models, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each study.\n\nInsomnia can be classified as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder associated with another mental health condition, or a sleep disorder resulting from medical complications or substance use. The primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, with Dyssomnias encompassing various conditions such as insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, and circadian rhythm sleep disorder. These disorders involve difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep or staying awake for an extended period. On the other hand, Parasomnias are characterized by abnormal behaviors or physiological occurrences during sleep, such as nightmares, sleep terrors, and sleepwalking.\n\nSleep disorders can also be linked to mental health conditions, specifically those categorized under Axis I (clinical disorders) and Axis II (personality disorders or mental retardation). The focus of this review is on insomnia and primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders explores the genetic and physiological aspects of sleep regulation. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus, particularly those containing orexin, play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study involving mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are responsible for sleep-wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while its inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and improved sleep quality. Furthermore, the study found that a GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep duration in mice. These findings suggest that animal models can be applied to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence of this receptor could lead to sleep disturbances, even without the use of medication. From a sociocultural perspective, this study implies that the inherited phenotype of the receptor could regulate sleep, and any alterations to it could naturally disrupt sleep patterns, affecting various aspects of life, including daily tasks and work performance.",
            "This paper will delve into three key areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with a concise explanation of the disorder, providing an understanding of what CAPD entails. Following this, the diagnostic process for CAPD is explored, highlighting common characteristics or 'red flags' that indicate its presence. Finally, the paper will discuss practical strategies that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom can employ to support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to the brain's efficiency in processing auditory information. It is essentially a neurological condition where the brain struggles to interpret and differentiate sounds, despite the individual having normal hearing. As a result, people with CAPD are not considered hearing-impaired; they can hear sounds clearly, but their brain fails to effectively process and separate them, making it challenging to distinguish between words, conversations, and background noises.\n\nThe concept of CAPD first emerged in the mid-1950s under the name 'auditory imperception' (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), as researchers investigated children with communication disorders. In 1954, the Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing assessment tools for these children, while in 1961, Kimura introduced a novel method called dichotic testing and proposed a model explaining the physiological basis of dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference held in 1977 sparked further research into children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests itself in various ways, including difficulties in localizing sounds in space, distinguishing between multiple sounds, recognizing sound patterns, and detecting changes in speech, such as sarcasm. Additionally, individuals with CAPD may experience sound interference, making it challenging to interpret complex auditory cues and sequence auditory information accurately (Ferre).\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a thorough evaluation is necessary, involving systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests, which may be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals using a range of assessments that evaluate auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). These assessments may include questionnaires, surveys, and observation of auditory behaviors in response to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single, universally accepted diagnostic tool or test for CAPD, and the underlying causes of the disorder remain unknown. Diagnostic tests often involve presenting the individual with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and asking them to differentiate specific items, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the brain's response to these signals.",
            "The play Twelfth Night suggests that disguises can initially be effective in deceiving others, but ultimately, one must abandon the guise to avoid losing their true identity. However, the process of revealing deception can lead to feelings of isolation, making it a difficult decision between self-preservation and preserving relationships with others. While some people may respond calmly to discovering they've been deceived, others may be offended and react negatively.\n\nThe theme of deception through gender role reversal in Twelfth Night raises additional questions, particularly why the character feels the need to hide their true identity and adopt a disguise. Viola, for instance, resorts to disguising herself as a man to protect herself from potential threats while in a foreign land. Although her plan succeeds, it separates her from her female support network and creates complications, including Olivia's confusion of her with her twin brother Sebastian and Orsino's suppressed romantic feelings for her.\n\nTo the modern reader, Twelfth Night can be seen as an example of how deception can facilitate the recognition and exploration of repressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. The play hints that these characters may be driven by unexpressed desires, which are revealed through Viola/Cesario's presence. Olivia's sudden shift in affection from Cesario to Sebastian, as well as her subsequent view of Cesario/Viola as family rather than a romantic partner, may suggest that Olivia is mocking those who judge people based on their appearance, rather than true feelings.",
            "The German colonial regime has been criticized for its harsh treatment, particularly with regards to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge the complexity and diversity of the German colonial administration. The educational systems put in place across the colonies were varied, and even within the same territory, policies and ruling styles differed significantly. When Britain took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a sizable population of well-educated and literate Africans. Similarly, German educational efforts in colonies such as Kamerun were praised by contemporary writers. \n\nHowever, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the government actively supported and established state schools for native education, in South West Africa, the responsibility of educating the indigenous population was largely left to missionary societies that received limited government assistance. \n\nNotably, the government invested considerable resources in the education of European settlers in the colony, establishing a system of state schools and heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. The outcomes of these educational policies persisted in South West Africa long after German rule ended. While many other German colonies showed significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, the vast majority of the population remained illiterate and without access to education. A range of social, political, and economic factors contributed to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper aims to expand the discussion by examining these factors, with a particular focus on new research regarding the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nA substantial body of literature exists on education in the German colonial empire, with the majority of these sources being in German and written during or shortly after the colonial period. The early works primarily focused on describing the educational systems of the colonies, while later studies in English expanded the discourse by conducting comparative analyses of education in various German colonies and more in-depth examinations of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted the significant differences in educational systems across the colonies. A notable work that explicitly addresses the topic of this paper is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa, which compares the educational systems of the two colonies and identifies the factors contributing to their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa is a key factor that explains many of the distinctive aspects of the colony's educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, despite being largely covered in arid desert. This relatively hospitable environment is reflected in the European population, with nearly 15,000 whites residing in South West Africa by 1913, compared to only 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "Over the past 100 years, the classification of popular music has become increasingly complex due to the proliferation of numerous genres. This complexity is further exacerbated by the fact that many prominent genres, such as rock, jazz, country, and folk, have given rise to a multitude of subgenres and sub-subgenres. Among these, heavy metal rock has emerged as one of the most diverse and expressive genres in the past four decades. Characterized by its capacity to convey a wide range of emotions, heavy metal music often leans towards the darker aspects of the emotional spectrum, making it both expressive and diverse.\n\nThe evolution of heavy metal has led to a fragmentation of the genre, with various niches and sub-subgenres emerging over time. As a result, it has become challenging to define the essence of heavy metal music. To understand the contemporary metal music scene, it is essential to grasp the roots and essence of the metal movement.\n\nAt its core, the metal movement is defined by its association with darkness, which is reflected in its emphasis on \"more\" – more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more theatricality. Metal music often features complex, technically proficient musicianship, setting it apart from other genres. Moreover, the metal movement has a strong connection to the use of psychedelic substances, which influenced the creation of some of its most iconic records. The genre's dark, visceral qualities, which were novel in the music scene at the time, have been shaped by various influences, including the Romantic Era's emphasis on the darker aspects of human emotion. The lyrics of classic metal songs, such as \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles, exemplify the genre's affinity for expressing the darker side of human experience.\n\n\"Helter Skelter\" is a notable example of a song that pushed the boundaries of heaviness and darkness in music, with its lyrics and melody reflecting the turbulent, drug-induced state of its creators. This song is often cited as one of the pioneering works of the heavy metal genre, and its release on The White Album was a deliberate attempt by the Beatles to demonstrate their ability to create music that was just as intense as that of the Rolling Stones.",
            "Before the Surrealist artists appeared on the scene, Henri Rousseau was busily creating his own dreamscapes, both literally and figuratively, through his artwork. His 1910 painting, The Dream, is a poignant representation not only of a woman experiencing wonder in a dream world, but also of Rousseau's own aspirations and ambitions as an artist. Since beginning his career, Rousseau had longed for recognition, acclaim, and appreciation from his peers and art enthusiasts. However, this aspiration came with an inner conflict - to conform to established styles to gain acceptance from the art world, or to remain true to his unique vision and artistic voice. The Dream is a powerful reflection of this ongoing internal struggle, one that defined Rousseau's artistic journey.\n\nTo understand The Dream, it's essential to delve into Rousseau's background. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, Rousseau came from a relatively prosperous family. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle. Despite lacking formal artistic training, Rousseau spent decades working for the French municipal toll service, earning a humble living as a gabelou. However, he gained a misleading nickname, douanier, or customs inspector. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children left Rousseau with a single child, Julia, and immense grief. This traumatic event prompted him to seek solace in painting as a means of comfort and new beginnings. Unlike his contemporaries who often romanticized peasants in their art, Rousseau was a folk painter who drew inspiration from the everyday life and aspirations of the common people.\n\nRousseau's desire for recognition in the art world is understandable, given his circumstances. He started his artistic journey late in life, without formal training, and during a time when many talented and well-known artists were already active. His breakthrough came around the same time Matisse began establishing himself as an artist. According to art historian Jan Gordon, while both artists competed in the art world, they differed significantly in style, subject matter, and motivations. Matisse sought to avoid clichés in his work, whereas Rousseau aimed to create conventional art that would earn him acceptance into the prestigious Artiste Français.",
            "There's a long-standing philosophical connection between ethics and aesthetics, and it's rooted in the idea that truth and beauty are inextricably linked. The notion that ethics and beauty are intertwined is not merely a coincidence; it's deeply ingrained in our understanding of the world. As John Keats poignantly expressed in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" beauty is truth, and truth is beauty. This understanding transcends traditional forms of learning, such as education or experience. Instead, it's an inherent aspect of our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics, which are more about describing and interpreting than prescribing specific rules.\n\nWhen it comes to art and morals, our attempts to analyze and critique them often fall short of grasping their essence. For example, discussions about a masterpiece like da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on technical aspects like composition, contrast, and cultural context, but these elements alone cannot fully explain why it's a masterpiece. When people discuss their favorite works of art or literature, they often use phrases like \"there's just something about it,\" implying that there's something intangible and ineffable that cannot be captured by words.\n\nThis is similar to what authors like Flannery O'Connor said about storytelling; it's a way to convey complex ideas that cannot be expressed through straightforward statements. Similarly, ethics has a transcendent quality that cannot be fully described or reduced to a set of qualities. Ludwig Wittgenstein's statement that ethics cannot be expressed and is transcendental resonates with this idea. This intangible aspect of both art and morality is their most powerful attribute, and it's what connects them.\n\nThe connection between ethics and aesthetics is strengthened by the fact that we experience both at a deep, intuitive level, which is often described as noumenal in philosophical terms. This experience is difficult to put into words but is essential to our understanding of both art and morality. Literature, in particular, is distinct from other art forms in its moral qualities, as argued by McKean. While moral standards may not apply to other art forms like music, they are central to literature and its ability to shape our values and understanding of the world. Ultimately, literature is valuable because it reflects and influences our moral compass.",
            "Germany today is a powerful nation with its unique cultural heritage, stretching from the Alps in southern Munich to the Baltic Sea in Kiel, as well as from the Rhine River city of Cologne to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River. This diverse cultural identity is a blend of influences from various sources and tribes. The origins of the term \"Germania\" are shrouded in mystery, with different scholars and historians presenting competing theories. \n\nThe name \"Germania\" is often attributed to the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, according to the Roman historian Tacitus. However, Julius Caesar, who wrote about the Gallic Wars, first used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the Gauls and the Germanic tribes that crossed the Rhine River. Caesar borrowed the term from the Gauls, possibly referring to a neighboring tribe in their language. Another theory suggests that the name \"German\" comes from the word \"ger,\" meaning a type of spear used in warfare, or the Old Irish word \"garim,\" which implies that the Germans were loud or noisy.\n\nTacitus' work, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" written in AD 98, portrays the Germans as an indigenous people who were not significantly influenced by other cultures through migration or intermarriage. He attributes their geographical isolation to the harsh climate, rugged terrain, and unforgiving nature of the region, making it unlikely that people would voluntarily settle there. The Romans, while exploring and conquering Germanic tribes, primarily sent expeditions to trade and acquire resources rather than establishing a permanent presence. As a result, the Germanic tribes interacted with the Roman Empire through trade and military service, shaping their distinct cultural identity.",
            "As I stood there, my mind was blank, taking in the scene before me without processing any emotions. My thoughts flowed in quickly, barely lingering before disappearing again, making it seem like my consciousness was simply observing the scene in front of me without any personal thoughts. This mental state allowed me to experience the world in a fluid way, almost like a detached observer.\n\nThis state of mind was familiar to me, thanks to an artist I worked with who recommended a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had been interested in drawing since I was six, and this book provided a comprehensive guide to learning the art, covering even the basics, such as understanding the properties of a pencil and how our brains interpret lines. The book suggested a technique where you place a frame around the subject you're studying, simplifying a complex image by removing distracting details. \n\nAt that moment, looking at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't mentally impose this frame. I was overwhelmed by the complexity of the scene, so I stood in awe, taking it all in. I thought about the artistic styles of famous artists – Picasso's blue phase, Monet's love of greenery, and the Renaissance masters' use of a wide range of colors. If I wanted to call myself an artist, I felt like I was at the beginning of creating my own work, the start of my story, and I had titled it \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingers landed on my chosen drawing tool, and my hand prepared to create. I focused on the moment, and my hand moved through the air, bringing my creative vision to life. Water swirled and flowed, and a small piece broke away from the whole, disappearing into nothingness. As I tried again, my hand clenched and jerked a bit more forcefully, and I slapped the toilet handle harder, trying to dislodge the uncooperative brown mass stuck at the bottom.\n\nWith the mop in hand, I stood with my feet shoulder-width apart, my green tie awkwardly knotted around my neck, and I frowned at the unpleasant package left for the bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid. After a few more attempts to flush it and a few more moments of introspection, I finally reached for the toilet paper roll on my right, grabbed it, and wrapped my hand in it like a glove. I stood up straight, then bent forward, and slowly submerged my hand into the bowl, mimicking the movement of a mother covering a turkey for Thanksgiving dinner.",
            "The alarming rate of teenage driver fatalities is a concerning issue in the United States.  Several factors contribute to this tragic statistic, including the fact that the adolescent brain is not fully equipped to handle the risks associated with driving.  Additionally, the inexperience of teen drivers is a significant factor in the high number of accidents, rollovers, speeding, and vehicles leaving the road.  Furthermore, when teens drive with their peers, the risk of accidents increases, as highlighted by a study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, which found a correlation between the age of passengers and the number of traffic accidents.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, several states have implemented provisional licenses that restrict the hours teens can drive and prohibit minors from being passengers.  However, I believe that these measures are temporary solutions.  The underlying issue is that, statistically, young drivers are not adequately prepared to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving.  Researcher Marvin Zuckerman suggests that 18 may be too young for a regular driver's license, as individuals under 19-20 tend to seek thrills and take risks.  It would be wise to delay driving until this tendency subsides.  If we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, the number of fatal accidents is likely to rise, and the death toll could reach catastrophic levels.  By 2010, millions of new teen drivers will be on the road, including the children of the Baby Boomers.\n\nImplementing legislation to address this issue would be a straightforward process.  Schools could continue to provide driver's education classes to prepare future drivers, but no one under 18 could operate a vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued before a full license is granted, and practical driving hours would still be required.  The number of required hours could be based on the existing standards of most states, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.  Uniform national legislation would provide a reasonable and effective means of protecting teen drivers across the country.  This proposal is not a new idea, but rather a necessary step to address the alarming statistics surrounding teenage driver fatalities.",
            "While reviewing the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to examine all 15 trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films frequently rely on creative editing techniques to create illusions. My analysis primarily focused on analyzing the aesthetic principles underlying the majority of these trick films and identifying unique characteristics in a select few that deviated from the norm in later years. During this period, trick films were largely static, confined to a single set, and adhered to a strict rule of one shot per film, using a frontal proscenium composition, long shots, and no camera movement. However, some early 20th-century films broke away from these conventions by incorporating elements such as multi-shot scenes.\n\nOne distinctive trait shared by these trick films is the filming of interior scenes within a frontal proscenium framework. The camera remains stationary, never moving to follow characters or objects. This composition was a common feature in early cinema and drew inspiration from the theater and vaudeville/magic performances. A limitation of this approach is that characters typically move horizontally and do not approach or recede from the camera, as seen in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis.\n\nThe use of the frontal proscenium style also led to the prevalence of long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-up shots were never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog, a practice borrowed from the theater and vaudeville, where the audience would view the entire performance within the confines of the stage. As was common in early cinema, actors rarely moved towards the camera, making close-ups virtually non-existent.\n\nMost early trick films followed a pattern where a single conceptual shot equaled a film, limiting their length to around a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This also restricted the narrative or dramatic potential of these films, which mainly featured short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearance, and switching acts with minimal storytelling. However, it's worth noting that in trick films, a single conceptual shot may consist of multiple physical shots combined to create an illusion of disappearance or appearance. A closer inspection of The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film, reveals the moment when the physical shot containing Mary's severed head begins, even though the entire film is perceived as a single shot by the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate for Republicanism, despite primarily being an agriculturalist. His profession and brief career in politics shaped him into a dedicated and outspoken individual who prioritized personal freedom and limited government. His strong connection to an agrarian system underpinned his views on government, as he sought to preserve and promote this perceived superior career path. This emphasis on his primary occupation colored his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judiciary.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to establish an ideal system, unencumbered by native traditions that might hinder its development. He firmly believed in the natural rights of individuals, which he saw as interconnected and essential. These rights should not be subject to government interference, as their denial would undermine the entire system. He argued that the concept of a \"state of nature\" often exploited the strong and cunning, but this was not an acceptable norm in a civilized society.\n\nTo create a perfect society, Taylor argued that the government must account for both the good and evil inherent in human nature. He rigidly adhered to a dualistic morality, asserting that government, being a human institution, would inevitably reflect both its virtues and vices. He believed that good principles, such as protecting private property, promoting agriculture, and discouraging excessive capitalism, would form the foundation of a fair government. This government would function equitably, irrespective of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by self-interest and avarice. However, self-interest was only considered a vice when it led to the exploitation of others. A well-designed government was necessary to manage humanity's natural flaws and prevent the introduction of bad principles.\n\nLike many Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, advocating for a limited federal government with powers explicitly stated in the document. He recognized that a broad federal government would be expensive and potentially tyrannical. However, he also believed that a literal interpretation without consideration for the Founding Fathers' intent could be misleading and prone to corruption. Furthermore, Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defined the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking at Figure 17, we can see a significant drop in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project, which was somewhat concerning. The reasons behind this decline are unclear, but several factors might have contributed. At our New England campus, the onset of winter often results in fewer people commuting by bike or on foot. Additionally, the end of the fall semester in December means students and faculty are preoccupied with finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and other tasks, which may have pushed the commuter log to the backburner. Furthermore, December marks the start of the holiday season, leading to a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many don't need to come to campus. When classes resume in late January, the number of log submissions remained low, suggesting a possible connection. However, the numbers for February were even lower, leaving the reason for this decline unclear. It's possible that initial enthusiasm for the project naturally waned over time, which is a common phenomenon in such initiatives. To counteract this, we organized the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign to revitalize the project, which led to an increase in log submissions. \n\nOne of the challenges we faced with this project is that people generally enjoy the freedom and flexibility of driving their cars, a deeply ingrained aspect of our culture. To encourage alternative commuting methods, we offered prizes in the form of gift cards to local businesses. While this was a successful strategy, it would have been interesting to see the impact of offering larger prizes, such as a new bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have helped sustain the project's momentum, particularly during the dip in engagement we experienced. The value of the prizes remained constant throughout the project, which may have contributed to the decline in participation. If the prizes had been increased over time, with the addition of more substantial rewards in December and January, it's likely that participation and engagement would have increased instead of decreased.",
            "A security known as an exchange-traded fund (ETF) is designed to track an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund, while being more flexible and traded like a stock on an exchange.  ETFs offer the diversification benefits of an index fund and the advantages of owning individual stocks, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as few as one share per transaction.  Although these benefits are highly appealing, ETFs have significantly lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund.  However, there are some drawbacks, including the cost of paying a commission on any ETF trade, similar to paying for a stock order.  Additionally, ETFs offer a wide variety of funds to choose from.  It is essential for the astute financial investor to critically evaluate whether the stated benefits, such as diversification, are indeed present and to what extent they exist.  For the purposes of this analysis, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it to its top 10 holdings to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF are comparable to those of a diversified portfolio of the same 10 stocks, as well as whether there are more optimal configurations of the same stocks that could provide a better risk-return ratio.\n\nTo make the evaluation manageable, we have decided to focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's total assets.  Below are the top 10 holdings and their respective percentages of total assets.\n\nTo gauge how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, to estimate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio consisted entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF's holdings.  The calculations of Beta and Return are presented in the chart below.\n\nFrom the data in the chart, it is clear that a portfolio consisting solely of the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  The results thus far suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could offer higher returns with a lower risk.  Nevertheless, it is possible that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\nTo determine whether these portfolios are statistically different, we have calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% for comparison to the ETF IHF's accumulated standard deviation.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's notable poems is \"Dream-Land,\" in which he prominently features the term \"Thulé.\" Poe's use of this term can be linked to Virgil, who mentioned an island north of Britain as the edge of the known world. However, Poe's inspiration for Thulé may also have been influenced by German literature, which he was known to be interested in. \n\nA notable example of Poe's familiarity with German authors, including Goethe, can be seen in the similarity between their works. Karl J. Arndt notes the resemblance between \"Poe's Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon,\" suggesting that Poe may have been drawing inspiration from Goethe. \n\nAccording to the Oxford Companion to English Literature, Goethe's work \"Faust\" is a celebrated poetic drama that was published in two parts in 1808 and 1832. Within the second part, there is a poem called \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells the story of a king who is consumed by grief after the loss of his wife. This poem bears a striking resemblance to the character in Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" with both featuring a sense of despair and a reliance on drinking to cope with emotional pain.\n\nInterestingly, Goethe's \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term Thulé in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe references Thulé twice in his collected works, using the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and incorporating it as a bookend in \"Dream-Land.\" The parallels between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" suggest that they can be read as companion pieces, with both exploring themes of loss and loneliness. \n\nGiven Poe's admiration for Tennyson and the widespread reproduction of Goethe's work, it is likely that Poe was familiar with Goethe's writing, which suggests that he may have drawn inspiration from \"The King of Thulé\" when creating his own \"Dream-Land.\"",
            "In California, if a customer suffered an injury after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store, they may be eligible for punitive damages if the store manager acted with malicious intent. A court is unlikely to immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To justify an award of punitive damages, a plaintiff must provide evidence that the defendant's actions were taken with a reckless disregard for the potential harm that could result from their behavior, as well as that the conduct itself was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have anticipated the potential harm of not cleaning the spill, given that multiple customers had previously slipped and fallen in the store in the months leading up to her accident. She will also argue that Martin's failure to have the spill cleaned, despite being aware of the potential risks, demonstrates a willful and conscious disregard for customer safety. While Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable is not as strong, it is still a reasonable claim, especially considering that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009 and Martin failed to take adequate measures to ensure store safety. \n\nOn October 13th, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee of D&D Markets, Rich Wayne, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin responded by stating he was on dinner break and unavailable to deal with customer complaints. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin of the spill, and he gave the same response. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, suffering a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, there had been five reported slip-and-fall incidents at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment on the punitive damage claim. \n\nIn California law, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not based on a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" California Civil Code section 3294(a) defines malice as conduct that was intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when it was committed with a deliberate disregard of the plaintiff's rights when the defendant was aware of the potential dangerous consequences of their actions and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences, as seen in the case of Taylor v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County, 598 P.2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "It has been almost four years since I took a course in Islam at CBC, where one of the most debated topics was whether Islam is inherently hostile. In my opinion, this question remains highly relevant today, particularly when considering the shift in mass media's perception of Islam and extremists since 9/11.  What's striking is the transformation from a hostile view to an extreme level of tolerance for Islam in America. This shift is exemplified by the fact that in 2001, it would have been unimaginable to have a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, who has a clear Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad fascinates me. Contrary to my previous understanding of his history, the biography depicts him as a humble martyr rather than a conqueror who forced conversions to Islam. According to my initial knowledge, Muhammad was known to conquer and assimilate tribes, forcing them to adopt Islam. However, the biography portrays him as a leader who was often misunderstood, and his humility eventually won over those who came to understand his message.\n\nI've also noticed eerie similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles attributed to Muhammad. One notable example is when Muhammad miraculously multiplied mutton and milk to feed a large group of people. This narrative style suggests that the authors aimed to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove himself but lived a life of truth and miracles. This approach downplays the significance of Jesus' life and ministry, almost as if they're borrowing and attempting to supplant the essence of Jesus' personhood with Muhammad's story.\n\nThe biography also contains numerous accounts that appear to be intended to provide evidence of the 'witness' or 'conversion' of individuals to Islam. However, many of these stories are presented from a third-party perspective, which undermines their credibility. The stories often originate from hearsay, making it seem suspicious and diminishing their impact.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the attempt to portray Muhammad as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle figure. However, historical records contradict this image of Muhammad, leading me to wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true circumstances surrounding his rise to power.",
            "The core teachings of Jesus and the ideals he promoted during his lifetime were initially overlooked as Christianity evolved beyond his era.  When examining the history of Christianity, we observe a pattern where the faith has gradually strayed further away from its roots.  Today, society is witnessing an increasing awareness and a progressive shift towards a more refined understanding.  While traditionalists continue to hold onto their conventional views and resist any departure from established teachings, their influence may not be substantial enough to dictate the broader direction.  As the years pass, a growing awareness of historical context among Christians will emerge, sparking a desire to distinguish between the original intent of Jesus' teachings and the additional doctrines that were incorporated over time.  This process may take centuries, but it is inevitable that Christianity will eventually undergo a significant reversal, returning to its original form.  As this trend spreads across the United States and Europe, it will inspire a movement to strip away the layers of doctrine, gradually stripping back to the essence of Jesus' message, as it was presented before other thinkers and interpretations took hold.  When this shift affects the masses in these regions, the church as an institution will still maintain its strength, guiding the way forward.  As a result of this reversal, the extreme diversity within Christianity will give way to increased uniformity of belief and practice.  The distinctions between regions, denominations, and other divisions will be replaced by growing similarities.  History is replete with examples of reversals, such as the Roman Empire's shift from persecution to Christian dominance, or the transformation of the United States from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The impending reversal in Christianity will unfold in a similar manner, as the faith seeks to reclaim its roots and, in the process, reduces diversity.  It is essential to note that a key factor in making this reversal possible will be the adoption of a more metaphorical interpretation of Jesus' words, rather than viewing them as literal statements of fact.  To understand the trajectory of Christianity, it is necessary to look back to its origins in Judaism, which was the theological foundation of the Christian faith.  By examining the period before the Roman Empire's control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., we find that Judaism was characterized by a rich diversity of perspectives, with the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and ordinary people each holding distinct views.",
            "The Jungle highlights the inherent self-centered nature of human beings. At their core, people prioritize their own interests over others and seek to improve their lives at the expense of those around them. This is exemplified in the factory owners and managers of Packingtown, who are only driven by the desire to expand their businesses and accumulate wealth, disregarding the impact on the environment and those affected by their operations. Upton Sinclair vividly illustrates this in his description of the factories: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This image serves as a stark representation of the devastating consequences of their actions, such as pollution and environmental degradation. The owners and managers display a callous disregard for the well-being of their employees, using them as mere means to an end. They exploit their workers, pushing them to work excessively long hours and laying them off without warning or support, all in pursuit of profit. During the time period depicted in the novel, there were few laws or regulations protecting workers' safety and well-being, allowing the factory owners and managers to operate with impunity. The workers in Packingtown were expected to endure deplorable working conditions and treatment, with no access to information or assistance. Although some unions formed to represent the workers, they often profited from their struggles, making the situation even more dire. The workers were described as being in a state of servitude, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many authors employ various techniques to evoke specific feelings or attitudes in their readers towards essential subjects. Some of these methods are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes a range of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. He frequently employs an uncommon combination of adjectives and nouns to create a distinct atmosphere surrounding a subject. Alternatively, he assigns meaning to a symbol and later utilizes it to achieve a particular effect. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald develops and utilizes the meaning of several colors, including gold, green, white, and red/pink, to convey specific emotions and ideas.\n\nFitzgerald creates associations for colors such as white/gray and red/pink, and then leverages these meanings to create a particular impression of an object. The meaning he assigns to white/gray is uniformity, with white representing a more refined and upper-class atmosphere, while gray implies something older and faded. To establish this meaning, Fitzgerald consistently uses both colors in the novel's beginning. White is repeatedly associated with characters such as Daisy and Jordan, who are often depicted wearing white. For instance, Nick wears \"white flannels\" to Gatsby's party, and Tom wears a \"white shirt\" when meeting Myrtle. Fitzgerald reinforces this connection by describing mundane, unimportant subjects with these colors, such as the \"white chasms of lower New York\" and the \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable.\n\nFitzgerald further develops this meaning by applying these colors to common or unremarkable people and places. He describes Jordan and Daisy's past as a \"white girlhood,\" and the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes. The dog-seller is portrayed as a \"gray old man.\" After establishing these associations, Fitzgerald uses white/gray to signify a sense of uniformity or lack of importance. This technique is first employed when describing Daisy. After a period of limited use of these colors, Fitzgerald reintroduces Daisy dressed in white, which contributes to her characterization as a uniform, interchangeable entity, something Gatsby desires but also longs for. He repeats this technique to reinforce this impression, using images such as a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and her appearance in a \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County boasts significant agricultural output, primarily due to its favorable climate characterized by mild temperatures and ample sunlight. The region's agricultural sector includes a wide variety of crops such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial demand for locally sourced, organic produce in the area, with many community-supported agriculture initiatives having lengthy waiting lists for their products. Organic dairy and poultry products are also in high demand. Many local farms provide opportunities for visitors to explore their operations, as well as engage in recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching. By adopting organic farming practices, landowners can take advantage of government incentives while enhancing biodiversity, creating opportunities for ecotourism, and generating revenue through educational programs.\n\nIn addition to catering to a potentially lucrative market niche, organic farming often leads to increased biodiversity in the area due to the absence of chemical usage. However, organic farming can be more labor-intensive and costly than conventional methods, particularly when it comes to pest control and soil fertilization. Additionally, small organic farms often lack the efficiency and economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations. Other conservation practices, unrelated to organic farming, can also incur higher labor costs, including the use of cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to create specific habitats.\n\nA hypothetical landowner in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expert guidance to optimize both profit and habitat quality. \n\nThe hypothetical land in question is located adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California, and spans 160 acres of chaparral, non-native grasslands, and oak woodlands, situated next to the Cleveland National Forest. This area falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered or threatened with listing, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nHistorically, this region was inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 19th century. The land in question was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and/or wood production over the intervening decades.\n\nTo provide a realistic example of a farming operation in this area, I selected a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to determine the options available to small-scale farmers for reducing costs and preserving wildlife-friendly practices. I also identified an organic farm in the same region as a model for what a landowner might aim to achieve.",
            "In negotiations, understanding and accounting for cultural differences is crucial. Culture encompasses a wide range of nuances that cannot be defined by a single characteristic or trait. Stereotypes, such as \"Russians are stubborn\" or \"Japanese are accommodating,\" oversimplify the complexities of a culture and are often inaccurate. A more effective approach is to comprehend the specific cultural values and attitudes relevant to the negotiation at hand, as they can significantly impact the dynamic at the bargaining table. When interacting with a foreign culture, one tends to draw comparisons to their own, which can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nTo navigate cultural differences, it is essential to delve into the culture, its history, and values, rather than judging or trying to alter them. Acceptance and understanding of the culture, particularly when dealing with a weaker bargaining position, can facilitate a smoother negotiation. When on unfamiliar territory, respecting local customs and traditions can help break down cultural barriers and facilitate progress.\n\nIt is essential to recognize that culture extends beyond national or international boundaries. Companies within a nation develop their unique corporate cultures, shaped by factors such as work hours, communication styles, hiring practices, and dress codes. These differences can be observed within a single nation, as seen in the varying corporate cultures across the United States. The apparent uniformity of certain cultures can be misleading, and it is crucial to look beyond the surface to uncover the complexities.\n\nUnderstanding a culture's values is particularly vital, as they provide insight into the underlying motivations and priorities. For instance, in cultures where saving face or communal harmony is valued, a negotiator will avoid publicly embarrassing their company or superior. On the other hand, in cultures that prioritize a hard-driven bargain, negotiators may be more likely to push for a favorable deal. Considering these cultural factors beforehand can significantly enhance the effectiveness of a negotiation. Nevertheless, gaining a deeper understanding of one's counterpart on a personal level can also be invaluable in achieving a successful negotiation.",
            "The famous phrase \"The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" originates in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is at the forefront of St. Anselm's argument for God's existence. This notion is also shared by Thomas Aquinas. Since both authors defend the same concept, it's essential to assume they are correct in their belief in the God of the Bible for the sake of comparison. If we were to consider a deity that differs from the one in whom our authors believe, we wouldn't be able to properly compare their arguments, as they are fundamentally centered around a specific idea of God. \n\nWhile each author presents valid points, neither provides a comprehensive foundation for believing in God. To demonstrate this, let's first examine St. Anselm's argument. Anselm's reasoning relies on gaining understanding through faith, exploring one's own consciousness to find proof of God. He suggests that God's existence is inherent within our understanding, making it impossible to conceive of his nonexistence. Although the specifics of Anselm's argument can be wordy and confusing, the core idea is that the proof for God lies within our minds and doesn't necessitate any external evidence. This concept of accepting something without definitive empirical proof is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas proposes that God's existence can be proven solely through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith altogether. This approach would be advantageous in evangelism, a crucial aspect of Christianity, as it would enable the recruitment of new followers without relying on their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. Instead, Aquinas employs logical arguments based on change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony to demonstrate the logical necessity of God's existence. He illustrates that understanding the characteristics of a missing puzzle piece is possible through the assembly of the rest of the puzzle, even if the piece itself is not visible.",
            "It is believed that around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince destined to be known as the Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he renounced worldly life and achieved enlightenment, which led to the establishment of Buddhism, specifically the Theravada tradition. Although the religion is now over 2,500 years old, it has undergone significant changes, as seen in countries like Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. This event, attended by both monks and laypeople, holds spiritual significance, despite the Buddha never mentioning a similar celebration. These changes can be observed in both the surface-level customs and the core teachings of Buddhism. The Theravada Buddhist community has adapted its core principles over time, influenced by both internal and external forces, which may be either hostile or benevolent.\n\nTo facilitate this discussion, it is essential to understand the concepts of internal and external forces. An internal force refers to influences stemming from within the Buddhist community, regardless of the individual's monastic status, whereas an external force originates from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any influence that damages or seeks to damage the Buddhist community, often driven by a negative perception of Buddhism. In contrast, a benign force does not intend to harm or help the community but may inadvertently cause either outcome. These terms will be used throughout this analysis.\n\nTo begin, it is crucial to explore the fundamental principles of Theravada Buddhism. Adherents seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, encompassing the Tripitaka, consists of three baskets of Buddhist scriptures: the Sutta Pitaka, containing the teachings; the Vinaya Pitaka, outlining disciplinary rules; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, delving into metaphysical concepts. These concepts include the notions of Anatta (no permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these principles is essential to escaping Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, and ultimately overcoming the afflictions of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), which are characteristic of a state of enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth guidelines for Buddhist adherents, with laypeople adhering to five precepts and monks following a more extensive set of disciplinary rules. The four noble truths are the fundamental teachings of Buddhism: the acknowledgment of Dukkha (suffering is inherent in life), the causal relationship between attachment and suffering, and the possibility of overcoming suffering.",
            "The United States and Mexico provide a notable example of two nations that were embroiled in a prolonged rivalry spanning 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. This rivalry peaked during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, in which the United States defeated Mexico and secured control over Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Over the course of their relationship, the two nations experienced numerous conflicts, which gradually subsided before the onset of World War I. The initial tensions arose from fundamental differences in their values, cultural practices, and traditions, as well as conflicting material interests. \n\nSimilarities can be drawn with other countries that share a border, as these nations often experience clashes of interests, leading to the development of rival positions. The United States and Mexico's relationship is not unique in this regard, with David M. Pletcher commenting that \"only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-standing American diplomatic challenges\" (Pletcher, 1977, p. 41). Their geographical proximity to the United States, in addition to historical rivalries, contributed to their tumultuous relationship. In contrast, many other Latin American nations have maintained positive relations with the United States.\n\nThe discord between the two nations was also fueled by differences in their religious beliefs, which have been a source of conflict in many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm noted that Americans' opposition to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries was a significant factor in their relationship with Mexico (Frahm, 2001, p. 86). This ideological divide mirrored the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, which was characterized by a mix of ideological and interest-driven competition. However, the United States and Mexico's rivalry was rooted in their differing religious preferences, rather than their political systems. The animosity between the two nations was, in part, inherited from the distrust between their former colonial rulers, the English and Spanish, which hindered the establishment of amicable diplomatic relations.\n\nAccording to Diehl and Goerts (2000), 17 disputes arose between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry period. Most of these disputes involved territorial issues, such as Mexican raids into U.S. territory and border problems. The presence of bandits and outlaws from American border towns posed a significant challenge, which was eventually addressed through joint military action by both nations (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97). \n\nSchmitt (1974) explained that the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became increasingly reliant on the United States and, eventually, as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico, marking the end of the rivalry in the late 19th century.",
            "It has been fifteen years since I was unexpectedly disabled by an illness that I was unaware of. At the time, I was a nurse, a profession I chose to pursue in response to the uncertainty and insecurity I experienced during my childhood. The notion that one could always find work because people would inevitably fall ill was a mantra that resonated with me. Although my true aspirations lay in becoming a scientist or journalist, I opted for nursing as a more stable career path.\n\nHowever, I found myself at a crossroads at the age of 46, with no savings and no ability to work. Fifteen years of living on Social Security Disability have left me with nothing to call my own. Each day is a struggle, and I face challenges to my sense of security, safety, and self-esteem. One thing that I am certain of is that without the support of my family and a few close friends, I would not have been able to survive these years, regardless of my strength. In reality, when adversity strikes, one's sense of strength is often greatly diminished.\n\nMy point is that life is inherently unpredictable, and emergencies – big or small – will inevitably arise. No amount of preparation can guarantee a smooth ride, and some challenges are too overwhelming to face alone.\n\nWhile I agree that Americans should not rely too heavily on big government, I believe that fostering a culture of mutual trust and assistance would be a more desirable approach. Rather than relying solely on individual efforts to prepare for disasters, I advocate for Americans to learn from one another, to offer help when needed, and to ask for help without hesitation. This approach is reminiscent of the values that truly sustained our ancestors during difficult times – compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources.\n\nThe idea of rugged individualism, touted by some Conservatives as a driving force behind the country's success, is a myth. In reality, it was our forefathers' ability to come together, show compassion, and share resources that helped them overcome hardships. The pioneers who traversed the Rockies in wagon trains did not achieve their goal in isolation; it was through collective effort and support.\n\nI, too, believe in being prepared for emergencies. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, and other essential items to ensure my safety in case of a crisis. If possible, having a small farm with a wood stove and the ability to preserve food can be a great asset. However, this is not a substitute for building a support network of neighbors who can offer aid when needed. Therefore, it is essential to get to know those around you and build relationships that can provide a sense of security and community in times of need.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in a particular manner remains a topic of interest, and it is unclear if there are any restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change.  Even in the early 20th century, D'Arcy Thompson noted that biologists were still struggling to mathematically describe even the simplest organic forms.  However, more recently, researchers have applied mathematical modeling to the development and evolution of mollusk skeletons, covering both their development from birth (ontogeny) and their evolutionary history (phylogeny). Our study aims to investigate how combining mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum with experimental studies can help reveal the underlying mechanisms driving the direction and magnitude of evolutionary developmental changes. By analyzing X-radiographic images of Prunum species, we identified quantitative parameters that can be used to model both hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were fed into the software program CerioShell to simulate various shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. We are integrating these findings with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a better understanding of major evolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a tube that travels through space over time, making 360-degree turns as it grows. These turns, known as whorls, are thought to spiral around an imaginary central axis called the columella, which runs through the shell's central column. The rate at which the whorls expand can vary, and a continuous line separating each whorl is referred to as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl (the body whorl) is the last one formed. The spire consists of all the whorls except the last one. The apex is the tip of the spire, while the opposite end is the base. The animal exits its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various angles, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The typical orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count the whorls, the shell should first be viewed from the apical perspective, and then the first suture should be identified. A line can be drawn to divide the shell into two parts, and whorls are counted from this line, estimating them to a quarter of a whorl if necessary.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of openings that move through time and space as the animal grows and builds its shell. It is possible to track the path of the aperture by measuring the coordinates of the center of each whorl's opening, as well as its horizontal and vertical radius. This trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. By developing a mathematical formulation, it becomes possible to modify parameters and alter the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Despite a decade of relative stagnation in neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia, the country still has a long way to go to meet its Millennium Development Goals, particularly in child and maternal health.  Although progress has been made in several areas, such as water and sanitation, the country's health system struggles to make significant improvements in these areas.  This points to a need to strengthen the overall health system rather than focusing solely on targeted programs.\n\nIndonesia has made some progress in increasing the number of skilled healthcare workers attending births, with 72% of births now meeting this standard.  However, this statistic includes traditional birth attendants who may not have the necessary medical training to handle complications, contributing to a high number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage.  Thus, these improvements may be misleading, and more work is needed.  Additionally, the percentage of children under five treated by a healthcare professional for diarrheal illnesses has decreased, and data on postnatal care is incomplete, revealing concerns in these areas. \n\nThe low cesarean-section rate of 4% indicates a lack of access to specialized medical care, with a significant disparity between urban and rural areas.  In urban settings, the c-section rate is 7%, while it is only 2% in rural areas, highlighting the disparity in access to healthcare services.  Furthermore, a 27% gap in service utilization exists between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the poor face significant barriers in accessing healthcare due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering ways to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the key question is how to effectively address the shortage of healthcare services.  The main issue is whether Indonesia should focus on developing targeted programs or strengthening its overall health system, rather than solely addressing pre and post-pregnancy care.  While program-specific approaches may yield faster results and have more manageable objectives, they also have drawbacks.  Investing heavily in one area of the health sector can divert resources and personnel away from other areas, leading to duplication of services and inefficiencies.  This can result in unnecessary administrative burdens and waste of resources.",
            "Victorian novels are characterized by their meticulous attention to detail and focus on the aristocracy of the time period. However, novels such as Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights diverge from this tradition. These two works incorporate an element of mystery and a distinct flair for the unusual, characteristics not typically found in novels of the era. This emphasis on the unknown strengthens the characters within the narrative, offering a deeper understanding of their motivations and emotions.\n\nIn the midst of turmoil, a character's mind becomes flooded with a multitude of confusing ideas and images. As seen in the passage from Dickens, a character's perception of reality becomes distorted, with fragmented scenes unfolding before their eyes. This disorienting experience is characterized by the blending of reality and fantasy, leaving the character with an intense sense of unease and discomfort.\n\nIn Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, the authors frequently employ dream sequences or dream-like states to convey the inner workings of the characters' minds. These surreal episodes often reveal the characters' deepest fears, insecurities, and desires. For instance, Oliver Twist's hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit serve as a manifestation of his inner turmoil and desperation. When Oliver relives the shooting scene in chapter 28, he is overwhelmed by a sense of helplessness and despair, highlighting his lack of control over the events unfolding around him. This portrayal underscores the theme of Oliver's powerlessness, as he is unable to influence the outcome of events, even when his life is at stake.\n\nFurthermore, the recurring theme of defeat and hopelessness is a significant aspect of Oliver's character development. His inability to take control of his circumstances, despite being faced with dire consequences, suggests that he has become resigned to his fate, allowing Fagin's influence to shape his actions and reactions.\n\nIn the same vein, the passage from Dickens continues to convey the theme of despair and hopelessness. The protagonist's perception of time becomes distorted, with days passing by in an instant, while the nights seem interminably long and filled with a sense of foreboding. The contrast between the fleeting nature of time and the eternal duration of the protagonist's suffering serves to heighten the sense of hopelessness and desperation.",
            "About two years ago, I was working in an after-school program where I tutored elementary school students in various subjects. I focused on helping them with their struggles in English and reading, as these were my areas of expertise. However, I was approached by one of the instructors to work with a third or fourth-grader named Adrian, who was facing significant difficulties with reading. As I worked with him, I realized that something was amiss; he had a peculiar reading problem, where he could effortlessly pronounce some letters, but struggled with others. This was quite unusual, especially considering that Adrian's mother spoke only Spanish, yet he spoke flawless English. It wasn't until I met his mother that the issue became clear: Adrian could read, but he had a weak understanding of the English alphabet. Although I'm not sure if this realization significantly impacted his reading abilities, I hope he has made progress since then.\n\nI share this anecdote to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, particularly in California. My story also serves to illustrate that this problem may not always be as apparent as we assume, even for students who speak perfect English, reading can still be a significant challenge. The situation with Adrian's mother made me realize that the solution to this issue is not as straightforward as it seems. While a simple approach like tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation, might work for some, it is not a universal solution for students whose first language is not English.\n\nIn my opinion, the key to addressing this complex issue lies in combining multiple strategies. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes, among others, are not mutually exclusive and can be used in conjunction with one another. In fact, combining these approaches can lead to better outcomes.\n\nThe dual language system, for instance, has been shown to be highly effective, not only for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Research indicates that students in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Despite the common misconception that this approach is a waste of resources, studies have shown that it benefits the majority of students, not just a select few. If we were to adopt this approach as a standard rather than an exception, all students would reap the benefits. However, implementing this system would require some adjustments, such as providing bilingual support staff, rather than expecting all teachers to be fluent in multiple languages. This would not only be impractical but also unrealistic. Nevertheless, I believe that having bilingual support staff or tutors can make a significant difference in helping students overcome language barriers.",
            "As children, many of us are taught that there exists something beyond our comprehension, something greater than ourselves.  This concept can be learned in various settings, such as Sunday school or through personal reflection.  While some people adhere to the faith passed down to them by their families, others refuse to accept any notion of a higher power, instead embracing a self-centered worldview.  It is common for individuals to adopt one set of values, only to later change and adopt another.  Our pursuit of spirituality serves as a means to understand ourselves and our place in the world.  We seek guidance, a beacon of hope, to lead us out of darkness and into the light.\n\nIn a moment of quiet contemplation on our front porch, my father shared with me his favorite type of bird, the cardinal, while the sound of rain pounded against the tin roof above us.  His frail appearance, brought on by recent health struggles, was a stark contrast to his former robust self.  As he gazed out into the rain, I felt a deep sense of unease and a longing to talk to him about my impending loss, but I knew that acknowledging it would only make the reality more painful for both of us.  I found solace in our shared silence, and I drew closer to him, sitting beside him as we both looked out into the rain.\n\nMy father's passing occurred five days after my twenty-second birthday in December.  Despite the medical treatments that prolonged his life beyond the expected period, his suffering persisted.  I found myself questioning a higher power, wondering if it existed at all and, if so, whether it had abandoned me.  In the stillness of night, I chose not to pray, as I felt that any divine being had long since stopped listening to my pleas.\n\nI had not wanted to witness his transition from life to death, so I chose not to be there.  I couldn't bear to see the person who had given me life slipping away.  Instead, I chose to remember him through his life, not his passing.  I knew him better than anyone, and I believed that he would not have wanted me to be present at his death.  I spent three days in solitude, waiting for news of his passing.  Unfortunately, I was not even contacted during that time.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is itself an oxymoron, as described by Ian Watt in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, combining the concepts of \"old\" and \"new.\" The Gothic genre has been subject to diverse opinions, ranging from criticism for lacking depth to praise for evoking a sense of the \"terrible sublime.\" The pioneering work, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, drew upon both ancient and modern romance elements to establish the proto-Gothic genre and create a new style of literary expression. By blending old theatrical elements with the modern novel's format, Walpole presented \"A Gothic Story\" that appealed to a unique blend of past and present.\n\nThe Gothic genre heavily draws from medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions, which were already perceived as archaic and unsophisticated in comparison to modern societal and literary advancements at the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication. However, it was the combination of the dramatic, theatrical aspects of the Gothic with the novel's ability to offer a personal insight into character psychology that allowed the genre to endure and become both timeless and innovative to readers separated from the original writing by time.\n\nOne of the key features of Gothic literature is the romanticization of the concept of Chivalry. In The Castle of Otranto, the medieval idea of chivalry, which involves the training of a noble knight, is both preserved and transformed. This theme holds significant importance in Gothic literature because it represents the idealized image of a brave, honorable, and capable knight, and the perceived lack of such qualities in the authors' contemporary society. By employing chivalric concepts and ideals, the Gothic past is idealized and romanticized, foreshadowing the evolution of Gothic into Romantic literature. \n\nThe author, Horace Walpole, wrote The Castle of Otranto during a time of social turmoil, and his writing reflects his concerns about the apparent decline of moral values and innate goodness in society. This is evident in the character of Frederic, a prince who embodies many chivalric traits. The description of Frederic as a prince who has suffered, been affected by tragedy, and is said to have been killed by infidels, exemplifies the exaggerated image of the gallant and courteous knight that is characteristic of the Gothic genre.",
            "Supply chain management is the intricate network of processes involved in moving goods from the initial customer order to the final delivery of products to customers. The concept of supply chain management was first introduced by Keith Oliver in 1982, a renowned consultant who outlined the essential components of effective supply chain management, encompassing planning, implementation, and control to meet customer needs efficiently. The core elements of a supply chain include production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information, which business managers utilize to deliver exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction is the foundation of the supply chain process, requiring careful planning of 'when', 'why', 'where', and 'how' products will be manufactured. To achieve this, managers need to understand customer requirements, which can be determined by analyzing market trends. This analysis enables managers to decide on the products to be produced, their quantities, production locations, and optimal production volume to meet customer demands. Scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment are critical tasks to be addressed during this stage, as every detail plays a vital role in the overall efficiency of the process. A well-planned production process, like the ones adopted by companies such as Wal-Mart and Target, ensures a smooth operation, minimizing confusion and miscommunication.\n\nSupply is another crucial element in supply chain management, involving strategic decisions that define a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. This may involve allocating different production divisions to specific tasks, leveraging their unique equipment, workers, and specialties. Alternatively, management may opt to outsource certain processes to other companies to achieve velocity, which means providing quality products while maintaining low costs by enhancing flexibility and efficiency.",
            "The sign on the street corner, held up by Ellen Page, reads, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" The juxtaposition of this message with the image of the actress, who starred in the film Juno, is striking. Burma, now known as Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia that has been ruled by a repressive military regime since a coup in 1962. In 2007, a wave of protests swept the country, known as the \"Saffron Revolution,\" which was led by Buddhist monks who wore saffron-colored robes. The protests, which began peacefully, soon turned violent as the government cracked down on the monks and their supporters. Journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai, were arrested and killed while covering the protests. Estimates of the death toll vary, but one colonel who defected from the military claimed that the true number of deaths was in the thousands. \n\nThis is not an isolated incident. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain control over their citizens. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine authority, while Japanese emperors were believed to be gods. Even in modern times, leaders have used various means to silence opposition, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, and the atrocities committed during Hitler's \"Third Reich.\" These examples highlight the enduring pattern of governments using force to maintain power and silence dissent.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on jazz is largely due to his remarkable career longevity and his ability to showcase his orchestra's individual talents through his creative genius. Although his piano presence is often understated in many compositions, Ellington excelled as a composer, crafting intricate and complex pieces that highlighted the unique abilities of each band member. As a master composer, he skillfully created frameworks that allowed soloists to improvise freely while writing tightly orchestrated pieces that emphasized the distinctive styles of individual members. This approach not only showcased the orchestra's cohesive sound but also enabled Ellington to produce some of the most groundbreaking pieces in the history of jazz.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative use of voice as a musical instrument throughout his career, exemplified by Creole Love Call, an early piece that incorporated vocals to add texture and depth without lyrics. This 12-bar blues piece demonstrates Ellington's ability to complement the styles of his soloists, a trait evident throughout his work. The composition features six distinct choruses, each showcasing a unique aspect of the band's sound:\n\nThe first chorus features a call-and-response dialogue between voice and reeds, with the voice transitioning from smooth to rough. The second chorus features a muted trumpet solo elaborating on the melody and emphasizing extended blue notes. The third chorus features a sweeping clarinet solo in a high register accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase. The fourth chorus is a full-band rendition of the first chorus, with a call-and-response between brass and reed sections. The fifth chorus is the climactic point of the piece, with reeds taking the lead and syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections. The final chorus returns to the first chorus's structure, with the voice adopting a growl technique and soloing as an instrument. The piece concludes with a brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice as a tone-color instrument is a recurring theme throughout his work, as seen in pieces like Creole Love Call. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his orchestration skills with his sensitivity to tone color, using a call-and-response phrase between Bubber Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing to create a rich and complementary sound. In It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington leverages Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's talents as a trombonist to great effect, introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "She had long harbored an unfulfilled longing, a sense of emptiness that persisted since her early teenage years. By the time she turned 17, she had become convinced that the solution lay in finding a romantic partner, yet she found herself uninterested in the boys who had shown interest in her. Her introspection had led to various theories, but none had seemed satisfactory. Her life was a continuous cycle of questioning her desires.\n\nOrdinarily, her home was a peaceful haven, with her parents maintaining a calm atmosphere, and disagreements with her being a rare occurrence. Her parents valued her independence and lively personality, which complemented their own tranquil nature. However, today was an exception. As she searched for inspiration, she was startled by her mother's anguished cry from the kitchen. She rushed in to find her mother lying on the ground, in obvious pain, and repeatedly saying \"Ow.\" With growing panic, her daughter rushed to her side and offered assistance. \"Ouch... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother gasped. The daughter quickly assessed the situation and helped her mother get into the car.\n\nUpon arriving at the hospital, the daughter was surrounded by the harsh smells of disinfectant and illness mixed with an air of concern. But her focus remained on her mother's well-being. She quickly helped her mother onto a rolling bed and called for medical assistance. The doctors and nurses rushed to her side, and her daughter was left to anxiously wait. \n\nIt turned out that her mother had slipped off a step stool while trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to identify a connection between adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, reflected by a high alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score, and a reduced risk of heart disease and stroke, as well as stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet, an adaptation of the traditional Mediterranean diet, emphasizes the consumption of plant-based foods, including fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, and plant-based proteins (excluding potatoes), along with higher intakes of monounsaturated fats and fish, while limiting animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is also permitted.\n\nPrevious studies had found an inverse link between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and total and cardiovascular mortality. Furthermore, a clinical trial demonstrated that the Mediterranean diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving the cholesterol ratio in obese individuals. However, prior research did not specifically examine the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis observational study tracked 74,886 middle-aged women without a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, who were participants in a larger cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. An aMed diet score was computed from self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) six times between 1984 and 2004, assessing nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of nurses maintained their participation throughout the 20-year study period. The accuracy of FFQs was validated, and reports of heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke were confirmed through medical records, hospital records, or death certificates. Cases where records were unavailable were classified as \"probable\" and included in the analysis, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal heart attacks falling into this category. Additional factors, including body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone replacement therapy, were also calculated for each FFQ. Starting in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo account for individual variations and better represent long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two prior years). Potential confounding factors were adjusted for, including age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe study employed Cox proportional-hazard modeling to investigate the association between the aMed score and the risk of heart disease and stroke, using separate models for fatal and non-fatal heart disease and stroke types.\n\nThe findings showed that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal heart disease and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk of both heart disease and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk, 0.71).",
            "The United States faced a severe financial crisis in 2007, marked by soaring unemployment, a collapsed housing market, and numerous prominent corporations on the brink of collapse. This ongoing economic downturn has prompted the question: what led to this crisis, and how can we prevent it? In essence, the financial crisis was triggered by shortsighted and reckless policy decisions that forced banks and companies to issue high-risk sub-prime loans to an underdeveloped financial system. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, tasked with underwriting and repackaging these mortgages into complex financial instruments, further exacerbated the problem. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks struggled to maintain their capital reserves, leading to a chain reaction that spread financial chaos throughout the economy.\n\nThe roots of the crisis date back to 1999, when the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions in a bid to boost the President's popularity. This decision laid the groundwork for the sub-prime crisis that unfolded seven years later. In 1999, New York Times journalist Steven Holmes sounded a warning about the potential consequences of this policy: Fannie Mae, the largest mortgage underwriter in the country, faced pressure from the government to expand its lending to low- and moderate-income households, and from shareholders to maintain its profit margins. Holmes foresaw the possibility of a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\n\nA combination of factors contributed to the economic turmoil, including the proliferation of complex mortgage products such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These instruments deeply entangled various sectors of the economy with the housing market, leaving households and financial institutions heavily exposed to even minor fluctuations in housing prices. As a result, the housing market bubble burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities reeling. In 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, equivalent to approximately 30% of the country's GDP. The crisis ultimately led to the sale of Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch at fire-sale prices, the dismantling of Lehman Brothers, and the forced transformation of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley into commercial banks subject to strict regulation. Fannie and Freddie, burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "The infamous exposition - a part of storytelling where writers often struggle to strike the right balance between drawing readers in and overwhelming them with unnecessary details.  It's the moment when you spread your creative wings, only to risk sending your audience to sleep or reaching for the \"Back\" button.  Even the most seasoned writers like Dr. Merlin have been known to get frustrated when faced with Too Much Information, much to the dismay of their monitors.\n\nExposition is a nemesis for many writers, reminding them to include background information to progress the plot, but it can easily become a hindrance if not done correctly.  This is where the age-old 'show, don't tell' rule comes into play, yet even experienced writers like Dr. Merlin often find themselves slipping into lengthy passages that fail to engage.\n\nIn essence, exposition is about providing the reader with essential details through straightforward narration.  It's similar to a character dumping a wealth of information on another character in a film, as seen in 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner'.  When authors do it in literature, it can be a problem, especially when used to convey the history of a character or event.\n\nA prime example of this can be seen in literature.  You're reading a story and learn about the heroine meeting her beloved at a specific time and place, their wedding being grand, and her husband's tragic demise.  If the author spent two pages detailing this sequence, with the couple only exchanging two lines of dialogue, it would likely be unengaging.  Instead, the author should delve deeper into the husband's character, showcasing his love through his words and actions, allowing the reader to experience his presence in the heroine's life.  This in turn would make the reader more emotionally invested in the story and better understand the heroine's character.\n\nIn short, the reader needs meat to complement the story's bare bones - 'They met, they married, he died.'  As a writer, it's crucial to provide this depth, even when it's tempting to rush through certain aspects of the narrative.  This is especially true when introducing new characters, such as a former Air Force member who's now running a gas station, with a complex past and secretly ambitious dreams.  It's essential to avoid overwhelming the reader with too much information and instead, present it in a way that adds to the story, rather than detracting from it.",
            "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, on August 13, 2011. The first one was a live NBC 4 newscast. The lead story centered around a man in Ashley, Ohio, named Shad Hostettler, who had stabbed his wife multiple times. Although the wife's name was not disclosed, police had already arrested Hostettler. The news team allocated approximately two minutes to this story, which seemed reasonable given the developing nature of the case.\n\nThe subsequent story reported on an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers, who had been critically injured in a shooting in the Sharon Woods area. At the time, no arrests had been made, and the SWAT Team was conducting an investigation. This story appeared to be brief, which may have been due to the fact that the victim was a member of a minority group. It is a common observation that such incidents involving minorities may receive less media attention. \n\nThe following story involved a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, which was likely caused by a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. A $5000 reward was being offered to anyone who could provide information leading to the arrest of the perpetrator.\n\nThe weather forecast for the weekend predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures ranging from the mid to low eighties. Although the segment was a bit short, it was presented as a teaser to encourage viewers to tune in for further updates.\n\nThe newscast also covered a robbery at a UDF in Clime Road, Columbus, where a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie had stolen from the store. He was described as being approximately six feet tall and weighing about 150 pounds. It was notable that the news team devoted a considerable amount of time to emphasizing the perpetrator's ethnicity.\n\nAnother story featured Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas-based drug kingpin. He had been found guilty of smuggling large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. One peculiar aspect of this report was the use of the phrase \"300 months\" instead of \"25 years\" to describe his prison sentence. The inclusion of Rodriguez's Hispanic ethnicity in the story might have been unnecessary.",
            "There's a profound and unbreakable connection between brothers, encompassing a complex array of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. This unique bond allows brothers to understand each other on a deep level, often seeing themselves reflected in their sibling. When faced with challenging situations, the true nature of this bond is revealed, whether it's characterized by positivity or negativity. Along with these emotions comes a sense of responsibility, as one must confront the consequences that arise from them. Gazing into a brother's eyes, one sees not only their own reflection but also their true character, which is revealed through their actions and the outcomes of those actions. This theme is explored in \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" where two brothers navigate the intense feelings associated with their bond amidst a vividly described backdrop. As they embark on a futile journey, bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in a climactic scene, and only one brother manages to survive. The novel conveys this theme through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with his brother, as well as the narrator's perspective, which conveys the complex emotions experienced by the protagonist and his perception of the world around him.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single dominant emotion: pride. From their initial outing together to their final, fateful excursion, he harbors resentment towards Doodle. The protagonist had envisioned a brother who could learn from him and share in his adventures, such as holding his breath, running, or climbing vines in Old Woman Swamp. However, Doodle's physical limitations, resulting from a weak heart, render this ideal impossible. The protagonist's dreams are crushed when he realizes that Doodle will unlikely participate in these activities. In fact, he even experiences anger towards the child, as evidenced by his thoughts of suffocating him with a pillow. However, the child's smile brings about a change in him, revealing an underlying love for his sibling. This shows that his conviction was likely not strong, and his instincts as a brother still prevailed.",
            "The human brain is a complex and imaginative information processing system that has been described using a variety of metaphors as technology progressed. Initially, it was compared to a simple wax tablet, then to a piece of papyrus, followed by a book, and most recently, to a computer. It is essential to keep in mind that these metaphors are limited in their usefulness and may lead to misconceptions. \n\nThe process of processing information in the brain begins with sensory organs converting physical stimuli, such as touch, temperature, sound waves, or light, into electrical signals. These sensory inputs are repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms through bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, the brain initially breaks down the information into basic components like color, orientation, and the borders of the object. This allows it to determine that the image represents a box. However, top-down processing builds upon these initial conclusions to speed up the recognition process by using previously made decisions. This can help identify the object as a specific box, rather than a hole in the background.\n\nOnce information has been processed to a certain point, an attention filter decides its significance and determines which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, even though the brain processes every blade of grass when looking at shoes, a healthy attention filter ensures that we don't notice individual blades. On the other hand, we might focus on our name being spoken in a noisy room. There are multiple stages of processing, and the results are repeatedly modulated by attention.\n\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. The process starts with encoding, where information is converted into a form that can be stored. Various types of encoding exist for different types of sensory inputs. For example, verbal input can be encoded based on how it looks, how it sounds, or what it means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Research on animals suggests that working memory, which stores information for around 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal that temporarily loops through a series of neurons. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained through the structure of specific types of proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models explaining how knowledge is organized in the brain, based on various approaches such as human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, which are linked based on their relatedness. For instance, in this model, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which could be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In his dystopian novel Brave New World, Aldous Huxley critiques the impending dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the capitalistic framework that sustains it. The society in the novel prioritizes communal harmony over individuality, conditioning its citizens from birth to pursue instant gratification above all else. This results in people being reduced to mere pawns in a larger game, confined to a single ideology dictated by the World Controller. Upon analyzing the novel through the lens of Marxist ideology, it becomes evident that Huxley harbors suspicions about the development of these systems. The presence of Marxist terminology such as homogeny and reification underscores the notion that Brave New World is a commentary on the shortcomings of the emerging economic systems of Huxley's time.\n\nHuxley satirizes capitalism by employing the concept of false consciousness, a Marxist thesis which suggests that the common citizenry is kept in the dark about their true relationships with other economic classes, prioritizing personal gain instead. This is achieved through the ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, which is exemplified in the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The lower classes, represented by Delta and Gamma, lack genuine autonomy, with their drive to consume and indulge strengthened through hypnopædia. This manipulation is orchestrated by the World Controller. The novel also illustrates the concept of hegemony, where a dominant group exercises control over others, in this case, the upper classes. The lower classes are oblivious to this manipulation, blindly embracing an ideology that perpetuates the existing structure. In contrast, the upper classes, such as Alphas and Betas, are aware of the manipulation but choose to accept their position, with few exceptions. The interactions between social classes in the novel serve as a testament to the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nThe novel portrays relationships between individuals as superficial, with characters lacking depth and distinction, even among major characters. Huxley may be suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism erodes human free will and self-expression. Love and extreme emotions are nonexistent, replaced by shallow interactions that focus on physical appearances and superficial connections. The societal classes' complacency with their positions in the hierarchy and their absolute obedience to their role in the community reflect the Marxist concept of the proletariat, who are led to believe they are superior as long as they conform and consume.",
            "I have been enrolled in University Park for approximately two and a half years, with four and a half semesters under my belt. For many students, including myself, navigating the campus can be a significant challenge. During my freshman year, I resided in an East Halls dorm, situated on the easternmost part of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. The commute from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in buildings like the Willard building, located near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, particularly on inclement days. I recall speaking with an alumnus, not much older than myself, who shared that the East Halls dorms used to be separated from the rest of the university by large tracts of unused land. However, this vacant space has since been transformed into sports fields, new buildings, such as the Creamery and health services facility, and surrounded by apartments. As the campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another is becoming increasingly difficult. An effective solution to this problem is the bicycle, which is especially beneficial on a college campus. Nevertheless, simply owning a bike is not enough – students need to actually ride them, and the campus infrastructure must be designed with bicyclists in mind.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who has resumed cycling after a hiatus of several years. He expressed his surprise at having stopped riding in the first place, stating, \"Bikes are great; for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the most practical way to get around.\" Bicycling offers numerous physical benefits and is also an efficient means of transportation. With a bowl of oatmeal and some physical exertion, you can cover distances of 30 miles or more. Like many of my peers, I now reside off campus, just as far from the campus center as some dorms. This semester, I made the astute decision to purchase a bike, which has greatly improved my daily routine. With classes in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my home, biking cuts down the time to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly enough. However, the most direct route to Thomas building from my home is Pollock Road, which is not always an easy road to navigate, whether on a bike or on foot. While walking has its advantages, I am too busy to walk. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily routine, resulting in over two and a half hours per week. Considering the cumulative time spent walking to and from classes, appointments, and other commitments, I would be left with little time for anything else."
