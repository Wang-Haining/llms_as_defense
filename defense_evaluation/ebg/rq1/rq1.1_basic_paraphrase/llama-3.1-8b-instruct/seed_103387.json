            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "As I pursue a degree in social work, I aim to embark on a career path within the Division of Family and Children Services, where I can make a positive impact on the lives of children who have been abused or neglected, and provide support to families in need. My commitment to this field is driven by a set of core values, including a strong sense of service, respect for others, a commitment to upholding ethical standards, and a dedication to fostering healthy relationships between individuals. These values not only resonate with me professionally but also hold personal significance.\n\nMy desire to help others has been a long-standing aspect of my personality, although I initially struggled to identify a career path that aligned with this passion. Throughout my high school and college years, I observed individuals frequently avoiding their problems and adopting unconventional coping mechanisms. These experiences prompted me to choose a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, which, however, did not initially clarify my career direction. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break before encountering a pivotal experience that shifted my perspective. I met a 16-year-old boy who was fleeing his abusive home and had called the police for assistance. Upon learning of the situation, I visited the boy's parents' residence, where I expressed my concerns to the police and offered to talk to the parents. My conversation with them raised red flags, as they seemed evasive and made excuses for the boy's behavior. This encounter instilled in me a strong desire to pursue a career in social work, which I believe will enable me to make a difference in the lives of children and families facing similar challenges.\n\nAnother essential value in the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we often claim to value individuality, yet we often conform to traditional norms. I, on the other hand, believe in embracing my uniqueness and not limiting myself to societal expectations. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively spoke out against social injustices, whether through self-expression (e.g., unconventional hairstyles, piercings), my involvement with the Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance, or advocating against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it. My commitment to social justice remains unwavering, and I intend to continue fighting for equality and human rights.",
            "This paper delves into the dual perspectives of biological and sociocultural models in understanding the complex nature of insomnia, a sleep disorder that affects individuals worldwide. The biological model centers on the genetic and medical aspects of sleep, encompassing heritable factors and physiological processes. Conversely, the sociocultural model examines the environmental factors, including demographics, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity, which play a significant role in shaping sleep patterns. This comprehensive review aims to explore these models by analyzing relevant research and critiquing its strengths and limitations.\n\nInsomnia can be classified into three primary categories: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to mental health conditions, and sleep disorders caused by medical complications or substance intake. Primary sleep disorders, such as Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, are characterized by difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep or experiencing behavioral and physiological abnormalities during sleep. Dyssomnias, which include conditions like insomnia and hypersomnia, are marked by difficulties in falling asleep or staying awake, respectively. In contrast, Parasomnias, including nightmare disorder and sleepwalking disorder, are associated with behavioral and physiological irregularities during sleep. Other mental health-related sleep disorders involve sleep disturbances stemming from Axis I or Axis II disorders.\n\nFocusing on the biological model, research has identified neurons in the hypothalamus, specifically those containing orexin, as crucial for regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice revealed the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons, which are responsible for sleep-wake states. The activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while inhibition leads to reduced anxiety and improved sleep quality. The use of a GABAB agonist, baclofen, was found to increase sleep duration, implying a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. This study's findings have significant implications, suggesting that a problem or absence of this receptor could impair an individual's ability to sleep without medication, negatively impacting daily life and productivity, including tasks that require focus and concentration.",
            "This paper delves into three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Firstly, it offers a concise definition of the condition. Secondly, it explains the diagnostic process, highlighting common characteristics or warning signs. Lastly, it discusses ways in which a teacher in a mainstream classroom can support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to the brain's ability to effectively utilize auditory information. In essence, it is a condition where the central nervous system struggles to process sounds, despite the ability to hear normally. Unlike hearing impairments, individuals with CAPD are not deaf, but their brains have difficulty interpreting and distinguishing between sounds, separating words from background noise, and differentiating between various conversations.\n\nThe earliest recorded mention of CAPD dates back to the 1950s, when researchers identified \"auditory imperception\" as a relevant area of study in children with communication disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari developed tests for these children in 1954, and in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the physiological workings of the brain during dichotic perception. A national conference in 1977 sparked further research into CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways, including difficulties in localizing sounds, distinguishing between multiple sounds, recognizing sound patterns, and detecting changes in speech, such as sarcasm. Additionally, individuals with CAPD may struggle to focus on specific sounds amidst background noise, synthesize sound clues, and determine the sequence of auditory information. \n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a comprehensive evaluation is conducted using systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests. This can be carried out by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals using a range of measures that assess auditory-related skills. The evaluation may include questionnaires, surveys, and observation of auditory behaviors in response to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single, consistently effective diagnostic tool, and the underlying cause of CAPD remains unknown. Diagnostic tests often present multiple auditory stimuli simultaneously and ask the individual to identify specific items, such as words or numbers. More advanced assessments involve recording and measuring the brain's response to acoustic signals within the ear.",
            "The play Twelfth Night appears to convey that while disguises can be used to deceive others for an extended period, ultimately, a person must discard their disguise to avoid losing themselves in the process. However, abandoning deception can lead to feelings of isolation, as one may be disconnected from those around them. As a result, individuals must weigh their own self-preservation against the preservation of their relationships. Although reactions to being deceived can vary, some may react neutrally, while others will be offended by the deception. This is particularly problematic when it involves gender role reversal, as it raises questions about the underlying motivations for adopting a disguise. \n\nIn the case of Viola, her decision to disguise herself as a man is driven by self-protection, as reflected in her words: \"I'll take you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). Initially, her plan is successful in protecting her, but it also creates a distance between her and the women around her, leaving her without a support system. Furthermore, her disguise is so convincing that it leads to confusion, as Olivia mistakenly falls in love with her. Viola also has to navigate her unrequited love for Orsino, as well as suppressed romantic desires: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love a woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nFrom a modern perspective, Twelfth Night may be seen as an example of how deception can facilitate the exposure of repressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that these characters may have unconscious desires that are forced to the surface by Viola's disguise. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because of his appearance as a man, or does she genuinely harbor feelings for women? Although it is likely that Olivia is not attracted to women, her character may be satirizing the tendency of people to judge others based on appearance. This is evident in her swift transition from loving Cesario to regarding him as a family member: \"A sister, you are she\" (5.1.315).",
            "German colonial rule was characterized by varying degrees of brutality, particularly in relation to the atrocities committed against the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. The diversity of the German colonial empire, encompassing different policies, ruling styles, and geographical areas, complicates a simplistic analysis. Educational systems across the colonies also showed significant variations. When the British took over German East Africa (now Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large, educated, and literate African population, a result of German educational efforts. Conversely, German educational initiatives in Kamerun and other colonies received praise from contemporary writers. \n\nHowever, German South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast. Unlike in East Africa, where the government invested in state schools and played a significant role in native education, in South West Africa the responsibility was largely left to missionary societies with limited government support. Yet, the government invested substantial resources in educating Europeans in the colony, establishing a system of state schools and heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. This disparity in educational policies would have lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. In stark contrast to other German colonies, where a significant number of Africans were literate and educated, 'the overwhelming majority of the population in South West Africa remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.' Various factors contributed to this divergent experience, including social, political, and economic considerations.\n\nThis paper aims to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and focusing on recent research into the views of settlers and colonial authorities on native Africans. A substantial body of literature exists on education within the German colonial empire, primarily in German and written in the early 20th century. Early works mainly focused on describing the educational systems in these colonies, while later English-language writings expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education across the various German colonies and more in-depth analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant differences in educational systems across the various colonies. Cohen's study, which compared the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa and highlighted the factors contributing to the differences between them, is a prominent example of this work. According to Cohen, the significant settler population in South West Africa is a major factor in the distinguishing characteristics of the colony's educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, despite being largely covered by arid desert. This favorable climate contributed to a relatively large European population in South West Africa. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, significantly more than the approximately 5,336 settlers in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population.",
            "Over the past 100 years, the classification of popular music has become increasingly complex due to the numerous genres that have emerged. Many of these genres, such as rock, country, jazz, and folk, have branched out into multiple sub-genres, making it challenging to create a definitive list. One genre that has exploded with diversity is heavy metal rock, which has become one of the most expressive and dynamic genres in popular music over the past 40 years. Characterized by its ability to convey a wide range of emotions, heavy metal tends to focus on the darker side of the emotional spectrum. This genre's versatility has led to the creation of numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, resulting in a vast array of styles within the heavy metal movement.\n\nToday, the heavy metal genre has become so diverse and niche-specific that it can be difficult to pinpoint its exact definition. The genre has incorporated elements from other genres while still maintaining its unique identity. To understand the vast array of metal music that exists today, it is essential to grasp the origins and evolution of the heavy metal movement.\n\nAt its core, the heavy metal movement is defined by its association with darkness, which is reflected in its music, often characterized by its greater emphasis on bass, volume, and theatricality. Heavy metal music is also marked by its technical complexity, with musicians showcasing their exceptional skill and musicianship. Additionally, the genre has a history of being linked to the use of psychedelic drugs, particularly during the 1970s, which influenced the creation of some of its most iconic and experimental records. The genre's dark, visceral qualities were a departure from the more lighthearted and mainstream music that dominated the music scene at the time. Later generations of metal musicians drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's emphasis on the darker aspects of human emotion. Examples of lyrics, such as those found in Helter Skelter by the Beatles, demonstrate the genre's affinity for exploring the darker side of human experience. This song, often cited as one of the first heavy metal songs, was a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier and darker style, showcasing the Beatles' ability to create music that was equally intense and heavy.",
            "Well before the Surrealist movement took shape, Henri Rousseau was working tirelessly to bring his dreams to life, both literally and figuratively. His 1910 painting, The Dream, captures not only the wonder of a woman as she explores a mystical land within her dreams but also Rousseau's own aspirations as an artist. Throughout his career, he longed for recognition, acclaim, and admiration from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, but this aspiration came with an inner conflict. Rousseau had to decide whether to conform to established artistic styles to gain acceptance from the art world he admired or maintain his creative independence and forge his own path.\n\nTo fully understand the significance of The Dream, one must first delve into Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the French town of Laval, he was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle. Despite having no formal art training, Rousseau worked as a municipal toll service employee until the age of 40, earning the nickname 'douanier,' or customs inspector. His life took a significant turn after the death of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children, leaving him with a daughter, Julia, and immense sadness. To find solace and a fresh start, Rousseau turned to painting. Unlike his contemporaries who often romanticized and idealized peasants in their work, Rousseau's paintings reflected his humble background and the hopes and fears of the average person from his social class.\n\nRousseau's desire for acceptance by the art world is understandable given his circumstances. He began his artistic career at an older age, with no formal education in painting, and was producing works alongside many other talented and well-known modern artists. It wasn't until around the same time that Matisse started gaining recognition as an artist that Rousseau received proper recognition for his art. According to author Jan Gordon in his book Modern French Painters, Rousseau and Matisse were distinct not only in their style and subject matter but also in their motivations for creating art. While Matisse sought to avoid painting in a predictable way, Rousseau aimed to create conventional works that would earn him acceptance by the Artiste Français.",
            "The idea that ethics and aesthetics are interconnected has been a concept explored by many influential thinkers. I agree that there's a fundamental basis for this connection. John Keats' famous quote from \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know,\" highlights the notion that truth and beauty are deeply intertwined. While our understanding of the world is often acquired through education and experience, we don't learn to appreciate ethics and aesthetics in the same way. Both ethics and aesthetics are descriptive, rather than prescriptive, and our studies of morality and beauty aim to explain why something is beautiful or moral, rather than provide a set of rules for creating or assessing it.\n\nIn fact, it's challenging to fully capture the essence of what makes something good or beautiful through criticism. Discussions about the value of a work of art, like the Mona Lisa, may focus on technical aspects such as composition, contrast, or cultural context, but these elements don't fully convey why it's considered a masterpiece. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often respond with phrases like \"There's just something about it,\" which hints at a deeper, more complex understanding. Both art and morals seem to possess an intangible quality that cannot be reduced to a detailed description. This is echoed in the words of Flannery O'Connor, who said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, ethics has this same transcendent quality, as Ludwig Wittgenstein noted, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\"\n\nThis transcendent nature of both ethics and aesthetics serves as a common thread between them. Furthermore, both morality and art have a profound impact on us at a level that cannot be fully explained, a phenomenon described as \"noumenal\" in philosophical terms. This connection is particularly strong when it comes to literature, as it uniquely combines art and moral quality. As pointed out by McKean, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about it, is its moral quality.\" Literature, like life itself, inherently involves values, making it a vital source of moral guidance and inspiration.",
            "Germany is a unified nation with its unique cultural identity spanning from the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea in Kiel, and from the Rhine River in Cologne to the Elbe River in Dresden. This diverse culture is shaped by its complex history, which is influenced by various tribes and sources. The origin of the name \"Germany\" is a topic of ongoing debate among scholars and historians.\n\nSome believe that the name \"Germany\" originated from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, as suggested by the Roman historian Tacitus. According to Tacitus, the Romans adopted the term \"Germanus\" from the Gauls, using it to distinguish between the Gauls they had conquered and the Germanic tribes they had not. However, the Gauls themselves may have derived the term from a local word, possibly referring to a neighbor or a geographical location. Julius Caesar used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, describing the Germans as a formidable force that frequently clashed with the Gauls.\n\nAnother theory suggests that the name \"Germany\" is derived from the word \"ger,\" an Old English term for spear, or from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout\" or \"loud,\" implying that the Germans were a vocal and assertive people. The Roman historian Tacitus wrote in his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" that the Germans were an indigenous people, untainted by immigration or cultural exchange with other civilizations. However, the Romans did have contact with the Germanic tribes, who lived on the borders of the empire and engaged in trade and military service with the Romans.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes emerged in the 1st century AD, they interacted with the Roman Empire, trading goods and skills, and serving in the Roman army. While the Romans maintained their dominance over the empire, they also acknowledged the Germanic tribes as a significant force, with Tacitus describing them as a people of strong character and distinct culture.",
            "My gaze fell downwards, and my mind was consumed by the scene in front of me, yet I couldn't process it emotionally.  I observed it with a detached mindset, unable to link the object of my gaze to any deeper understanding.  Thoughts flashed in my mind, only to quickly disappear, leaving me with a sense of disconnection from my own thoughts.  My consciousness functioned smoothly, allowing me to experience the scene unfolding before me without any personal interpretation.\n\nThe memory of an art instructor's advice led me to purchase \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" a book that aimed to teach drawing techniques.  Having been fascinated with drawing since childhood, this book provided a comprehensive guide, covering even the basics, such as understanding the properties of a pencil and the brain's processes for interpreting lines.  One of the techniques the book recommended was to place a frame around the subject to be drawn, simplifying complex scenes and allowing for a clearer understanding of the composition.  However, at that moment, I found it difficult to mentally apply this concept to the scene before me – a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen – as I was overwhelmed by its complexity.\n\nAs I stood there, lost in the beauty of the scene, I couldn't help but think of famous artists like Picasso, Monet, and the masters of the Italian Renaissance, each with their unique style and color palette.  If I wanted to create something worthy of being called art, then this was the starting point, the beginning of my artistic journey, titled \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingers instinctively reached for the pencil, my hand tensed and relaxed as I prepared to create.  However, my action was interrupted by a sudden urge, and I found myself gripping the toilet handle, my muscles tensing with each attempt to dislodge the stubborn brown mass.  The toilet refused to cooperate, and my hand slapped against the handle in frustration.  Holding a mop, wearing a green tie that felt constricting, and gazing at the unappealing waste left behind by someone else, I felt a mix of emotions.  After a few more flushes, I took a deep breath, stood up straight, and with a sense of resolve, I grasped the toilet paper and wrapped my hand around it, creating a makeshift mitten.  With a newfound determination, I leaned forward, my hand slowly entering the bowl, as if I was preparing to retrieve something precious.",
            "The alarming number of teenager fatalities on the road is largely due to a combination of factors that are uniquely tied to this age group.  According to the National Institutes of Health, one key reason stems from the fact that the teenage brain is not fully equipped to handle the dangers associated with driving.  Additionally, inexperience plays a significant role, not only in increasing the likelihood of fatal accidents but also in contributing to higher rates of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and off-road incidents.\n\nIt is also evident that teenagers are more prone to accidents when they drive with their peers, which is a common occurrence.  A study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a correlation between the age of passengers and the number of traffic accidents that occur.  Various states, including California, have attempted to mitigate this issue by introducing temporary provisional licenses, which restrict the driving hours of teens and prohibit them from transporting other minors.\n\nHowever, these measures, in my opinion, are merely temporary solutions.  The fundamental issue lies in the fact that, as a group, the youngest drivers lack the capacity to adequately manage the risks and responsibilities associated with driving.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman suggests that 18 is still too young for a regular driver's license, citing his research on the common desire among those under 19-20 to engage in thrill-seeking behavior.  Given this, it makes sense to delay driving privileges until this tendency has diminished.  If we persist in issuing driver's licenses to young teens, we can expect to see a continuous rise in fatal accidents, with potentially catastrophic consequences in the coming years.  By 2010, the Baby Boomer generation's children will be reaching driving age, and millions of new teen drivers will be hitting the roads.\n\nTo address this issue, legislation that restricts driving to those 18 and above could be implemented.  Schools could continue to provide driver's education classes to facilitate the learning process, while provisional permits could still be issued prior to a full driver's license.  The required hours of practical driver's training could be based on the existing standards in the majority of states, such as California's requirement of 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice.  Given that the statistics on teen driver fatalities are consistent across the country, a uniform national law addressing this issue would be a sensible and effective means of protecting young drivers nationwide.\n\nThis proposed legislation is not a novel concept, but rather a well-reasoned and necessary step towards reducing the risk of teenage driver fatalities.",
            "Upon examining the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I decided to view all 15 trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films primarily relied on creative editing to create illusions. My analysis focused on analyzing the artistic aspects of trick films and identifying the unique characteristics of some of the later films. Early trick films were generally shot on a static set within a frontal proscenium framework, using long and medium shots, and adhering to the convention of one shot per film. However, some early 20th-century films experimented with this approach by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne common trait among trick films is the use of an interior set within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remained stationary, not moving to follow characters or objects. This technique was inspired by theatrical and vaudeville performances, where magic and illusions were common. A notable limitation of this method is that characters' movements were restricted to side-to-side movements, with no ability to move towards or away from the camera. \n\nFor instance, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from one side and move horizontally within the frame. Even when they exit the frame, the camera does not follow them. The frontal proscenium style often resulted in long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-up shots were not used in any of the Edison catalog trick films, as this format was inherited from the theatre and vaudeville traditions, where the audience could see the entire performance within a framed stage. As in early cinema, actors rarely moved towards the camera, making close-ups impossible.\n\nMost early trick films adhered to the convention of one conceptual shot per film, restricting their length to around a minute or less, depending on the frame rate used. This limitation also restricted the narrative and dramatic potential of trick films, which primarily focused on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing acts, and quick changes. However, in trick films, a single conceptual shot might be composed of multiple physical shots, used to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. In the film The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), for example, a closer examination reveals the point where the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the whole film is perceived as one shot.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early advocate for Republicanism, and his profession as an agriculturalist, along with his brief foray into politics, made him known for his unwavering commitment to individual freedom and limited government. His agrarian views served as the foundation for his opinions on governance, as he sought to protect and promote this occupation as the most superior career. This perspective influenced his perspectives on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judicial system, as he aimed to preserve the integrity of what he considered the ideal profession.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a unique opportunity to establish an ideal system of government, free from the constraints of native traditions that might have hindered its development. He firmly believed in the inherent rights of individuals, which are interconnected and interdependent, and that compromising one right would undermine the value of the remaining ones. Consequently, he argued that these rights should be beyond the reach of the government. He saw the concept of the \"state of nature\" as an era where the strong and cunning profited, but in a civilized society, this should not be the case.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor believed that a government must be designed to account for the dual nature of human beings, comprising both good and evil. He adhered to a rigid dualistic morality and contended that a government, being run by humans, would inevitably reflect both its virtues and vices. He defined good principles as those that protect private property, promote agriculture, and discourage capitalism, and believed that a government founded on these principles would function fairly, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by self-interest and avarice. However, he distinguished between self-interest as a motivation for creating a society for the public good and its manifestation as a destructive force that exploits others. A good government was essential to contain humanity's inherent evil, and it must be closely monitored to prevent the introduction of bad principles.\n\nLike many other Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution, limiting the federal government to only the powers explicitly stated in the document. He recognized that an extensive federal government would be costly and prone to despotism, but also believed that a literal interpretation without considering the intent of the Founding Fathers could be hazardous. Moreover, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more explicitly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Analyzing the data in Figure 17, we observed a significant decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project, which was disappointing to note. It's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause for this drop. The onset of winter could have led to a decrease in cycling and walking commutes, and the end of the fall semester might have left some people too busy with schoolwork and end-of-semester tasks to participate. Additionally, the holiday season's timing coincided with the month-long winter break for students and faculty, which likely reduced the need for commuting. The resumption of classes in late January might have also contributed to the low log submissions for that month. Given this context, it's puzzling that the low submission numbers persisted into February. It's possible that the project experienced an initial surge in interest that naturally waned over time, as seen in many similar initiatives. To counteract this decline, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week, a special promotional campaign in March that led to an increase in log submissions. However, we faced challenges in sustaining project momentum, particularly due to the natural decrease in engagement and the impact of holiday and semester breaks on academic settings. Another hurdle in promoting alternative commuting modes is the entrenched cultural preference for driving personal vehicles, which offers a sense of freedom and independence. To encourage participation, we offered prizes in the form of gift certificates to local businesses, but it would have been intriguing to explore the effect of larger, more substantial prizes, such as bicycles or eco-friendly cars. Offering escalating prizes throughout the project might have helped maintain interest, as the initial incentive of gift cards seemed to wane over time. If we had announced more substantial prizes in December and January, participation might have increased instead of decreasing.",
            "An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that mirrors the performance of a specific index, commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund, but offers greater flexibility and trades on a stock exchange like a stock.  ETFs provide the diversification benefits of an index fund and the advantages of individual stock ownership, such as the ability to short sell, buy on margin, and purchase a single share.  While these benefits are highly appealing, the expense ratios of ETFs are lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, there are some drawbacks, including the need to pay a commission for each trade involving ETFs, just like with stock transactions.  One of the significant advantages of ETFs is the wide range of available funds. It is essential for savvy investors to critically evaluate the benefits of ETFs, such as diversification, to determine if they truly exist and to what extent.  In this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to assess whether the benefits of owning a single ETF are comparable to those of a diversified portfolio of the 10 stocks and whether there are alternative configurations that could provide a more optimal risk-adjusted return.\n\nTo simplify the evaluation, we have chosen to focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Below is a list of the top 10 holdings and their respective percentages of total assets.\n\nTo gauge how well the top 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current asset percentages to calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's beta and return if the portfolio consisted entirely of these 10 stocks, in the same proportion as the ETF's holdings. The beta and return calculations are presented in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, it is clear that a portfolio consisting of only the top 10 holdings would generate a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns. It is also evident that the beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. Our preliminary findings suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings may offer higher returns with lower risk. However, there is a possibility that the differences between the two portfolios may not be statistically significant.\n\nTo determine whether these portfolios are statistically different, we calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considers \"Dream-Land\" to be one of his standout poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" twice, which Mabbott attributes to Virgil's work. However, it is unclear if Virgil was the primary source, as Poe was heavily influenced by German literature, particularly the works of Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was a renowned poet who wrote the famous play \"Faust,\" which includes a poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells the story of a king who, after his wife's death, becomes consumed by grief and turns to excessive drinking. The king's descent into despair serves as a poignant parallel to the speaker's experience in \"Dream-Land,\" where he describes a dark and lonely world devoid of color.\n\nInterestingly, Goethe's poem \"The King of Thulé\" bears a striking resemblance to \"Dream-Land.\" In both works, the protagonist grapples with the loss of a loved one and finds solace in drinking. It is possible that Poe was drawing inspiration from Goethe's work. Furthermore, Goethe's influence can be seen in the fact that Poe references Thule twice in his collected writings, once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and again at the beginning and end of \"Dream-Land.\" This repetition suggests that the two poems are companion pieces, with \"Dream-Land\" serving as a dark reflection of \"The King of Thulé.\"\n\nConsidering Goethe's significant impact on the literary world, it is likely that Poe would have been familiar with his work. As a testament to Goethe's reputation, Poe expressed his admiration for Tennyson, indicating that he held Goethe in high esteem. Additionally, the many reproductions of Goethe's works that were published after its initial release would have also exposed Poe to his writing.",
            "Under California law, a customer who suffered an injury after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill at a grocery store may be eligible for punitive damages if it can be proven that the store manager acted with malice, defined as a deliberate disregard for the potential harm that could result from their actions. A court is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages at this stage. To be entitled to punitive damages, Palmer must provide evidence that the store manager's actions were taken with a deliberate and conscious disregard for the potential harm that could occur, as well as proof that the actions were despicable. Palmer can argue that the store manager should have realized the potential harm of not cleaning the spill, given that several customers had previously slipped and fallen in the store before her accident, and despite this knowledge, the manager still failed to clean the spill. Although Palmer's argument that the manager's actions were despicable is not strong, it remains valid given the frequency of slip-and-fall incidents at the store, with six incidents reported in 2009 and the manager failing to take adequate measures to ensure the safety of customers.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee informed the store manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle, but Martin responded that he was on a break and did not have time to deal with customer complaints. Fifteen minutes later, another employee reported the spill, and Martin gave the same response. At 5:30 pm, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, suffering a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at the store in 2009. Palmer is now suing the store for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion to dismiss the punitive damage claim.\n\nUnder California law, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation that is not related to a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, where the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of their actions and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.",
            "It has been almost four years since I took a course on Islam at CBC, which sparked a heated debate in class about whether Islam is inherently hostile.  I believe this question remains more relevant now than ever, especially considering the shift in media's portrayal of Islam and extremists since the events of 9/11.  Looking back, it's remarkable that in 2001, a presidential candidate like Barack Obama with a Muslim background would have been unimaginable. \n\nThe life of the Prophet, as I've learned from its biography, presents a contradictory image of Muhammad, one that diverges from the conventional understanding of his character.  I had previously believed that Muhammad was a forceful leader who coerced people into converting to Islam, but the biography portrays him as a humble figure who was misunderstood and was humbled by others.  As a result, people gradually came to appreciate the truth in his teachings and sought him out. \n\nThere are intriguing parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the accounts of Muhammad's miracles, with one notable instance being the occasion when he multiplied food and drink to feed a group of forty men.  The narrative style employed in the biography creates an image of Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, but instead lived a life of truth and performed miracles.  This portrayal weakens the significance of Jesus Christ's life and miracles, much like a comparison between the two figures.  It is almost as if the authors are attributing the essence of Jesus' life to Muhammad. \n\nThe biography also includes numerous stories that seem to be designed to demonstrate how people independently converted to Islam, but many of these accounts rely on second-hand or even third-hand retellings.  This approach not only diminishes the credibility of the stories but also raises suspicions. \n\nWhat bothers me most about this biography is its attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure who embodies humility, compassion, and wisdom.  However, historical records contradict this image, and I find it puzzling that Muslims today may not be aware of the true circumstances surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus were quickly left behind in the development of Christian thought after his time.  If we look at the history of Christianity in broad terms, we notice a pattern of the faith drifting further and further away from its origins.  Presently, we are witnessing an increased awareness and a growing trend of progress.  Traditional followers may resist any ideas that stray from the teachings they were taught, but their influence may not be significant enough to impact the entire community.  As time passes, Christians will become increasingly aware of their history, and a desire will arise to distinguish between the original intent of Jesus' message and the additional doctrines that have been incorporated into the religion over time.  This process may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome is inevitable:  A reversal of the trend in Christian history will occur, and the faith will return to its original form.  A movement will emerge that will gradually strip away layers of doctrine, much like time moving backward, leaving only the fundamental principles that Jesus introduced, untainted by later interpretations.  When this shift takes hold in the United States and Europe, it will bring about a renewed focus on Jesus' original message, and people will come together to worship in a manner true to his teachings.  The church as an institution will still maintain its strength, guiding the way forward, but the diversity of Christian denominations will give way to increasing uniformity of belief and practice.  We will see a decrease in differences between regions, denominations, and divisions, and an increase in similarities.  History is replete with examples of reversals, such as the transformation of the Roman Empire from a persecutor of Christians to a Christian institution.  Our country has also experienced a similar transformation, evolving from a time of African-American slavery to a period of African-American leadership.  The future holds a similar reversion for Christianity, as it seeks to return to its roots and undo the diversity that has developed over time.  This process will be facilitated by a shift in how Jesus' words are interpreted, from being seen as literal statements to being understood as metaphors.  To understand what has transpired since Jesus' lifetime, we must look back to the early history of Judaism, which served as the foundation for the Christian faith.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the concept of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were already at the heart of the Jewish faith.  The Jewish population was not unified, instead being divided into groups such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people.",
            "I firmly believe that The Jungle reveals the inherent selfishness and self-centered nature of humans. As individuals, people prioritise their own interests over others, striving for personal gain and comfort, regardless of the consequences for those around them. The novel portrays this self-absorption through various examples, particularly in the actions of the factory owners and managers. Driven solely by a desire for expansion and profit, they disregard the well-being of employees, the environment, and even their own workers' safety. Upton Sinclair's vivid descriptions, such as the image of \"the line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky,\" illustrate the devastating impact of pollution caused by these factories. He highlights the owners' callous disregard for those affected by their operations, including the pollution produced by their factories and the unsanitary conditions in the surrounding areas.\n\nThe book also sheds light on the exploitative nature of the owners towards their employees. They show no qualms about sacrificing their workers' welfare in pursuit of profit, as evident from Sinclair's statement that \"there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The employees were forced to work in grueling conditions and were laid off at will, without any support or compensation. During the time period depicted in the novel, the lack of protective laws and regulations enabled the owners to exploit their employees, pushing them to work at an exhausting pace in hazardous conditions. The workers, who lived and worked in Packingtown, were essentially expected to endure these harsh circumstances without any assistance or support. The absence of organisations to provide aid and information to workers, and the shortcomings of unions that profited from their suffering, left them with no escape from the oppressive system. The novel ultimately portrays the workers as being treated like slaves, forced to survive on the whims of their exploiters, and as a result, immorality and desperation became rampant in the community.",
            "Many authors employ various literary techniques to evoke specific emotions or attitudes in their readers. Some methods are more effective than others. In his novel The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes a range of these techniques to create a particular atmosphere. One technique he frequently uses is combining adjectives with nouns in unexpected ways to convey a certain image. Another technique is assigning symbolic meaning to objects and using them to convey a particular message. Fitzgerald applies this latter technique to several colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, he establishes associations for white/gray and red/pink and then leverages these associations to evoke a particular feeling or idea in the reader when describing significant objects.\n\nFitzgerald creates associations for the colors white and gray, with white representing something finer and more refined, while gray symbolizes something older and faded. He establishes these meanings early in the novel by consistently using both colors. For instance, Daisy and Jordan are frequently described wearing white, and others, such as Nick and Tom, also wear white attire. The only time people are not dressed in white is when Nick is describing Gatsby's party, which is \"gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald further defines these colors by associating them with everyday objects and common subjects, such as when Nick goes to work and sees \"white chasms\" in New York City or when the names of people at Gatsby's party are listed as \"gray\" on Nick's schedule. He also describes ordinary people and places as white or gray, like Jordan and Daisy's \"white girlhood\" or the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes.\n\nOnce Fitzgerald establishes these meanings, he uses white and gray to convey the idea that certain subjects are unimportant or mundane. This approach begins with Daisy. After a period of time without using these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as wearing white in a car, which makes her appear less as a distinct character and more as a uniform element that Gatsby desires. He employs this technique with Daisy multiple times to create this image of her being a uniform addition. For example, there is a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and she is again dressed in white before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County has a thriving agricultural sector, primarily due to its pleasant and sunny climate. Local farmers cultivate a variety of crops such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a significant demand for organic community-supported agriculture in the area, with numerous local organizations facing lengthy waiting lists for their produce, including organic eggs and milk. Many organic farms offer guided tours of their operations, allowing visitors to engage in outdoor activities like hiking and birdwatching. This type of farming model enables landowners to participate in government programs, conserve the environment, and create opportunities for recreational activities and educational programs while generating revenue.\n\nIn addition to capitalizing on a lucrative market niche, organic farming has several benefits, including increased biodiversity in the area, thanks to the absence of chemical use in the soil and water. However, organic farming often incurs higher costs compared to conventional methods, requiring more labor and management to control pests and weeds without chemicals, and potentially resulting in greater losses. Small-scale organic farms also face challenges related to efficiency and scale, especially when compared to larger operations. Furthermore, practices beneficial to wildlife, such as planting cover crops and removing invasive species, can also be labor-intensive. These factors highlight the need for landowners to seek financial assistance or expertise in optimizing both profitability and environmental quality.\n\nThe chosen property, located near the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California, is a 160-acre parcel featuring chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This area falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which aims to protect over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nThis land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 19th century. The property was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and wood production for many years. To better understand the viable options for a small farmer in this area, a search of real estate websites and government programs was conducted. A comparable organic farm in the same region was identified as a model for potential operations.",
            "Effective negotiation relies heavily on understanding the nuances of culture, which cannot be defined by a single, fixed identity. Rather, it encompasses a complex web of what it signifies and what it's not. It's essential to recognize that cultures are diverse, multifaceted, and not limited to national or geographical boundaries. A culture's generalizations, such as labeling an entire nation as stubborn or accommodating, are overly simplistic and lack depth. To be productive in negotiation, one must consider the significance of a culture to the specific situation at hand and how its attitudes will influence the negotiation process.\n\nWhen interacting with a foreign culture, we tend to draw comparisons to our own, which can lead to oversimplification. A more effective approach is to accept and respect the culture for what it is, rather than trying to change or judge it. This is particularly crucial when negotiating with a weaker bargaining position. Recognizing and respecting the traditions and beliefs of the opposing culture can help overcome cultural barriers and facilitate progress in the negotiation.\n\nFurthermore, corporate culture can be just as distinct as national culture, with its own set of values, norms, and practices. A company's culture can be observed in its dress code, communication style, delegation of tasks, and hiring practices. This diversity is evident within a nation, with variations between companies and even within the same company across different regions and environments. It's essential to look beyond the surface level and appreciate the complexity of a culture.\n\nUnderstanding the values that drive a culture is crucial, as they reveal the underlying motivations and priorities. For instance, if saving face or communal harmony is valued, a negotiator will avoid public embarrassment or conflict to achieve success. On the other hand, if a culture prioritizes hard-driving bargains, a negotiator may be more likely to push for a deal. Considering these cultural differences before the negotiation is vital, but it's equally important to gain a personal understanding of the opposing party to create a more effective negotiation strategy.",
            "The phrase, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" originates in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and serves as the foundation of St. Anselm's argument for the existence of God. Interestingly, Thomas Aquinas shares a similar perspective on this issue. Since both authors present arguments in favor of the same concept, we will assume, for the sake of clarity, that both believe in the existence of the God described in the Bible. Focusing on a different concept of God would hinder a fair comparison between their arguments. Although each author raises valid points, neither provides a comprehensive basis for believing in God.\n\nTo illustrate this, we will first examine St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm's reasoning suggests a path of understanding that involves looking inward to find evidence of God's existence within one's own mind. He proposes that since God is a concept that we can understand, we cannot conceive of a world without him. In essence, Anselm argues that the proof for God lies within our own consciousness, and that we don't need external evidence to confirm his existence. This idea is closely tied to the concept of faith, where one accepts truth without absolute empirical proof, which is a common theme in Christian texts.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas presents a vastly different perspective. He believes that the existence of God can be proven solely through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith altogether. This approach could be beneficial for Christian evangelism as it would allow new converts to be persuaded by logic rather than relying on their willingness to accept something unproven. Aquinas supports his argument with five logical arguments: those of change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. By demonstrating the logical necessity of God's existence, Aquinas essentially shows that the existence of God is a fundamental requirement for understanding the world. Analogously, if you're given a puzzle with missing pieces, you can logically infer the features and existence of the missing piece even if you can't see it.",
            "About 2,500 years ago, a prince who would later be known as the Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned worldly life and attained enlightenment, which led to the development of Buddhism. The most traditional form of this religion is Theravada Buddhism, which has undergone significant changes since the Buddha's time. This can be observed in the annual Water-cutting ceremony in Sri Lanka, a Theravada nation, where both monks and lay people participate. The ceremony holds spiritual significance even though the Buddha never taught about any such celebration. This shows the extent to which the Theravada Buddhist community has adapted its core principles over time, influenced by both internal and external factors, both positive and negative.\n\nTo better understand this discussion, it's essential to understand the following key terms: internal and external forces, and hostile and benign influences. An internal force refers to any change initiated by members of the Buddhist community, regardless of their monastic status. An external force, on the other hand, comes from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any influence that causes harm or intends to harm the community, stemming from a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force, while not malicious, may unintentionally harm or benefit the community.\n\nThe discussion begins by examining the fundamental principles of Theravada Buddhism. At its core, Buddhists seek refuge in the 'Triple Gem': the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka, a collection of three baskets containing Buddhist scriptures. These include the Sutta Pitaka (Suttas), Vinaya Pitaka (disciplinary rules), and Abhidhamma Pitaka (metaphysical concepts). Key metaphysical ideas in Buddhism include the concept of Anatta (no permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these principles is crucial to breaking free from the cycle of death and rebirth (Samsara). Along with Samsara, one can overcome the causes of suffering, which include lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), upon achieving enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for laypeople and monks, with five precepts for the former (do not kill, lie, steal, engage in immoral conduct, or take intoxicants) and more rules for the latter. The Four Noble Truths form the foundation of Buddhist doctrine: the existence of suffering, its cause (attachment), and the possibility of overcoming it.",
            "The United States and Mexico serve as a striking example of two nations that were embroiled in a long-standing rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893, as documented by Diehl and Goerts (2000, p. 145). A pivotal moment in this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States defeated Mexico and successfully annexed Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Apart from this significant conflict, numerous other clashes took place between the two nations, eventually subsiding just before the onset of World War I. The underlying causes of this rivalry were rooted in fundamental disagreements over issues such as religion, culture, and tradition, alongside divergent material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis scenario is reminiscent of many other nations that have a long-standing rivalry with a neighboring country. Shared borders often give rise to conflicting interests, ultimately contributing to the formation of rival positions between the nations. The United States and Mexico are not exceptional in this regard, as David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that they are among the few nations that have consistently presented long-lasting diplomatic challenges to the United States, particularly compared to other Latin American countries that have historically enjoyed good relations with the US.\n\nThe religious differences between the two nations played a significant role in exacerbating the rift, a phenomenon that has been observed in many historical conflicts. According to Sally Frahm (2001), Americans were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries, much like their opposition to fascism and communism in the 20th century (p. 86). The ideological tensions between the United States and Mexico were, in this case, primarily driven by differences in religious preferences, rather than political structures. This mistrust was largely inherited from the distrust between the English and Spanish, making it a major obstacle to establishing amicable relations between the two nations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identify 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States that occurred during the 57-year period of rivalry. The majority of these disputes involved territorial issues, including border raids and frontier problems, such as those caused by Mexican bandits and outlaws from American border towns. These issues persisted until both nations deployed military force to secure their borders (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry between the two nations began to subside as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States and eventually ceased as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the latter part of the 19th century (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly afflicted with a condition I had never known existed while working as a nurse. Growing up, I had chosen nursing as a profession due to its stability and security, which was something I lacked as a child. People consistently told me, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" Although my true ambitions were to be a scientist or journalist, I settled for nursing. Now, at 46 and single, I have exhausted my savings and am unable to work due to my ongoing disability. I've relied on Social Security Disability for 15 years and have nothing to call my own. Each day is a struggle to ensure my safety, security, and self-worth. However, I've come to realize that without the support of my family and a few close friends, I wouldn't have made it. \n\nMy experience has taught me that we can never truly be prepared for every life emergency, no matter how well we plan. I agree that we should reduce our reliance on the government, which is often unstable. Nevertheless, I believe it's more crucial for Americans to relearn the importance of helping one another and asking for assistance. This attitude is more essential than individual survival tactics like building personal shelters. \n\nThe idea of \"rugged individualism,\" often promoted by Conservatives, is a myth. In reality, it was the compassion and collective support of our ancestors that helped them overcome hardships. Pioneers who crossed the country didn't achieve their goals alone; they relied on each other for aid and resources.\n\nWhile being prepared is vital, it's equally essential to build connections with those around you. I have a disaster kit and supplies, but I also believe in getting to know my neighbors. If possible, having a small farm and being able to preserve food can be beneficial. Additionally, owning a wood stove can be useful, but it's only feasible for those living in rural areas.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in a particular way remains a complex and multifaceted issue, with various factors influencing the direction of evolutionary change. Although the foundations of evolutionary biology have been laid, the field still lacks a comprehensive mathematical framework to describe even the simplest organic forms. Recent advancements in mathematical modeling have been applied to the development and evolution of mollusk shells, considering both the growth of individual organisms (ontogeny) and the history of their species (phylogeny). Our study aims to combine mathematical modeling with experimental research to uncover the underlying mechanisms driving the pace and extent of evolutionary-developmental change in the Prunum species. By analyzing X-ray images of Prunum species, we have identified quantifiable parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell, allowing us to simulate diverse shell shapes and explore the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. Our results are being integrated with experimental and observational studies to gain a deeper understanding of the major evolutionary events within this group of organisms.\n\nA mollusk shell can be thought of as a spiral structure that grows over time, spanning 360 degrees of space. The spiral turns or whorls of a coiled shell are arranged around an imaginary central axis, known as the columella, which runs through the central column of the shell. The rate at which the whorls expand can vary, and the continuous line separating each whorl is called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the body whorl, while the spire consists of all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different perspectives, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. The conventional orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count the number of whorls, an individual shell should be viewed from the apical perspective. The first suture is identified, and a line is drawn to divide the shell into two parts. Whorls are then counted from this line, with each whorl estimated to a quarter of a turn.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a series of openings that evolve over time and space as the animal builds its shell. By tracing the path of the aperture, which can be defined by the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture, we can graphically and mathematically represent the shell's growth pattern. Once a mathematical model is established, we can manipulate parameters to simulate changes in the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Despite some stabilization in neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia over the past decade, the country is still facing significant challenges in meeting its Millennium Development Goals, particularly in the areas of child and maternal health.  While Indonesia is making progress in certain areas, such as water and sanitation, the country's improvements in healthcare are lagging behind the required pace to meet its 2015 targets.  This situation necessitates strengthening of the overall healthcare system rather than focusing solely on specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has achieved some positive milestones, including an increase in the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% of births meeting this target.  However, this statistic includes traditional workers like midwives who may not be equipped to handle complications, resulting in high maternal mortality rates due to factors such as hemorrhage.  This improvement appears somewhat misleading, highlighting the need for further action.  Additionally, there has been a decline in the percentage of children under five treated by a healthcare professional for diarrheal cases, and postnatal care data is incomplete, indicating a pressing concern in this area.\n\nRegarding cesarean-section rates, Indonesia's rates are lower than expected, at around 4%, and this disparity is particularly concerning given the significant gap in rates between urban and rural areas, with urban settings recording a 7% rate compared to a mere 2% in rural areas.  This underscores the issue of unequal access to healthcare services across the country, with urban areas receiving more attention.  Another issue is vertical equity, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, suggesting that the poor face significant barriers in accessing healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nIn determining the most effective approach to improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is how to address the lack of access to healthcare services.  The key consideration is whether Indonesia should adopt program-specific approaches or strengthen its overall healthcare system without focusing solely on pre- and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children.  While programmatic approaches have the advantage of being more targeted and yielding faster results, they also have drawbacks, such as diverting resources away from other areas of the health sector and creating duplication of services and inefficient use of resources.  These challenges highlight the need for a more comprehensive approach to healthcare reform in Indonesia.",
            "Victorian novels are characterized by their meticulous attention to detail and a focus on the social elite of the time.  Two notable exceptions to this trend are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which deviate from the norm by incorporating elements of mystery and the unusual. These unconventional features heighten the complexity of the characters within each novel, offering deeper insights into their motivations and emotions.\n\nThis unorthodox approach is often achieved through dream sequences or dreamlike states, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy blur. In Oliver Twist, these enigmatic events frequently shed light on Oliver's inner struggles, revealing the pains and fears that haunt him. The repeated depiction of Oliver's reliving of the shooting incident in chapter 28 serves to emphasize his lack of agency and control over his circumstances. The passage highlights Oliver's diminished capacity for action, as he is overwhelmed by his emotions and unable to intervene, even when his life is at stake. This sense of powerlessness is further underscored by the description of his hallucinations, which are a manifestation of his deep-seated despair and fear. The shooting sequence also raises questions about the nature of fate versus free will, as it is clear that Oliver's misfortune is not a result of his own actions, but rather a consequence of external forces beyond his control. Furthermore, this episode implies a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if he has been broken by his circumstances, leading to a diminished capacity for resistance and self-preservation.\n\nThe passage also alludes to the cyclical nature of time, where days blend together in a seemingly endless cycle of darkness and brief moments of consciousness. The night is portrayed as both interminable and fleeting, a symbol of the monotony and despair that pervades Oliver's life.",
            "It's been a while since I worked in an after-school program where I helped elementary school students with their studies. My areas of expertise were in English and reading, so I focused on assisting students with those subjects. I was approached by one of the instructors to work with a boy named Adrian, who struggled with reading. As I observed him, I realized that something was amiss - he had a peculiar reading pattern; he could pronounce some letters correctly while others were completely off. It was a peculiar observation, especially considering his background, which I believed to be Latino, and the fact that he spoke fluent English. I eventually met his mother, who only spoke Spanish, and through my limited Spanish skills, I learned that the issue wasn't a lack of reading abilities, but rather unfamiliarity with the English alphabet. This understanding led me to hope that some guidance might be helpful in addressing his struggles.\n\nI share this story to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, particularly in California. It's essential to recognize that even students who speak English fluently can face significant challenges with reading. I believe that everyone acknowledges this problem exists, so let's explore potential solutions. In Adrian's case, individualized English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation, seemed like a viable approach. However, for students with limited English proficiency, the solution is more complex and multifaceted. No single approach, such as dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, or ESL classes, will suffice on its own. A comprehensive strategy that integrates these methods is necessary.\n\nThe dual language system is a promising idea that benefits not only English language learners but all students. Research has shown that children in bilingual education programs tend to outperform their peers academically. Some may believe that these programs are a waste of resources or that the majority of students won't benefit, but this misconception can be addressed by implementing such programs on a larger scale. To make this work, we don't need to require all teachers to be bilingual, which would be impractical. Instead, we can provide bilingual support staff, tutors, or aides to supplement the existing teaching staff.",
            "From a young age, most of us are told that there is something greater than ourselves, a concept that transcends our understanding. Some people attend religious institutions like Sunday school, temple, or search within themselves for answers, while others may adopt the faith of their upbringing. However, a few individuals reject these beliefs, insisting that there is no truth beyond their own personal reality. Throughout life, people may change their values and spiritual perspectives as they seek meaning and purpose. This search for a guiding light can be a universal human quest. \n\nAs I spent time with my father on the porch, watching the rain, he revealed his love for cardinals. His distant expression hinted at a mix of contemplation and nostalgia. His appearance had changed due to illness, and he seemed to be avoiding eye contact. I felt a deep sense of loneliness and anxiety, unable to discuss my impending loss, as talking about it would make the reality even more unbearable. I turned to physical comfort by hugging him and sitting closer. I joined him in gazing out into the rain, trying to connect with him one last time.\n\nMy father passed away in December, just a few days after my 22nd birthday. The treatment prolonged his life, but it couldn't ease his suffering. I struggled to comprehend the value of prolonging his suffering. I questioned the existence of a benevolent God, wondering if he had stopped listening to me long ago. I chose not to watch his final moments, as it would have been too painful to witness the end of the person who brought me into this world. I preferred to remember him as he lived, not as he died. I knew my father would not have wanted me to be present during his passing, so I didn't attend. I locked myself in my room for three days, waiting for the news to arrive.\n\nThe painful absence of a phone call underscored my sense of isolation during that difficult time.",
            "Ian Watt describes the traditional Gothic Novel as a contradictory term that combines the concepts of \"old\" and \"new,\" as seen in his work \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel.\" The Gothic mode has been met with both criticism and praise, with some viewing it as lacking depth and others admiring its ability to evoke a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). The original Gothic Novel, \"The Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole, drew inspiration from both ancient and modern romance styles to create a new genre and literary expression. By combining old theatrical elements with modern novelistic techniques, Walpole presented what he called a \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre incorporates elements from medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated in comparison to modern societal and literary advancements.\n\nThe combination of the theatrical aspects of the Gothic style and the innovative format of the novel, which allows readers a more personal insight into character psychology, has contributed to the genre's enduring appeal and timeless quality. Despite being considered outdated, the Gothic genre remains relevant to readers from different eras, offering a unique blend of old and new.\n\nOne of the key ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of chivalry. The medieval notion of chivalry, which involves the training of a knight, is reinterpreted and reimagined in \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Chivalry is significant to Gothic writers because it represents an idealized image of a brave, honorable, and competent knight, which they perceived as lacking in their own society. By incorporating chivalric concepts and ideals, Gothic writers idealized and romanticized the past, foreshadowing the evolution of the genre into Romanticism. This nostalgia for a bygone era is also a commentary on the perceived moral decline of society, particularly during times of political turmoil. In the case of \"The Castle of Otranto,\" the character of Frederic embodies many chivalric traits, as evident in his description, which includes images of a gallant and courteous knight who has suffered and is now presumed dead. This portrayal exemplifies the Gothic trope of excess, which is a recurring theme in the genre.",
            "Supply chain management encompasses a series of interconnected processes that span from the initial customer order to the delivery of products. The concept of supply chain management was first introduced by Keith Oliver in 1982, a consultant who described the process of planning, implementing, and overseeing the supply chain to meet customer needs efficiently. The six core components of a supply chain are production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. By leveraging these elements, business managers can provide top-notch customer service.\n\nProduction is the foundational step in the supply chain process, involving the planning and execution of when, where, and how products will be created. To determine customer requirements, managers analyze market trends, which serve as a crucial indicator of customer demands. Once market analysis is complete, they decide what products to produce, in what quantities, and allocate the production to the most suitable facilities, considering factors like volume and quality to meet customer expectations. Effective production planning is critical, as any lapses can result in substantial time and financial losses.\n\nThe second crucial element in supply chain management is supply, which involves strategic decisions regarding a facility's core capabilities and partnerships. Companies may have multiple divisions for producing a single product, each with unique equipment, personnel, and expertise. Managers must determine the most suitable division for each process and consider outsourcing to other companies to enhance velocity, a concept that enables quality, flexibility, and cost reduction. By streamlining processes, companies can achieve success in the competitive market.",
            "Ellen Page holds a haunting sign on a street corner, claiming that Hitler is alive in Burma, also known as Myanmar. Burma is a Southeast Asian country under the control of a ruthless military junta that seized power in 1962 through a military coup. In 2007, a wave of public protests erupted, led by a large number of Burmese monks, earning the name \"The Saffron Revolution\" due to the color of their robes. As the protests gained momentum, the government initially permitted the monks to hold peaceful gatherings, but violence escalated into a brutal conflict between the military and the monks, with the military invading monasteries and detaining foreign journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist who was killed while covering a protest. The true extent of the violence is estimated to be much higher than reported, with credible sources suggesting that thousands of people had been killed.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident, for the suppression of dissent and authoritarian rule have been recurring themes throughout history. From ancient Roman emperors claiming divine right to rule to modern-day examples like the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, where China's government brutally cracked down on peaceful demonstrators, and the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups and the government systematically targeted Tutsis and moderate politicians, the desire for total control over the population has been a persistent phenomenon. The Nazi regime's systematic persecution of Jews during World War II is another harrowing example of this trend.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring legacy in jazz can be attributed to his notable longevity and exceptional creativity, particularly in his ability to lead his orchestra. While Ellington's piano presence is subtle in many of his compositions, as a composer, he excelled in crafting intricate and complex pieces that showcased the individual talents of his band members. By designing a framework for improvisation and writing tightly orchestrated arrangements, Ellington enabled soloists to shine while also emphasizing the unique sound of the entire ensemble. This mastery of individual player styles and their harmonious integration allowed him to create groundbreaking pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative approach to music, citing Creole Love Call, where he employed the human voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This piece exemplifies his practice of incorporating voice to add texture and depth without the constraints of lyrics, demonstrating his ability to complement the style of his soloists. A notable example of this is Creole Love Call, a slow twelve-bar blues with six distinct choruses that showcase Ellington's versatility. These choruses include:\n\n- Chorus 1: A call-and-response pattern between voice and reeds, starting with smooth and melodic vocals and transitioning to a rougher tone.\n- Chorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the melody and emphasizes extended blue notes.\n- Chorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n- Chorus 4: A full band echo of the first chorus, featuring a call-and-response between the brass and reed sections.\n- Chorus 5: The climactic chorus, where the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\n- Chorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call-and-response between voice and reeds, this time with the voice adopting a growl-like tone and soloing as an instrument.\n- A brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add tonal color to Creole Love Call illustrates a recurring stylistic trait in his work. His later piece, Hot and Bothered, showcases his skill at tight orchestration and sensitivity to tone color. In this work, Ellington combines his talents by pairing a call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing, blending the vocal aspects of Miley's playing and the instrumental qualities of Cox's voice. His piece It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends this concept by effectively utilizing Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "She had always felt an unfulfilled longing, a yearning that never seemed to be satisfied. This desire had been present since she was 14 and in the midst of her teenage years, and it persisted at 17. At this stage, she realized she was searching for a person rather than an object, but she found no interest in any of the boys who had shown interest in her. Some had attempted to win her over, but none had sparked her attraction. She frequently questioned herself about this unusual phenomenon, trying to identify the reason behind it. Over the years, various theories came to mind, but none were convincing enough to satisfy her curiosity. As a result, she continued to navigate life with unanswered questions about her desires.\n\nTypically, her home was a peaceful place, filled with her calm and composed parents. They rarely argued with each other, and disagreements with their daughter were extremely rare. The only time they disagreed was when she asserted her independence and individuality. As the daughter of a calm couple, she stood out with her lively and fun personality, making her endearing to those around her.\n\nHowever, today was not a typical day. While searching for inspiration, she heard her mother's anguished cry and the sound of her injured voice coming from the kitchen. Panicked, she rushed into the room, exclaiming, \"Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the ground, writhing in pain and repeatedly uttering \"Ow\" in short gasps. Her daughter immediately ran to her side and placed a hand on her to offer assistance. \"It hurts so much... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother stammered between gasps. The daughter could sense the severity of her mother's pain. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where I should pick you up,\" she replied. Her mother directed her, and the daughter was grateful for her physical training, as she carefully lifted her mother and carried her to the car, placing her in the backseat.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought the pungent smells of disinfectant and illness, mixed with an air of anxiety. But her daughter's focus was solely on her mother's well-being as she quickly entered the hospital and called for medical assistance. The medical staff rushed to her side, and someone swiftly wheeled a hospital bed over and helped her mother onto it. The doctors immediately began assessing her condition, leaving the daughter to sit anxiously in the waiting area. It turned out that her mother had fallen off a step stool while trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "The purpose of this study was to determine whether adherence to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet, a modified version of the Med diet, is characterized by higher consumption of plant-based foods, including plant proteins, monounsaturated fats, and fish, as well as lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is also permitted.\n\nPrevious studies have shown an inverse relationship between adherence to the Med diet and total and cardiovascular mortality, with one intervention trial demonstrating that the Med diet is more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, previous research did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study involved 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 without a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. Over six periods from 1984 to 2004, the researchers computed an aMed diet score from self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake over the past year. More than 95% of the nurses continued their participation throughout the 20-year study period. The FFQs underwent validation studies, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. If necessary, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions falling into this category. The researchers also calculated body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use for each FFQ, with leisure-time physical activity being assessed starting in 1986.\n\nTo minimize random variation and more accurately represent long-term dietary habits, the researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs (averaging scores from two prior years). They also made adjustments for potential confounders, including age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nTo analyze the relationship between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, the researchers used Cox proportional-hazard modeling with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nThe results showed that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, is associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 cases of CHD, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the top aMed quintile were found to be at a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The United States faced a severe economic downturn in 2007, characterized by a sharp increase in unemployment and a dramatic collapse of the housing market. This ongoing recession has led to questions about the causes of this crisis and how it can be prevented. In essence, the financial crisis was triggered by misguided and shortsighted policy decisions that pressured banks to issue high-risk sub-prime loans into an already fragile financial system. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two influential mortgage underwriters, were compelled to purchase and repackage these mortgages into complex financial instruments, which eventually became a liability when borrowers defaulted. The banks, lacking sufficient capital reserves, shifted the burden to the repackaged mortgages they had sold and, subsequently, to the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the crisis date back to 1999, when the Clinton administration's goal of securing a second term in office led to relaxed lending regulations. This move set the stage for the subsequent sub-prime crisis seven years later. As reported by Steven Holmes of the New York Times in 1999, Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, was under pressure from the Clinton administration and its shareholders to expand mortgage lending to low- and moderate-income individuals, potentially jeopardizing its financial stability. Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions, warning that the government-subsidized corporation might require a government bailout, akin to the savings and loan industry's rescue in the 1980s.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the proliferation of complex mortgage structures such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These financial instruments entwined various sectors of the economy with the housing market, leaving U.S. households and financial markets vulnerable to even minor fluctuations in property prices. The housing bubble eventually burst, exposing the financial institutions that had invested in these mortgage-backed securities to significant losses. By 2007, the top U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, representing approximately 30% of the U.S. GDP. As a result, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a discount, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to convert to commercial banks with strict regulatory oversight. Fannie and Freddie accumulated $5 trillion in mortgage debt, ultimately necessitating government intervention in September 2008.",
            "Exposition - the part of your story where you take to the skies, flaunting your writing skills, but often leaving your readers yawning or hitting the back button instead. Even seasoned writers like Dr. Merlin have been known to groan at the sight of too much unnecessary information, much to the dismay of their monitor.\n\nExposition is not a friend to writers. While many are familiar with the advice \"Show, don't tell,\" it's a rule that Dr. Merlin finds herself breaking all too often. She knows that exposition can be a snare, luring you into lengthy passages where little happens or worse, nothing of significance unfolds.\n\nAt its core, exposition is about telling the reader what's happened, often in a straightforward manner. It's akin to a character dumping a wealth of information on another in a film or the author doing the same in fiction. A common example of exposition is when a story tells the reader about a character's past, such as their childhood, marriage, or a pivotal event, without showing the essence of these experiences.\n\nConsider a scenario where a story reveals that the heroine met her spouse at a specific time and place, got married, and lost them tragically. You wouldn't expect this sequence to unfold over multiple pages without any meaningful character development. Instead, the author should delve deeper into the husband's character through their dialogue, mannerisms, and actions, allowing the reader to form a connection with them. This would also provide insight into the heroine's character, their relationship, and their emotional growth.\n\nA good story should offer more than just the bare bones of the plot: \"They met, they married, he died.\" As a writer, it's your job to add depth and complexity to these simple events. While it's tempting to rush through exposition, especially when introducing new characters, it's essential to resist this urge. For instance, instead of listing a character's entire life history, background, and interests, consider showing these aspects through their actions, dialogue, and interactions with others.",
            "I watched two breaking news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio on August 13, 2011. The first live news cast was from NBC 4 in the morning. The main story they covered was about a fatal stabbing incident in Ashley, Ohio, where a man named Shad Hostettler allegedly attacked his wife. Although his wife's name was not revealed, her husband's mug shot was displayed, which seemed menacing. The news team devoted around two minutes to this developing story, providing details that the victim had been stabbed multiple times and the perpetrator had been apprehended. I believe they allocated sufficient time for this story.\n\nThe subsequent story reported an early morning shooting incident involving 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured and there were no arrests or suspects at the time. The SWAT team was conducting an investigation. Notably, this story seemed to be brief, and I suspect it might have been due to the fact that the victim was a member of a minority group, as I have observed a pattern of underreporting of crimes involving minority victims. Typically, when a white individual is a victim of a crime, the media gives it extensive coverage, but minority victims often do not receive the same level of attention.\n\nThe news then shifted to a report about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. The details provided suggested the incident occurred in a specific location, and it was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle had hit the aircraft. Crime-Stoppers were offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe following story covered the weather forecast for the upcoming weekend, predicting rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to remain in the mid-to-low eighties. Although the segment was brief, it served as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nAnother story reported a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, approximately six feet tall, and weighing around 150 pounds. I found it striking that the news team emphasized the perpetrator's racial appearance and skin tone extensively.\n\nThe final story featured Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin who had been found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. What caught my attention was the way the news team presented his sentence – instead of stating 25 years in prison, they mentioned \"300 months.\" I am unsure if this was intended to make the sentence sound more severe or if there was another motive behind it. Additionally, the report noted that Rodriguez was a Hispanic man, which seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "A bond between brothers is a powerful and unbreakable connection that encompasses a wide range of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. This unique relationship allows brothers to deeply understand one another, often seeing themselves reflected in their sibling. The complexity of this bond becomes evident in times of crisis, when the true nature of their feelings – whether positive or negative – is revealed. As brothers navigate the consequences of these emotions, they gain insight into their own character through their actions and the outcomes that result from them.\n\nIn the novel \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers delve into the intricacies of this theme, accompanied by the intense emotions that come with it. Set against a vivid backdrop, the two boys embark on a doomed journey that pits bitter disappointment against intense pride in a climactic confrontation, ultimately leaving only one brother alive. The novel explores this theme through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with his brother, as well as the narrator's perspective, which conveys the complex feelings and worldview of the protagonist, both of which significantly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are primarily driven by one dominant emotion: pride. From their initial outings together to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist harbors a deep-seated resentment towards Doodle. His idealized vision of a brother who could share in his experiences and adventures is shattered by Doodle's fragile health, making it unlikely that he would ever be able to participate in physical activities. This crushing reality is compounded by the protagonist's own fantasies, which are slowly deflated as he comes to terms with Doodle's limitations. Although he contemplates harming his brother, the child's smile momentarily rekindles the protagonist's love and compassion, revealing a conflicted inner state. This internal conflict suggests that his initial thoughts were not firmly rooted, and that a deep-seated love for his brother ultimately prevails.",
            "The human brain is a highly intricate and creative system for processing information. Throughout the evolution of technology, the metaphors used to describe the brain have also evolved. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, followed by a sheet of papyrus, then a book, and more recently, a computer. However, it is crucial to remember that these metaphors have limitations and may lead to incorrect conclusions.\n\nThe process of information processing begins with the sensory organs converting physical stimuli into electrochemical signals. These signals are then repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing initially assembles basic information such as color, orientation, and the location of object borders to conclude that you are seeing a box. Subsequently, top-down processing utilizes the decisions made in the bottom-up process to expedite your recognition of the box, allowing you to identify it as a black box rather than a hole in the background.\n\nOnce information has been processed to a certain extent, an attention filter determines the signal's importance and which cognitive processes it should be made accessible to. This is evident in how your brain filters out individual blades of grass when you look down, yet you can focus on your name when spoken in a noisy environment. There are multiple stages of processing, with the results of processing modulated by attention at each stage.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it first needs to store it. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, with different types of encoding suitable for each type of sensory input. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on its structural appearance, phonetic sound, or semantic meaning. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Research on animals suggests that working memory, which retains information for approximately 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal looping through a specific series of neurons for a short duration. In contrast, long-term memory is hypothesized to be preserved in the structure of specific proteins.\n\nThere are numerous theories on how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on human subjects' memory retrieval, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that there are nodes representing concepts, which are connected based on their relationships. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which in turn can be associated with \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the looming threat of technology and its reinforcement by a capitalistic system in his dystopian novel, Brave New World. The novel portrays a society that prioritizes community over individuality, conditioning its citizens to pursue instant gratification above all else. However, beneath this façade, the citizens are mere pawns in a larger game controlled by the World Controller, who dictates a singular ideology. Analyzing the novel through the lens of Marxist theory reveals Huxley's underlying concerns about the development of these systems. The novel incorporates Marxist terminology, such as homogenization and reification, to highlight its commentary on the flaws of the emerging economy during Huxley's time.\n\nThe novel satirizes capitalism by illustrating the concept of false consciousness, where the common citizenry is kept ignorant of their true socioeconomic relationships. They are consumed by a desire for personal gain, a result of the ideological control exerted over the proletariat and working class, as seen in the conditioned people of Brave New World. The lower classes, represented by groups like Delta and Gamma, lack genuine autonomy, as their drive to consume and indulge is artificially strengthened through hypnopædia. This manipulation is orchestrated by the World Controller, exemplifying the concept of hegemony, where a dominant group exercises control over other social classes. The lower classes are oblivious to their manipulation, unwittingly accepting an ideology that perpetuates the capitalist structure. In contrast, the upper classes, represented by Alphas and Betas, are aware of their circumstances but often remain complacent, with few exceptions like Bernard.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between individuals are superficial, and the characters lack depth. This may suggest that the rise of technology and capitalism erodes human free will and self-expression. The novel's portrayal of interactions, often reduced to shallow comments about physical appearance, highlights the absence of genuine emotions and connections. Furthermore, the societal classes' acceptance of their positions in the hierarchy underscores the socioeconomic impact of capitalism, as they conform to their roles and obey the norms of their peers. This illustrates the Marxist concept of the proletariat, who are misled into believing in their own superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for almost three years, which is equivalent to five semesters. For many students, including myself, navigating the campus can be quite challenging. During my first year, I lived in East Halls, which is situated at the easternmost part of campus, excluding the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. The distance between my dorm in Stuart Hall and my classes in buildings like the Willard building, near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes to cover on foot, especially on bad weather days, which are frequent in State College. I spoke to a recent alumnus who shared with me that not long ago, East Halls was separated from the rest of the campus by a large empty area. This vacant space has since been developed with sports fields, new buildings such as the Creamery and the health services building, and surrounding apartments. As the campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another is becoming increasingly difficult. In a college setting, I firmly believe that the most effective solution to this mobility issue is to use bicycles. However, owning a bike alone is not enough; students must be willing to ride them, and the campus infrastructure needs to be designed with the needs of cyclists in mind.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who had recently taken up cycling again after a several-year hiatus. He expressed his surprise that he had stopped cycling in the first place, stating that \"cycling is the best way to get around.\" Besides being beneficial for one's physical health, cycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. Combining a nutritious meal, such as oatmeal, with moderate physical exertion can take you up to 30 miles or more. Like many of my fellow undergraduates, I now reside off-campus, which is just as far from the campus center as some dorms. My decision to purchase a bike has been one of the most practical choices I made this year. Every day, I attend classes in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. However, with my bike, I can reach the building in just 5 minutes if I pedal at a sufficient pace. The only drawback is that Pollock Road, which is the most direct route to Thomas building from my residence, is not always an easy road to navigate, whether by bike or on foot. While walking has its own advantages, I simply don't have the time for it. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would take me an additional 30-40 minutes each day to reach Thomas building. That's over two hours per week, which is a substantial time commitment. Considering the cumulative time spent walking to and from other classes, appointments, and other activities, it would be even more time-consuming. Given my schedule, I couldn't afford to spare that much time."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "As I pursue a degree in social work, I aim to embark on a career path within the Division of Family and Children Services, where I can make a positive impact on the lives of children who have been abused or neglected, and provide support to families in need. My commitment to this field is driven by a set of core values, including a strong sense of service, respect for others, a commitment to upholding ethical standards, and a dedication to fostering healthy relationships between individuals. These values not only resonate with me professionally but also hold personal significance.\n\nMy desire to help others has been a long-standing aspect of my personality, although I initially struggled to identify a career path that aligned with this passion. Throughout my high school and college years, I observed individuals frequently avoiding their problems and adopting unconventional coping mechanisms. These experiences prompted me to choose a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, which, however, did not initially clarify my career direction. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break before encountering a pivotal experience that shifted my perspective. I met a 16-year-old boy who was fleeing his abusive home and had called the police for assistance. Upon learning of the situation, I visited the boy's parents' residence, where I expressed my concerns to the police and offered to talk to the parents. My conversation with them raised red flags, as they seemed evasive and made excuses for the boy's behavior. This encounter instilled in me a strong desire to pursue a career in social work, which I believe will enable me to make a difference in the lives of children and families facing similar challenges.\n\nAnother essential value in the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we often claim to value individuality, yet we often conform to traditional norms. I, on the other hand, believe in embracing my uniqueness and not limiting myself to societal expectations. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively spoke out against social injustices, whether through self-expression (e.g., unconventional hairstyles, piercings), my involvement with the Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance, or advocating against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it. My commitment to social justice remains unwavering, and I intend to continue fighting for equality and human rights.",
            "This paper delves into the dual perspectives of biological and sociocultural models in understanding the complex nature of insomnia, a sleep disorder that affects individuals worldwide. The biological model centers on the genetic and medical aspects of sleep, encompassing heritable factors and physiological processes. Conversely, the sociocultural model examines the environmental factors, including demographics, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity, which play a significant role in shaping sleep patterns. This comprehensive review aims to explore these models by analyzing relevant research and critiquing its strengths and limitations.\n\nInsomnia can be classified into three primary categories: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to mental health conditions, and sleep disorders caused by medical complications or substance intake. Primary sleep disorders, such as Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, are characterized by difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep or experiencing behavioral and physiological abnormalities during sleep. Dyssomnias, which include conditions like insomnia and hypersomnia, are marked by difficulties in falling asleep or staying awake, respectively. In contrast, Parasomnias, including nightmare disorder and sleepwalking disorder, are associated with behavioral and physiological irregularities during sleep. Other mental health-related sleep disorders involve sleep disturbances stemming from Axis I or Axis II disorders.\n\nFocusing on the biological model, research has identified neurons in the hypothalamus, specifically those containing orexin, as crucial for regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice revealed the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons, which are responsible for sleep-wake states. The activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while inhibition leads to reduced anxiety and improved sleep quality. The use of a GABAB agonist, baclofen, was found to increase sleep duration, implying a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. This study's findings have significant implications, suggesting that a problem or absence of this receptor could impair an individual's ability to sleep without medication, negatively impacting daily life and productivity, including tasks that require focus and concentration.",
            "This paper delves into three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Firstly, it offers a concise definition of the condition. Secondly, it explains the diagnostic process, highlighting common characteristics or warning signs. Lastly, it discusses ways in which a teacher in a mainstream classroom can support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to the brain's ability to effectively utilize auditory information. In essence, it is a condition where the central nervous system struggles to process sounds, despite the ability to hear normally. Unlike hearing impairments, individuals with CAPD are not deaf, but their brains have difficulty interpreting and distinguishing between sounds, separating words from background noise, and differentiating between various conversations.\n\nThe earliest recorded mention of CAPD dates back to the 1950s, when researchers identified \"auditory imperception\" as a relevant area of study in children with communication disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari developed tests for these children in 1954, and in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the physiological workings of the brain during dichotic perception. A national conference in 1977 sparked further research into CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways, including difficulties in localizing sounds, distinguishing between multiple sounds, recognizing sound patterns, and detecting changes in speech, such as sarcasm. Additionally, individuals with CAPD may struggle to focus on specific sounds amidst background noise, synthesize sound clues, and determine the sequence of auditory information. \n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a comprehensive evaluation is conducted using systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests. This can be carried out by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals using a range of measures that assess auditory-related skills. The evaluation may include questionnaires, surveys, and observation of auditory behaviors in response to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single, consistently effective diagnostic tool, and the underlying cause of CAPD remains unknown. Diagnostic tests often present multiple auditory stimuli simultaneously and ask the individual to identify specific items, such as words or numbers. More advanced assessments involve recording and measuring the brain's response to acoustic signals within the ear.",
            "The play Twelfth Night appears to convey that while disguises can be used to deceive others for an extended period, ultimately, a person must discard their disguise to avoid losing themselves in the process. However, abandoning deception can lead to feelings of isolation, as one may be disconnected from those around them. As a result, individuals must weigh their own self-preservation against the preservation of their relationships. Although reactions to being deceived can vary, some may react neutrally, while others will be offended by the deception. This is particularly problematic when it involves gender role reversal, as it raises questions about the underlying motivations for adopting a disguise. \n\nIn the case of Viola, her decision to disguise herself as a man is driven by self-protection, as reflected in her words: \"I'll take you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). Initially, her plan is successful in protecting her, but it also creates a distance between her and the women around her, leaving her without a support system. Furthermore, her disguise is so convincing that it leads to confusion, as Olivia mistakenly falls in love with her. Viola also has to navigate her unrequited love for Orsino, as well as suppressed romantic desires: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love a woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nFrom a modern perspective, Twelfth Night may be seen as an example of how deception can facilitate the exposure of repressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that these characters may have unconscious desires that are forced to the surface by Viola's disguise. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because of his appearance as a man, or does she genuinely harbor feelings for women? Although it is likely that Olivia is not attracted to women, her character may be satirizing the tendency of people to judge others based on appearance. This is evident in her swift transition from loving Cesario to regarding him as a family member: \"A sister, you are she\" (5.1.315).",
            "German colonial rule was characterized by varying degrees of brutality, particularly in relation to the atrocities committed against the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. The diversity of the German colonial empire, encompassing different policies, ruling styles, and geographical areas, complicates a simplistic analysis. Educational systems across the colonies also showed significant variations. When the British took over German East Africa (now Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large, educated, and literate African population, a result of German educational efforts. Conversely, German educational initiatives in Kamerun and other colonies received praise from contemporary writers. \n\nHowever, German South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast. Unlike in East Africa, where the government invested in state schools and played a significant role in native education, in South West Africa the responsibility was largely left to missionary societies with limited government support. Yet, the government invested substantial resources in educating Europeans in the colony, establishing a system of state schools and heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. This disparity in educational policies would have lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. In stark contrast to other German colonies, where a significant number of Africans were literate and educated, 'the overwhelming majority of the population in South West Africa remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.' Various factors contributed to this divergent experience, including social, political, and economic considerations.\n\nThis paper aims to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and focusing on recent research into the views of settlers and colonial authorities on native Africans. A substantial body of literature exists on education within the German colonial empire, primarily in German and written in the early 20th century. Early works mainly focused on describing the educational systems in these colonies, while later English-language writings expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education across the various German colonies and more in-depth analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant differences in educational systems across the various colonies. Cohen's study, which compared the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa and highlighted the factors contributing to the differences between them, is a prominent example of this work. According to Cohen, the significant settler population in South West Africa is a major factor in the distinguishing characteristics of the colony's educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, despite being largely covered by arid desert. This favorable climate contributed to a relatively large European population in South West Africa. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, significantly more than the approximately 5,336 settlers in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population.",
            "Over the past 100 years, the classification of popular music has become increasingly complex due to the numerous genres that have emerged. Many of these genres, such as rock, country, jazz, and folk, have branched out into multiple sub-genres, making it challenging to create a definitive list. One genre that has exploded with diversity is heavy metal rock, which has become one of the most expressive and dynamic genres in popular music over the past 40 years. Characterized by its ability to convey a wide range of emotions, heavy metal tends to focus on the darker side of the emotional spectrum. This genre's versatility has led to the creation of numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, resulting in a vast array of styles within the heavy metal movement.\n\nToday, the heavy metal genre has become so diverse and niche-specific that it can be difficult to pinpoint its exact definition. The genre has incorporated elements from other genres while still maintaining its unique identity. To understand the vast array of metal music that exists today, it is essential to grasp the origins and evolution of the heavy metal movement.\n\nAt its core, the heavy metal movement is defined by its association with darkness, which is reflected in its music, often characterized by its greater emphasis on bass, volume, and theatricality. Heavy metal music is also marked by its technical complexity, with musicians showcasing their exceptional skill and musicianship. Additionally, the genre has a history of being linked to the use of psychedelic drugs, particularly during the 1970s, which influenced the creation of some of its most iconic and experimental records. The genre's dark, visceral qualities were a departure from the more lighthearted and mainstream music that dominated the music scene at the time. Later generations of metal musicians drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's emphasis on the darker aspects of human emotion. Examples of lyrics, such as those found in Helter Skelter by the Beatles, demonstrate the genre's affinity for exploring the darker side of human experience. This song, often cited as one of the first heavy metal songs, was a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier and darker style, showcasing the Beatles' ability to create music that was equally intense and heavy.",
            "Well before the Surrealist movement took shape, Henri Rousseau was working tirelessly to bring his dreams to life, both literally and figuratively. His 1910 painting, The Dream, captures not only the wonder of a woman as she explores a mystical land within her dreams but also Rousseau's own aspirations as an artist. Throughout his career, he longed for recognition, acclaim, and admiration from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, but this aspiration came with an inner conflict. Rousseau had to decide whether to conform to established artistic styles to gain acceptance from the art world he admired or maintain his creative independence and forge his own path.\n\nTo fully understand the significance of The Dream, one must first delve into Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the French town of Laval, he was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle. Despite having no formal art training, Rousseau worked as a municipal toll service employee until the age of 40, earning the nickname 'douanier,' or customs inspector. His life took a significant turn after the death of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children, leaving him with a daughter, Julia, and immense sadness. To find solace and a fresh start, Rousseau turned to painting. Unlike his contemporaries who often romanticized and idealized peasants in their work, Rousseau's paintings reflected his humble background and the hopes and fears of the average person from his social class.\n\nRousseau's desire for acceptance by the art world is understandable given his circumstances. He began his artistic career at an older age, with no formal education in painting, and was producing works alongside many other talented and well-known modern artists. It wasn't until around the same time that Matisse started gaining recognition as an artist that Rousseau received proper recognition for his art. According to author Jan Gordon in his book Modern French Painters, Rousseau and Matisse were distinct not only in their style and subject matter but also in their motivations for creating art. While Matisse sought to avoid painting in a predictable way, Rousseau aimed to create conventional works that would earn him acceptance by the Artiste Français.",
            "The idea that ethics and aesthetics are interconnected has been a concept explored by many influential thinkers. I agree that there's a fundamental basis for this connection. John Keats' famous quote from \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know,\" highlights the notion that truth and beauty are deeply intertwined. While our understanding of the world is often acquired through education and experience, we don't learn to appreciate ethics and aesthetics in the same way. Both ethics and aesthetics are descriptive, rather than prescriptive, and our studies of morality and beauty aim to explain why something is beautiful or moral, rather than provide a set of rules for creating or assessing it.\n\nIn fact, it's challenging to fully capture the essence of what makes something good or beautiful through criticism. Discussions about the value of a work of art, like the Mona Lisa, may focus on technical aspects such as composition, contrast, or cultural context, but these elements don't fully convey why it's considered a masterpiece. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often respond with phrases like \"There's just something about it,\" which hints at a deeper, more complex understanding. Both art and morals seem to possess an intangible quality that cannot be reduced to a detailed description. This is echoed in the words of Flannery O'Connor, who said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, ethics has this same transcendent quality, as Ludwig Wittgenstein noted, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\"\n\nThis transcendent nature of both ethics and aesthetics serves as a common thread between them. Furthermore, both morality and art have a profound impact on us at a level that cannot be fully explained, a phenomenon described as \"noumenal\" in philosophical terms. This connection is particularly strong when it comes to literature, as it uniquely combines art and moral quality. As pointed out by McKean, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about it, is its moral quality.\" Literature, like life itself, inherently involves values, making it a vital source of moral guidance and inspiration.",
            "Germany is a unified nation with its unique cultural identity spanning from the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea in Kiel, and from the Rhine River in Cologne to the Elbe River in Dresden. This diverse culture is shaped by its complex history, which is influenced by various tribes and sources. The origin of the name \"Germany\" is a topic of ongoing debate among scholars and historians.\n\nSome believe that the name \"Germany\" originated from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, as suggested by the Roman historian Tacitus. According to Tacitus, the Romans adopted the term \"Germanus\" from the Gauls, using it to distinguish between the Gauls they had conquered and the Germanic tribes they had not. However, the Gauls themselves may have derived the term from a local word, possibly referring to a neighbor or a geographical location. Julius Caesar used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, describing the Germans as a formidable force that frequently clashed with the Gauls.\n\nAnother theory suggests that the name \"Germany\" is derived from the word \"ger,\" an Old English term for spear, or from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout\" or \"loud,\" implying that the Germans were a vocal and assertive people. The Roman historian Tacitus wrote in his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" that the Germans were an indigenous people, untainted by immigration or cultural exchange with other civilizations. However, the Romans did have contact with the Germanic tribes, who lived on the borders of the empire and engaged in trade and military service with the Romans.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes emerged in the 1st century AD, they interacted with the Roman Empire, trading goods and skills, and serving in the Roman army. While the Romans maintained their dominance over the empire, they also acknowledged the Germanic tribes as a significant force, with Tacitus describing them as a people of strong character and distinct culture.",
            "My gaze fell downwards, and my mind was consumed by the scene in front of me, yet I couldn't process it emotionally.  I observed it with a detached mindset, unable to link the object of my gaze to any deeper understanding.  Thoughts flashed in my mind, only to quickly disappear, leaving me with a sense of disconnection from my own thoughts.  My consciousness functioned smoothly, allowing me to experience the scene unfolding before me without any personal interpretation.\n\nThe memory of an art instructor's advice led me to purchase \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" a book that aimed to teach drawing techniques.  Having been fascinated with drawing since childhood, this book provided a comprehensive guide, covering even the basics, such as understanding the properties of a pencil and the brain's processes for interpreting lines.  One of the techniques the book recommended was to place a frame around the subject to be drawn, simplifying complex scenes and allowing for a clearer understanding of the composition.  However, at that moment, I found it difficult to mentally apply this concept to the scene before me – a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen – as I was overwhelmed by its complexity.\n\nAs I stood there, lost in the beauty of the scene, I couldn't help but think of famous artists like Picasso, Monet, and the masters of the Italian Renaissance, each with their unique style and color palette.  If I wanted to create something worthy of being called art, then this was the starting point, the beginning of my artistic journey, titled \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingers instinctively reached for the pencil, my hand tensed and relaxed as I prepared to create.  However, my action was interrupted by a sudden urge, and I found myself gripping the toilet handle, my muscles tensing with each attempt to dislodge the stubborn brown mass.  The toilet refused to cooperate, and my hand slapped against the handle in frustration.  Holding a mop, wearing a green tie that felt constricting, and gazing at the unappealing waste left behind by someone else, I felt a mix of emotions.  After a few more flushes, I took a deep breath, stood up straight, and with a sense of resolve, I grasped the toilet paper and wrapped my hand around it, creating a makeshift mitten.  With a newfound determination, I leaned forward, my hand slowly entering the bowl, as if I was preparing to retrieve something precious.",
            "The alarming number of teenager fatalities on the road is largely due to a combination of factors that are uniquely tied to this age group.  According to the National Institutes of Health, one key reason stems from the fact that the teenage brain is not fully equipped to handle the dangers associated with driving.  Additionally, inexperience plays a significant role, not only in increasing the likelihood of fatal accidents but also in contributing to higher rates of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and off-road incidents.\n\nIt is also evident that teenagers are more prone to accidents when they drive with their peers, which is a common occurrence.  A study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a correlation between the age of passengers and the number of traffic accidents that occur.  Various states, including California, have attempted to mitigate this issue by introducing temporary provisional licenses, which restrict the driving hours of teens and prohibit them from transporting other minors.\n\nHowever, these measures, in my opinion, are merely temporary solutions.  The fundamental issue lies in the fact that, as a group, the youngest drivers lack the capacity to adequately manage the risks and responsibilities associated with driving.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman suggests that 18 is still too young for a regular driver's license, citing his research on the common desire among those under 19-20 to engage in thrill-seeking behavior.  Given this, it makes sense to delay driving privileges until this tendency has diminished.  If we persist in issuing driver's licenses to young teens, we can expect to see a continuous rise in fatal accidents, with potentially catastrophic consequences in the coming years.  By 2010, the Baby Boomer generation's children will be reaching driving age, and millions of new teen drivers will be hitting the roads.\n\nTo address this issue, legislation that restricts driving to those 18 and above could be implemented.  Schools could continue to provide driver's education classes to facilitate the learning process, while provisional permits could still be issued prior to a full driver's license.  The required hours of practical driver's training could be based on the existing standards in the majority of states, such as California's requirement of 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice.  Given that the statistics on teen driver fatalities are consistent across the country, a uniform national law addressing this issue would be a sensible and effective means of protecting young drivers nationwide.\n\nThis proposed legislation is not a novel concept, but rather a well-reasoned and necessary step towards reducing the risk of teenage driver fatalities.",
            "Upon examining the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I decided to view all 15 trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films primarily relied on creative editing to create illusions. My analysis focused on analyzing the artistic aspects of trick films and identifying the unique characteristics of some of the later films. Early trick films were generally shot on a static set within a frontal proscenium framework, using long and medium shots, and adhering to the convention of one shot per film. However, some early 20th-century films experimented with this approach by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne common trait among trick films is the use of an interior set within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remained stationary, not moving to follow characters or objects. This technique was inspired by theatrical and vaudeville performances, where magic and illusions were common. A notable limitation of this method is that characters' movements were restricted to side-to-side movements, with no ability to move towards or away from the camera. \n\nFor instance, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from one side and move horizontally within the frame. Even when they exit the frame, the camera does not follow them. The frontal proscenium style often resulted in long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-up shots were not used in any of the Edison catalog trick films, as this format was inherited from the theatre and vaudeville traditions, where the audience could see the entire performance within a framed stage. As in early cinema, actors rarely moved towards the camera, making close-ups impossible.\n\nMost early trick films adhered to the convention of one conceptual shot per film, restricting their length to around a minute or less, depending on the frame rate used. This limitation also restricted the narrative and dramatic potential of trick films, which primarily focused on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing acts, and quick changes. However, in trick films, a single conceptual shot might be composed of multiple physical shots, used to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. In the film The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), for example, a closer examination reveals the point where the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the whole film is perceived as one shot.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early advocate for Republicanism, and his profession as an agriculturalist, along with his brief foray into politics, made him known for his unwavering commitment to individual freedom and limited government. His agrarian views served as the foundation for his opinions on governance, as he sought to protect and promote this occupation as the most superior career. This perspective influenced his perspectives on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judicial system, as he aimed to preserve the integrity of what he considered the ideal profession.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a unique opportunity to establish an ideal system of government, free from the constraints of native traditions that might have hindered its development. He firmly believed in the inherent rights of individuals, which are interconnected and interdependent, and that compromising one right would undermine the value of the remaining ones. Consequently, he argued that these rights should be beyond the reach of the government. He saw the concept of the \"state of nature\" as an era where the strong and cunning profited, but in a civilized society, this should not be the case.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor believed that a government must be designed to account for the dual nature of human beings, comprising both good and evil. He adhered to a rigid dualistic morality and contended that a government, being run by humans, would inevitably reflect both its virtues and vices. He defined good principles as those that protect private property, promote agriculture, and discourage capitalism, and believed that a government founded on these principles would function fairly, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by self-interest and avarice. However, he distinguished between self-interest as a motivation for creating a society for the public good and its manifestation as a destructive force that exploits others. A good government was essential to contain humanity's inherent evil, and it must be closely monitored to prevent the introduction of bad principles.\n\nLike many other Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution, limiting the federal government to only the powers explicitly stated in the document. He recognized that an extensive federal government would be costly and prone to despotism, but also believed that a literal interpretation without considering the intent of the Founding Fathers could be hazardous. Moreover, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more explicitly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Analyzing the data in Figure 17, we observed a significant decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project, which was disappointing to note. It's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause for this drop. The onset of winter could have led to a decrease in cycling and walking commutes, and the end of the fall semester might have left some people too busy with schoolwork and end-of-semester tasks to participate. Additionally, the holiday season's timing coincided with the month-long winter break for students and faculty, which likely reduced the need for commuting. The resumption of classes in late January might have also contributed to the low log submissions for that month. Given this context, it's puzzling that the low submission numbers persisted into February. It's possible that the project experienced an initial surge in interest that naturally waned over time, as seen in many similar initiatives. To counteract this decline, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week, a special promotional campaign in March that led to an increase in log submissions. However, we faced challenges in sustaining project momentum, particularly due to the natural decrease in engagement and the impact of holiday and semester breaks on academic settings. Another hurdle in promoting alternative commuting modes is the entrenched cultural preference for driving personal vehicles, which offers a sense of freedom and independence. To encourage participation, we offered prizes in the form of gift certificates to local businesses, but it would have been intriguing to explore the effect of larger, more substantial prizes, such as bicycles or eco-friendly cars. Offering escalating prizes throughout the project might have helped maintain interest, as the initial incentive of gift cards seemed to wane over time. If we had announced more substantial prizes in December and January, participation might have increased instead of decreasing.",
            "An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that mirrors the performance of a specific index, commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund, but offers greater flexibility and trades on a stock exchange like a stock.  ETFs provide the diversification benefits of an index fund and the advantages of individual stock ownership, such as the ability to short sell, buy on margin, and purchase a single share.  While these benefits are highly appealing, the expense ratios of ETFs are lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, there are some drawbacks, including the need to pay a commission for each trade involving ETFs, just like with stock transactions.  One of the significant advantages of ETFs is the wide range of available funds. It is essential for savvy investors to critically evaluate the benefits of ETFs, such as diversification, to determine if they truly exist and to what extent.  In this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to assess whether the benefits of owning a single ETF are comparable to those of a diversified portfolio of the 10 stocks and whether there are alternative configurations that could provide a more optimal risk-adjusted return.\n\nTo simplify the evaluation, we have chosen to focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Below is a list of the top 10 holdings and their respective percentages of total assets.\n\nTo gauge how well the top 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current asset percentages to calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's beta and return if the portfolio consisted entirely of these 10 stocks, in the same proportion as the ETF's holdings. The beta and return calculations are presented in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, it is clear that a portfolio consisting of only the top 10 holdings would generate a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns. It is also evident that the beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. Our preliminary findings suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings may offer higher returns with lower risk. However, there is a possibility that the differences between the two portfolios may not be statistically significant.\n\nTo determine whether these portfolios are statistically different, we calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considers \"Dream-Land\" to be one of his standout poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" twice, which Mabbott attributes to Virgil's work. However, it is unclear if Virgil was the primary source, as Poe was heavily influenced by German literature, particularly the works of Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was a renowned poet who wrote the famous play \"Faust,\" which includes a poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells the story of a king who, after his wife's death, becomes consumed by grief and turns to excessive drinking. The king's descent into despair serves as a poignant parallel to the speaker's experience in \"Dream-Land,\" where he describes a dark and lonely world devoid of color.\n\nInterestingly, Goethe's poem \"The King of Thulé\" bears a striking resemblance to \"Dream-Land.\" In both works, the protagonist grapples with the loss of a loved one and finds solace in drinking. It is possible that Poe was drawing inspiration from Goethe's work. Furthermore, Goethe's influence can be seen in the fact that Poe references Thule twice in his collected writings, once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and again at the beginning and end of \"Dream-Land.\" This repetition suggests that the two poems are companion pieces, with \"Dream-Land\" serving as a dark reflection of \"The King of Thulé.\"\n\nConsidering Goethe's significant impact on the literary world, it is likely that Poe would have been familiar with his work. As a testament to Goethe's reputation, Poe expressed his admiration for Tennyson, indicating that he held Goethe in high esteem. Additionally, the many reproductions of Goethe's works that were published after its initial release would have also exposed Poe to his writing.",
            "Under California law, a customer who suffered an injury after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill at a grocery store may be eligible for punitive damages if it can be proven that the store manager acted with malice, defined as a deliberate disregard for the potential harm that could result from their actions. A court is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages at this stage. To be entitled to punitive damages, Palmer must provide evidence that the store manager's actions were taken with a deliberate and conscious disregard for the potential harm that could occur, as well as proof that the actions were despicable. Palmer can argue that the store manager should have realized the potential harm of not cleaning the spill, given that several customers had previously slipped and fallen in the store before her accident, and despite this knowledge, the manager still failed to clean the spill. Although Palmer's argument that the manager's actions were despicable is not strong, it remains valid given the frequency of slip-and-fall incidents at the store, with six incidents reported in 2009 and the manager failing to take adequate measures to ensure the safety of customers.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee informed the store manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle, but Martin responded that he was on a break and did not have time to deal with customer complaints. Fifteen minutes later, another employee reported the spill, and Martin gave the same response. At 5:30 pm, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, suffering a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at the store in 2009. Palmer is now suing the store for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion to dismiss the punitive damage claim.\n\nUnder California law, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation that is not related to a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, where the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of their actions and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.",
            "It has been almost four years since I took a course on Islam at CBC, which sparked a heated debate in class about whether Islam is inherently hostile.  I believe this question remains more relevant now than ever, especially considering the shift in media's portrayal of Islam and extremists since the events of 9/11.  Looking back, it's remarkable that in 2001, a presidential candidate like Barack Obama with a Muslim background would have been unimaginable. \n\nThe life of the Prophet, as I've learned from its biography, presents a contradictory image of Muhammad, one that diverges from the conventional understanding of his character.  I had previously believed that Muhammad was a forceful leader who coerced people into converting to Islam, but the biography portrays him as a humble figure who was misunderstood and was humbled by others.  As a result, people gradually came to appreciate the truth in his teachings and sought him out. \n\nThere are intriguing parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the accounts of Muhammad's miracles, with one notable instance being the occasion when he multiplied food and drink to feed a group of forty men.  The narrative style employed in the biography creates an image of Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, but instead lived a life of truth and performed miracles.  This portrayal weakens the significance of Jesus Christ's life and miracles, much like a comparison between the two figures.  It is almost as if the authors are attributing the essence of Jesus' life to Muhammad. \n\nThe biography also includes numerous stories that seem to be designed to demonstrate how people independently converted to Islam, but many of these accounts rely on second-hand or even third-hand retellings.  This approach not only diminishes the credibility of the stories but also raises suspicions. \n\nWhat bothers me most about this biography is its attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure who embodies humility, compassion, and wisdom.  However, historical records contradict this image, and I find it puzzling that Muslims today may not be aware of the true circumstances surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus were quickly left behind in the development of Christian thought after his time.  If we look at the history of Christianity in broad terms, we notice a pattern of the faith drifting further and further away from its origins.  Presently, we are witnessing an increased awareness and a growing trend of progress.  Traditional followers may resist any ideas that stray from the teachings they were taught, but their influence may not be significant enough to impact the entire community.  As time passes, Christians will become increasingly aware of their history, and a desire will arise to distinguish between the original intent of Jesus' message and the additional doctrines that have been incorporated into the religion over time.  This process may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome is inevitable:  A reversal of the trend in Christian history will occur, and the faith will return to its original form.  A movement will emerge that will gradually strip away layers of doctrine, much like time moving backward, leaving only the fundamental principles that Jesus introduced, untainted by later interpretations.  When this shift takes hold in the United States and Europe, it will bring about a renewed focus on Jesus' original message, and people will come together to worship in a manner true to his teachings.  The church as an institution will still maintain its strength, guiding the way forward, but the diversity of Christian denominations will give way to increasing uniformity of belief and practice.  We will see a decrease in differences between regions, denominations, and divisions, and an increase in similarities.  History is replete with examples of reversals, such as the transformation of the Roman Empire from a persecutor of Christians to a Christian institution.  Our country has also experienced a similar transformation, evolving from a time of African-American slavery to a period of African-American leadership.  The future holds a similar reversion for Christianity, as it seeks to return to its roots and undo the diversity that has developed over time.  This process will be facilitated by a shift in how Jesus' words are interpreted, from being seen as literal statements to being understood as metaphors.  To understand what has transpired since Jesus' lifetime, we must look back to the early history of Judaism, which served as the foundation for the Christian faith.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the concept of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were already at the heart of the Jewish faith.  The Jewish population was not unified, instead being divided into groups such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people.",
            "I firmly believe that The Jungle reveals the inherent selfishness and self-centered nature of humans. As individuals, people prioritise their own interests over others, striving for personal gain and comfort, regardless of the consequences for those around them. The novel portrays this self-absorption through various examples, particularly in the actions of the factory owners and managers. Driven solely by a desire for expansion and profit, they disregard the well-being of employees, the environment, and even their own workers' safety. Upton Sinclair's vivid descriptions, such as the image of \"the line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky,\" illustrate the devastating impact of pollution caused by these factories. He highlights the owners' callous disregard for those affected by their operations, including the pollution produced by their factories and the unsanitary conditions in the surrounding areas.\n\nThe book also sheds light on the exploitative nature of the owners towards their employees. They show no qualms about sacrificing their workers' welfare in pursuit of profit, as evident from Sinclair's statement that \"there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The employees were forced to work in grueling conditions and were laid off at will, without any support or compensation. During the time period depicted in the novel, the lack of protective laws and regulations enabled the owners to exploit their employees, pushing them to work at an exhausting pace in hazardous conditions. The workers, who lived and worked in Packingtown, were essentially expected to endure these harsh circumstances without any assistance or support. The absence of organisations to provide aid and information to workers, and the shortcomings of unions that profited from their suffering, left them with no escape from the oppressive system. The novel ultimately portrays the workers as being treated like slaves, forced to survive on the whims of their exploiters, and as a result, immorality and desperation became rampant in the community.",
            "Many authors employ various literary techniques to evoke specific emotions or attitudes in their readers. Some methods are more effective than others. In his novel The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes a range of these techniques to create a particular atmosphere. One technique he frequently uses is combining adjectives with nouns in unexpected ways to convey a certain image. Another technique is assigning symbolic meaning to objects and using them to convey a particular message. Fitzgerald applies this latter technique to several colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, he establishes associations for white/gray and red/pink and then leverages these associations to evoke a particular feeling or idea in the reader when describing significant objects.\n\nFitzgerald creates associations for the colors white and gray, with white representing something finer and more refined, while gray symbolizes something older and faded. He establishes these meanings early in the novel by consistently using both colors. For instance, Daisy and Jordan are frequently described wearing white, and others, such as Nick and Tom, also wear white attire. The only time people are not dressed in white is when Nick is describing Gatsby's party, which is \"gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald further defines these colors by associating them with everyday objects and common subjects, such as when Nick goes to work and sees \"white chasms\" in New York City or when the names of people at Gatsby's party are listed as \"gray\" on Nick's schedule. He also describes ordinary people and places as white or gray, like Jordan and Daisy's \"white girlhood\" or the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes.\n\nOnce Fitzgerald establishes these meanings, he uses white and gray to convey the idea that certain subjects are unimportant or mundane. This approach begins with Daisy. After a period of time without using these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as wearing white in a car, which makes her appear less as a distinct character and more as a uniform element that Gatsby desires. He employs this technique with Daisy multiple times to create this image of her being a uniform addition. For example, there is a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and she is again dressed in white before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County has a thriving agricultural sector, primarily due to its pleasant and sunny climate. Local farmers cultivate a variety of crops such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a significant demand for organic community-supported agriculture in the area, with numerous local organizations facing lengthy waiting lists for their produce, including organic eggs and milk. Many organic farms offer guided tours of their operations, allowing visitors to engage in outdoor activities like hiking and birdwatching. This type of farming model enables landowners to participate in government programs, conserve the environment, and create opportunities for recreational activities and educational programs while generating revenue.\n\nIn addition to capitalizing on a lucrative market niche, organic farming has several benefits, including increased biodiversity in the area, thanks to the absence of chemical use in the soil and water. However, organic farming often incurs higher costs compared to conventional methods, requiring more labor and management to control pests and weeds without chemicals, and potentially resulting in greater losses. Small-scale organic farms also face challenges related to efficiency and scale, especially when compared to larger operations. Furthermore, practices beneficial to wildlife, such as planting cover crops and removing invasive species, can also be labor-intensive. These factors highlight the need for landowners to seek financial assistance or expertise in optimizing both profitability and environmental quality.\n\nThe chosen property, located near the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California, is a 160-acre parcel featuring chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This area falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which aims to protect over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nThis land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 19th century. The property was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and wood production for many years. To better understand the viable options for a small farmer in this area, a search of real estate websites and government programs was conducted. A comparable organic farm in the same region was identified as a model for potential operations.",
            "Effective negotiation relies heavily on understanding the nuances of culture, which cannot be defined by a single, fixed identity. Rather, it encompasses a complex web of what it signifies and what it's not. It's essential to recognize that cultures are diverse, multifaceted, and not limited to national or geographical boundaries. A culture's generalizations, such as labeling an entire nation as stubborn or accommodating, are overly simplistic and lack depth. To be productive in negotiation, one must consider the significance of a culture to the specific situation at hand and how its attitudes will influence the negotiation process.\n\nWhen interacting with a foreign culture, we tend to draw comparisons to our own, which can lead to oversimplification. A more effective approach is to accept and respect the culture for what it is, rather than trying to change or judge it. This is particularly crucial when negotiating with a weaker bargaining position. Recognizing and respecting the traditions and beliefs of the opposing culture can help overcome cultural barriers and facilitate progress in the negotiation.\n\nFurthermore, corporate culture can be just as distinct as national culture, with its own set of values, norms, and practices. A company's culture can be observed in its dress code, communication style, delegation of tasks, and hiring practices. This diversity is evident within a nation, with variations between companies and even within the same company across different regions and environments. It's essential to look beyond the surface level and appreciate the complexity of a culture.\n\nUnderstanding the values that drive a culture is crucial, as they reveal the underlying motivations and priorities. For instance, if saving face or communal harmony is valued, a negotiator will avoid public embarrassment or conflict to achieve success. On the other hand, if a culture prioritizes hard-driving bargains, a negotiator may be more likely to push for a deal. Considering these cultural differences before the negotiation is vital, but it's equally important to gain a personal understanding of the opposing party to create a more effective negotiation strategy.",
            "The phrase, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" originates in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and serves as the foundation of St. Anselm's argument for the existence of God. Interestingly, Thomas Aquinas shares a similar perspective on this issue. Since both authors present arguments in favor of the same concept, we will assume, for the sake of clarity, that both believe in the existence of the God described in the Bible. Focusing on a different concept of God would hinder a fair comparison between their arguments. Although each author raises valid points, neither provides a comprehensive basis for believing in God.\n\nTo illustrate this, we will first examine St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm's reasoning suggests a path of understanding that involves looking inward to find evidence of God's existence within one's own mind. He proposes that since God is a concept that we can understand, we cannot conceive of a world without him. In essence, Anselm argues that the proof for God lies within our own consciousness, and that we don't need external evidence to confirm his existence. This idea is closely tied to the concept of faith, where one accepts truth without absolute empirical proof, which is a common theme in Christian texts.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas presents a vastly different perspective. He believes that the existence of God can be proven solely through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith altogether. This approach could be beneficial for Christian evangelism as it would allow new converts to be persuaded by logic rather than relying on their willingness to accept something unproven. Aquinas supports his argument with five logical arguments: those of change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. By demonstrating the logical necessity of God's existence, Aquinas essentially shows that the existence of God is a fundamental requirement for understanding the world. Analogously, if you're given a puzzle with missing pieces, you can logically infer the features and existence of the missing piece even if you can't see it.",
            "About 2,500 years ago, a prince who would later be known as the Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned worldly life and attained enlightenment, which led to the development of Buddhism. The most traditional form of this religion is Theravada Buddhism, which has undergone significant changes since the Buddha's time. This can be observed in the annual Water-cutting ceremony in Sri Lanka, a Theravada nation, where both monks and lay people participate. The ceremony holds spiritual significance even though the Buddha never taught about any such celebration. This shows the extent to which the Theravada Buddhist community has adapted its core principles over time, influenced by both internal and external factors, both positive and negative.\n\nTo better understand this discussion, it's essential to understand the following key terms: internal and external forces, and hostile and benign influences. An internal force refers to any change initiated by members of the Buddhist community, regardless of their monastic status. An external force, on the other hand, comes from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any influence that causes harm or intends to harm the community, stemming from a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force, while not malicious, may unintentionally harm or benefit the community.\n\nThe discussion begins by examining the fundamental principles of Theravada Buddhism. At its core, Buddhists seek refuge in the 'Triple Gem': the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka, a collection of three baskets containing Buddhist scriptures. These include the Sutta Pitaka (Suttas), Vinaya Pitaka (disciplinary rules), and Abhidhamma Pitaka (metaphysical concepts). Key metaphysical ideas in Buddhism include the concept of Anatta (no permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these principles is crucial to breaking free from the cycle of death and rebirth (Samsara). Along with Samsara, one can overcome the causes of suffering, which include lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), upon achieving enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for laypeople and monks, with five precepts for the former (do not kill, lie, steal, engage in immoral conduct, or take intoxicants) and more rules for the latter. The Four Noble Truths form the foundation of Buddhist doctrine: the existence of suffering, its cause (attachment), and the possibility of overcoming it.",
            "The United States and Mexico serve as a striking example of two nations that were embroiled in a long-standing rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893, as documented by Diehl and Goerts (2000, p. 145). A pivotal moment in this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States defeated Mexico and successfully annexed Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Apart from this significant conflict, numerous other clashes took place between the two nations, eventually subsiding just before the onset of World War I. The underlying causes of this rivalry were rooted in fundamental disagreements over issues such as religion, culture, and tradition, alongside divergent material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis scenario is reminiscent of many other nations that have a long-standing rivalry with a neighboring country. Shared borders often give rise to conflicting interests, ultimately contributing to the formation of rival positions between the nations. The United States and Mexico are not exceptional in this regard, as David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that they are among the few nations that have consistently presented long-lasting diplomatic challenges to the United States, particularly compared to other Latin American countries that have historically enjoyed good relations with the US.\n\nThe religious differences between the two nations played a significant role in exacerbating the rift, a phenomenon that has been observed in many historical conflicts. According to Sally Frahm (2001), Americans were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries, much like their opposition to fascism and communism in the 20th century (p. 86). The ideological tensions between the United States and Mexico were, in this case, primarily driven by differences in religious preferences, rather than political structures. This mistrust was largely inherited from the distrust between the English and Spanish, making it a major obstacle to establishing amicable relations between the two nations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identify 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States that occurred during the 57-year period of rivalry. The majority of these disputes involved territorial issues, including border raids and frontier problems, such as those caused by Mexican bandits and outlaws from American border towns. These issues persisted until both nations deployed military force to secure their borders (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry between the two nations began to subside as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States and eventually ceased as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the latter part of the 19th century (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly afflicted with a condition I had never known existed while working as a nurse. Growing up, I had chosen nursing as a profession due to its stability and security, which was something I lacked as a child. People consistently told me, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" Although my true ambitions were to be a scientist or journalist, I settled for nursing. Now, at 46 and single, I have exhausted my savings and am unable to work due to my ongoing disability. I've relied on Social Security Disability for 15 years and have nothing to call my own. Each day is a struggle to ensure my safety, security, and self-worth. However, I've come to realize that without the support of my family and a few close friends, I wouldn't have made it. \n\nMy experience has taught me that we can never truly be prepared for every life emergency, no matter how well we plan. I agree that we should reduce our reliance on the government, which is often unstable. Nevertheless, I believe it's more crucial for Americans to relearn the importance of helping one another and asking for assistance. This attitude is more essential than individual survival tactics like building personal shelters. \n\nThe idea of \"rugged individualism,\" often promoted by Conservatives, is a myth. In reality, it was the compassion and collective support of our ancestors that helped them overcome hardships. Pioneers who crossed the country didn't achieve their goals alone; they relied on each other for aid and resources.\n\nWhile being prepared is vital, it's equally essential to build connections with those around you. I have a disaster kit and supplies, but I also believe in getting to know my neighbors. If possible, having a small farm and being able to preserve food can be beneficial. Additionally, owning a wood stove can be useful, but it's only feasible for those living in rural areas.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in a particular way remains a complex and multifaceted issue, with various factors influencing the direction of evolutionary change. Although the foundations of evolutionary biology have been laid, the field still lacks a comprehensive mathematical framework to describe even the simplest organic forms. Recent advancements in mathematical modeling have been applied to the development and evolution of mollusk shells, considering both the growth of individual organisms (ontogeny) and the history of their species (phylogeny). Our study aims to combine mathematical modeling with experimental research to uncover the underlying mechanisms driving the pace and extent of evolutionary-developmental change in the Prunum species. By analyzing X-ray images of Prunum species, we have identified quantifiable parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell, allowing us to simulate diverse shell shapes and explore the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. Our results are being integrated with experimental and observational studies to gain a deeper understanding of the major evolutionary events within this group of organisms.\n\nA mollusk shell can be thought of as a spiral structure that grows over time, spanning 360 degrees of space. The spiral turns or whorls of a coiled shell are arranged around an imaginary central axis, known as the columella, which runs through the central column of the shell. The rate at which the whorls expand can vary, and the continuous line separating each whorl is called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the body whorl, while the spire consists of all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different perspectives, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. The conventional orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count the number of whorls, an individual shell should be viewed from the apical perspective. The first suture is identified, and a line is drawn to divide the shell into two parts. Whorls are then counted from this line, with each whorl estimated to a quarter of a turn.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a series of openings that evolve over time and space as the animal builds its shell. By tracing the path of the aperture, which can be defined by the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture, we can graphically and mathematically represent the shell's growth pattern. Once a mathematical model is established, we can manipulate parameters to simulate changes in the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Despite some stabilization in neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia over the past decade, the country is still facing significant challenges in meeting its Millennium Development Goals, particularly in the areas of child and maternal health.  While Indonesia is making progress in certain areas, such as water and sanitation, the country's improvements in healthcare are lagging behind the required pace to meet its 2015 targets.  This situation necessitates strengthening of the overall healthcare system rather than focusing solely on specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has achieved some positive milestones, including an increase in the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% of births meeting this target.  However, this statistic includes traditional workers like midwives who may not be equipped to handle complications, resulting in high maternal mortality rates due to factors such as hemorrhage.  This improvement appears somewhat misleading, highlighting the need for further action.  Additionally, there has been a decline in the percentage of children under five treated by a healthcare professional for diarrheal cases, and postnatal care data is incomplete, indicating a pressing concern in this area.\n\nRegarding cesarean-section rates, Indonesia's rates are lower than expected, at around 4%, and this disparity is particularly concerning given the significant gap in rates between urban and rural areas, with urban settings recording a 7% rate compared to a mere 2% in rural areas.  This underscores the issue of unequal access to healthcare services across the country, with urban areas receiving more attention.  Another issue is vertical equity, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, suggesting that the poor face significant barriers in accessing healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nIn determining the most effective approach to improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is how to address the lack of access to healthcare services.  The key consideration is whether Indonesia should adopt program-specific approaches or strengthen its overall healthcare system without focusing solely on pre- and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children.  While programmatic approaches have the advantage of being more targeted and yielding faster results, they also have drawbacks, such as diverting resources away from other areas of the health sector and creating duplication of services and inefficient use of resources.  These challenges highlight the need for a more comprehensive approach to healthcare reform in Indonesia.",
            "Victorian novels are characterized by their meticulous attention to detail and a focus on the social elite of the time.  Two notable exceptions to this trend are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which deviate from the norm by incorporating elements of mystery and the unusual. These unconventional features heighten the complexity of the characters within each novel, offering deeper insights into their motivations and emotions.\n\nThis unorthodox approach is often achieved through dream sequences or dreamlike states, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy blur. In Oliver Twist, these enigmatic events frequently shed light on Oliver's inner struggles, revealing the pains and fears that haunt him. The repeated depiction of Oliver's reliving of the shooting incident in chapter 28 serves to emphasize his lack of agency and control over his circumstances. The passage highlights Oliver's diminished capacity for action, as he is overwhelmed by his emotions and unable to intervene, even when his life is at stake. This sense of powerlessness is further underscored by the description of his hallucinations, which are a manifestation of his deep-seated despair and fear. The shooting sequence also raises questions about the nature of fate versus free will, as it is clear that Oliver's misfortune is not a result of his own actions, but rather a consequence of external forces beyond his control. Furthermore, this episode implies a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if he has been broken by his circumstances, leading to a diminished capacity for resistance and self-preservation.\n\nThe passage also alludes to the cyclical nature of time, where days blend together in a seemingly endless cycle of darkness and brief moments of consciousness. The night is portrayed as both interminable and fleeting, a symbol of the monotony and despair that pervades Oliver's life.",
            "It's been a while since I worked in an after-school program where I helped elementary school students with their studies. My areas of expertise were in English and reading, so I focused on assisting students with those subjects. I was approached by one of the instructors to work with a boy named Adrian, who struggled with reading. As I observed him, I realized that something was amiss - he had a peculiar reading pattern; he could pronounce some letters correctly while others were completely off. It was a peculiar observation, especially considering his background, which I believed to be Latino, and the fact that he spoke fluent English. I eventually met his mother, who only spoke Spanish, and through my limited Spanish skills, I learned that the issue wasn't a lack of reading abilities, but rather unfamiliarity with the English alphabet. This understanding led me to hope that some guidance might be helpful in addressing his struggles.\n\nI share this story to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, particularly in California. It's essential to recognize that even students who speak English fluently can face significant challenges with reading. I believe that everyone acknowledges this problem exists, so let's explore potential solutions. In Adrian's case, individualized English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation, seemed like a viable approach. However, for students with limited English proficiency, the solution is more complex and multifaceted. No single approach, such as dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, or ESL classes, will suffice on its own. A comprehensive strategy that integrates these methods is necessary.\n\nThe dual language system is a promising idea that benefits not only English language learners but all students. Research has shown that children in bilingual education programs tend to outperform their peers academically. Some may believe that these programs are a waste of resources or that the majority of students won't benefit, but this misconception can be addressed by implementing such programs on a larger scale. To make this work, we don't need to require all teachers to be bilingual, which would be impractical. Instead, we can provide bilingual support staff, tutors, or aides to supplement the existing teaching staff.",
            "From a young age, most of us are told that there is something greater than ourselves, a concept that transcends our understanding. Some people attend religious institutions like Sunday school, temple, or search within themselves for answers, while others may adopt the faith of their upbringing. However, a few individuals reject these beliefs, insisting that there is no truth beyond their own personal reality. Throughout life, people may change their values and spiritual perspectives as they seek meaning and purpose. This search for a guiding light can be a universal human quest. \n\nAs I spent time with my father on the porch, watching the rain, he revealed his love for cardinals. His distant expression hinted at a mix of contemplation and nostalgia. His appearance had changed due to illness, and he seemed to be avoiding eye contact. I felt a deep sense of loneliness and anxiety, unable to discuss my impending loss, as talking about it would make the reality even more unbearable. I turned to physical comfort by hugging him and sitting closer. I joined him in gazing out into the rain, trying to connect with him one last time.\n\nMy father passed away in December, just a few days after my 22nd birthday. The treatment prolonged his life, but it couldn't ease his suffering. I struggled to comprehend the value of prolonging his suffering. I questioned the existence of a benevolent God, wondering if he had stopped listening to me long ago. I chose not to watch his final moments, as it would have been too painful to witness the end of the person who brought me into this world. I preferred to remember him as he lived, not as he died. I knew my father would not have wanted me to be present during his passing, so I didn't attend. I locked myself in my room for three days, waiting for the news to arrive.\n\nThe painful absence of a phone call underscored my sense of isolation during that difficult time.",
            "Ian Watt describes the traditional Gothic Novel as a contradictory term that combines the concepts of \"old\" and \"new,\" as seen in his work \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel.\" The Gothic mode has been met with both criticism and praise, with some viewing it as lacking depth and others admiring its ability to evoke a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). The original Gothic Novel, \"The Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole, drew inspiration from both ancient and modern romance styles to create a new genre and literary expression. By combining old theatrical elements with modern novelistic techniques, Walpole presented what he called a \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre incorporates elements from medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated in comparison to modern societal and literary advancements.\n\nThe combination of the theatrical aspects of the Gothic style and the innovative format of the novel, which allows readers a more personal insight into character psychology, has contributed to the genre's enduring appeal and timeless quality. Despite being considered outdated, the Gothic genre remains relevant to readers from different eras, offering a unique blend of old and new.\n\nOne of the key ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of chivalry. The medieval notion of chivalry, which involves the training of a knight, is reinterpreted and reimagined in \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Chivalry is significant to Gothic writers because it represents an idealized image of a brave, honorable, and competent knight, which they perceived as lacking in their own society. By incorporating chivalric concepts and ideals, Gothic writers idealized and romanticized the past, foreshadowing the evolution of the genre into Romanticism. This nostalgia for a bygone era is also a commentary on the perceived moral decline of society, particularly during times of political turmoil. In the case of \"The Castle of Otranto,\" the character of Frederic embodies many chivalric traits, as evident in his description, which includes images of a gallant and courteous knight who has suffered and is now presumed dead. This portrayal exemplifies the Gothic trope of excess, which is a recurring theme in the genre.",
            "Supply chain management encompasses a series of interconnected processes that span from the initial customer order to the delivery of products. The concept of supply chain management was first introduced by Keith Oliver in 1982, a consultant who described the process of planning, implementing, and overseeing the supply chain to meet customer needs efficiently. The six core components of a supply chain are production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. By leveraging these elements, business managers can provide top-notch customer service.\n\nProduction is the foundational step in the supply chain process, involving the planning and execution of when, where, and how products will be created. To determine customer requirements, managers analyze market trends, which serve as a crucial indicator of customer demands. Once market analysis is complete, they decide what products to produce, in what quantities, and allocate the production to the most suitable facilities, considering factors like volume and quality to meet customer expectations. Effective production planning is critical, as any lapses can result in substantial time and financial losses.\n\nThe second crucial element in supply chain management is supply, which involves strategic decisions regarding a facility's core capabilities and partnerships. Companies may have multiple divisions for producing a single product, each with unique equipment, personnel, and expertise. Managers must determine the most suitable division for each process and consider outsourcing to other companies to enhance velocity, a concept that enables quality, flexibility, and cost reduction. By streamlining processes, companies can achieve success in the competitive market.",
            "Ellen Page holds a haunting sign on a street corner, claiming that Hitler is alive in Burma, also known as Myanmar. Burma is a Southeast Asian country under the control of a ruthless military junta that seized power in 1962 through a military coup. In 2007, a wave of public protests erupted, led by a large number of Burmese monks, earning the name \"The Saffron Revolution\" due to the color of their robes. As the protests gained momentum, the government initially permitted the monks to hold peaceful gatherings, but violence escalated into a brutal conflict between the military and the monks, with the military invading monasteries and detaining foreign journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist who was killed while covering a protest. The true extent of the violence is estimated to be much higher than reported, with credible sources suggesting that thousands of people had been killed.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident, for the suppression of dissent and authoritarian rule have been recurring themes throughout history. From ancient Roman emperors claiming divine right to rule to modern-day examples like the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, where China's government brutally cracked down on peaceful demonstrators, and the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups and the government systematically targeted Tutsis and moderate politicians, the desire for total control over the population has been a persistent phenomenon. The Nazi regime's systematic persecution of Jews during World War II is another harrowing example of this trend.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring legacy in jazz can be attributed to his notable longevity and exceptional creativity, particularly in his ability to lead his orchestra. While Ellington's piano presence is subtle in many of his compositions, as a composer, he excelled in crafting intricate and complex pieces that showcased the individual talents of his band members. By designing a framework for improvisation and writing tightly orchestrated arrangements, Ellington enabled soloists to shine while also emphasizing the unique sound of the entire ensemble. This mastery of individual player styles and their harmonious integration allowed him to create groundbreaking pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative approach to music, citing Creole Love Call, where he employed the human voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This piece exemplifies his practice of incorporating voice to add texture and depth without the constraints of lyrics, demonstrating his ability to complement the style of his soloists. A notable example of this is Creole Love Call, a slow twelve-bar blues with six distinct choruses that showcase Ellington's versatility. These choruses include:\n\n- Chorus 1: A call-and-response pattern between voice and reeds, starting with smooth and melodic vocals and transitioning to a rougher tone.\n- Chorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the melody and emphasizes extended blue notes.\n- Chorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n- Chorus 4: A full band echo of the first chorus, featuring a call-and-response between the brass and reed sections.\n- Chorus 5: The climactic chorus, where the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\n- Chorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call-and-response between voice and reeds, this time with the voice adopting a growl-like tone and soloing as an instrument.\n- A brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add tonal color to Creole Love Call illustrates a recurring stylistic trait in his work. His later piece, Hot and Bothered, showcases his skill at tight orchestration and sensitivity to tone color. In this work, Ellington combines his talents by pairing a call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing, blending the vocal aspects of Miley's playing and the instrumental qualities of Cox's voice. His piece It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends this concept by effectively utilizing Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "She had always felt an unfulfilled longing, a yearning that never seemed to be satisfied. This desire had been present since she was 14 and in the midst of her teenage years, and it persisted at 17. At this stage, she realized she was searching for a person rather than an object, but she found no interest in any of the boys who had shown interest in her. Some had attempted to win her over, but none had sparked her attraction. She frequently questioned herself about this unusual phenomenon, trying to identify the reason behind it. Over the years, various theories came to mind, but none were convincing enough to satisfy her curiosity. As a result, she continued to navigate life with unanswered questions about her desires.\n\nTypically, her home was a peaceful place, filled with her calm and composed parents. They rarely argued with each other, and disagreements with their daughter were extremely rare. The only time they disagreed was when she asserted her independence and individuality. As the daughter of a calm couple, she stood out with her lively and fun personality, making her endearing to those around her.\n\nHowever, today was not a typical day. While searching for inspiration, she heard her mother's anguished cry and the sound of her injured voice coming from the kitchen. Panicked, she rushed into the room, exclaiming, \"Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the ground, writhing in pain and repeatedly uttering \"Ow\" in short gasps. Her daughter immediately ran to her side and placed a hand on her to offer assistance. \"It hurts so much... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother stammered between gasps. The daughter could sense the severity of her mother's pain. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where I should pick you up,\" she replied. Her mother directed her, and the daughter was grateful for her physical training, as she carefully lifted her mother and carried her to the car, placing her in the backseat.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought the pungent smells of disinfectant and illness, mixed with an air of anxiety. But her daughter's focus was solely on her mother's well-being as she quickly entered the hospital and called for medical assistance. The medical staff rushed to her side, and someone swiftly wheeled a hospital bed over and helped her mother onto it. The doctors immediately began assessing her condition, leaving the daughter to sit anxiously in the waiting area. It turned out that her mother had fallen off a step stool while trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "The purpose of this study was to determine whether adherence to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet, a modified version of the Med diet, is characterized by higher consumption of plant-based foods, including plant proteins, monounsaturated fats, and fish, as well as lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is also permitted.\n\nPrevious studies have shown an inverse relationship between adherence to the Med diet and total and cardiovascular mortality, with one intervention trial demonstrating that the Med diet is more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, previous research did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study involved 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 without a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. Over six periods from 1984 to 2004, the researchers computed an aMed diet score from self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake over the past year. More than 95% of the nurses continued their participation throughout the 20-year study period. The FFQs underwent validation studies, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. If necessary, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions falling into this category. The researchers also calculated body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use for each FFQ, with leisure-time physical activity being assessed starting in 1986.\n\nTo minimize random variation and more accurately represent long-term dietary habits, the researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs (averaging scores from two prior years). They also made adjustments for potential confounders, including age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nTo analyze the relationship between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, the researchers used Cox proportional-hazard modeling with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nThe results showed that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, is associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 cases of CHD, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the top aMed quintile were found to be at a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The United States faced a severe economic downturn in 2007, characterized by a sharp increase in unemployment and a dramatic collapse of the housing market. This ongoing recession has led to questions about the causes of this crisis and how it can be prevented. In essence, the financial crisis was triggered by misguided and shortsighted policy decisions that pressured banks to issue high-risk sub-prime loans into an already fragile financial system. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two influential mortgage underwriters, were compelled to purchase and repackage these mortgages into complex financial instruments, which eventually became a liability when borrowers defaulted. The banks, lacking sufficient capital reserves, shifted the burden to the repackaged mortgages they had sold and, subsequently, to the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the crisis date back to 1999, when the Clinton administration's goal of securing a second term in office led to relaxed lending regulations. This move set the stage for the subsequent sub-prime crisis seven years later. As reported by Steven Holmes of the New York Times in 1999, Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, was under pressure from the Clinton administration and its shareholders to expand mortgage lending to low- and moderate-income individuals, potentially jeopardizing its financial stability. Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions, warning that the government-subsidized corporation might require a government bailout, akin to the savings and loan industry's rescue in the 1980s.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the proliferation of complex mortgage structures such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These financial instruments entwined various sectors of the economy with the housing market, leaving U.S. households and financial markets vulnerable to even minor fluctuations in property prices. The housing bubble eventually burst, exposing the financial institutions that had invested in these mortgage-backed securities to significant losses. By 2007, the top U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, representing approximately 30% of the U.S. GDP. As a result, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a discount, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to convert to commercial banks with strict regulatory oversight. Fannie and Freddie accumulated $5 trillion in mortgage debt, ultimately necessitating government intervention in September 2008.",
            "Exposition - the part of your story where you take to the skies, flaunting your writing skills, but often leaving your readers yawning or hitting the back button instead. Even seasoned writers like Dr. Merlin have been known to groan at the sight of too much unnecessary information, much to the dismay of their monitor.\n\nExposition is not a friend to writers. While many are familiar with the advice \"Show, don't tell,\" it's a rule that Dr. Merlin finds herself breaking all too often. She knows that exposition can be a snare, luring you into lengthy passages where little happens or worse, nothing of significance unfolds.\n\nAt its core, exposition is about telling the reader what's happened, often in a straightforward manner. It's akin to a character dumping a wealth of information on another in a film or the author doing the same in fiction. A common example of exposition is when a story tells the reader about a character's past, such as their childhood, marriage, or a pivotal event, without showing the essence of these experiences.\n\nConsider a scenario where a story reveals that the heroine met her spouse at a specific time and place, got married, and lost them tragically. You wouldn't expect this sequence to unfold over multiple pages without any meaningful character development. Instead, the author should delve deeper into the husband's character through their dialogue, mannerisms, and actions, allowing the reader to form a connection with them. This would also provide insight into the heroine's character, their relationship, and their emotional growth.\n\nA good story should offer more than just the bare bones of the plot: \"They met, they married, he died.\" As a writer, it's your job to add depth and complexity to these simple events. While it's tempting to rush through exposition, especially when introducing new characters, it's essential to resist this urge. For instance, instead of listing a character's entire life history, background, and interests, consider showing these aspects through their actions, dialogue, and interactions with others.",
            "I watched two breaking news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio on August 13, 2011. The first live news cast was from NBC 4 in the morning. The main story they covered was about a fatal stabbing incident in Ashley, Ohio, where a man named Shad Hostettler allegedly attacked his wife. Although his wife's name was not revealed, her husband's mug shot was displayed, which seemed menacing. The news team devoted around two minutes to this developing story, providing details that the victim had been stabbed multiple times and the perpetrator had been apprehended. I believe they allocated sufficient time for this story.\n\nThe subsequent story reported an early morning shooting incident involving 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured and there were no arrests or suspects at the time. The SWAT team was conducting an investigation. Notably, this story seemed to be brief, and I suspect it might have been due to the fact that the victim was a member of a minority group, as I have observed a pattern of underreporting of crimes involving minority victims. Typically, when a white individual is a victim of a crime, the media gives it extensive coverage, but minority victims often do not receive the same level of attention.\n\nThe news then shifted to a report about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. The details provided suggested the incident occurred in a specific location, and it was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle had hit the aircraft. Crime-Stoppers were offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe following story covered the weather forecast for the upcoming weekend, predicting rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to remain in the mid-to-low eighties. Although the segment was brief, it served as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nAnother story reported a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, approximately six feet tall, and weighing around 150 pounds. I found it striking that the news team emphasized the perpetrator's racial appearance and skin tone extensively.\n\nThe final story featured Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin who had been found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. What caught my attention was the way the news team presented his sentence – instead of stating 25 years in prison, they mentioned \"300 months.\" I am unsure if this was intended to make the sentence sound more severe or if there was another motive behind it. Additionally, the report noted that Rodriguez was a Hispanic man, which seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "A bond between brothers is a powerful and unbreakable connection that encompasses a wide range of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. This unique relationship allows brothers to deeply understand one another, often seeing themselves reflected in their sibling. The complexity of this bond becomes evident in times of crisis, when the true nature of their feelings – whether positive or negative – is revealed. As brothers navigate the consequences of these emotions, they gain insight into their own character through their actions and the outcomes that result from them.\n\nIn the novel \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers delve into the intricacies of this theme, accompanied by the intense emotions that come with it. Set against a vivid backdrop, the two boys embark on a doomed journey that pits bitter disappointment against intense pride in a climactic confrontation, ultimately leaving only one brother alive. The novel explores this theme through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with his brother, as well as the narrator's perspective, which conveys the complex feelings and worldview of the protagonist, both of which significantly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are primarily driven by one dominant emotion: pride. From their initial outings together to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist harbors a deep-seated resentment towards Doodle. His idealized vision of a brother who could share in his experiences and adventures is shattered by Doodle's fragile health, making it unlikely that he would ever be able to participate in physical activities. This crushing reality is compounded by the protagonist's own fantasies, which are slowly deflated as he comes to terms with Doodle's limitations. Although he contemplates harming his brother, the child's smile momentarily rekindles the protagonist's love and compassion, revealing a conflicted inner state. This internal conflict suggests that his initial thoughts were not firmly rooted, and that a deep-seated love for his brother ultimately prevails.",
            "The human brain is a highly intricate and creative system for processing information. Throughout the evolution of technology, the metaphors used to describe the brain have also evolved. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, followed by a sheet of papyrus, then a book, and more recently, a computer. However, it is crucial to remember that these metaphors have limitations and may lead to incorrect conclusions.\n\nThe process of information processing begins with the sensory organs converting physical stimuli into electrochemical signals. These signals are then repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing initially assembles basic information such as color, orientation, and the location of object borders to conclude that you are seeing a box. Subsequently, top-down processing utilizes the decisions made in the bottom-up process to expedite your recognition of the box, allowing you to identify it as a black box rather than a hole in the background.\n\nOnce information has been processed to a certain extent, an attention filter determines the signal's importance and which cognitive processes it should be made accessible to. This is evident in how your brain filters out individual blades of grass when you look down, yet you can focus on your name when spoken in a noisy environment. There are multiple stages of processing, with the results of processing modulated by attention at each stage.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it first needs to store it. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, with different types of encoding suitable for each type of sensory input. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on its structural appearance, phonetic sound, or semantic meaning. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Research on animals suggests that working memory, which retains information for approximately 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal looping through a specific series of neurons for a short duration. In contrast, long-term memory is hypothesized to be preserved in the structure of specific proteins.\n\nThere are numerous theories on how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on human subjects' memory retrieval, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that there are nodes representing concepts, which are connected based on their relationships. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which in turn can be associated with \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the looming threat of technology and its reinforcement by a capitalistic system in his dystopian novel, Brave New World. The novel portrays a society that prioritizes community over individuality, conditioning its citizens to pursue instant gratification above all else. However, beneath this façade, the citizens are mere pawns in a larger game controlled by the World Controller, who dictates a singular ideology. Analyzing the novel through the lens of Marxist theory reveals Huxley's underlying concerns about the development of these systems. The novel incorporates Marxist terminology, such as homogenization and reification, to highlight its commentary on the flaws of the emerging economy during Huxley's time.\n\nThe novel satirizes capitalism by illustrating the concept of false consciousness, where the common citizenry is kept ignorant of their true socioeconomic relationships. They are consumed by a desire for personal gain, a result of the ideological control exerted over the proletariat and working class, as seen in the conditioned people of Brave New World. The lower classes, represented by groups like Delta and Gamma, lack genuine autonomy, as their drive to consume and indulge is artificially strengthened through hypnopædia. This manipulation is orchestrated by the World Controller, exemplifying the concept of hegemony, where a dominant group exercises control over other social classes. The lower classes are oblivious to their manipulation, unwittingly accepting an ideology that perpetuates the capitalist structure. In contrast, the upper classes, represented by Alphas and Betas, are aware of their circumstances but often remain complacent, with few exceptions like Bernard.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between individuals are superficial, and the characters lack depth. This may suggest that the rise of technology and capitalism erodes human free will and self-expression. The novel's portrayal of interactions, often reduced to shallow comments about physical appearance, highlights the absence of genuine emotions and connections. Furthermore, the societal classes' acceptance of their positions in the hierarchy underscores the socioeconomic impact of capitalism, as they conform to their roles and obey the norms of their peers. This illustrates the Marxist concept of the proletariat, who are misled into believing in their own superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for almost three years, which is equivalent to five semesters. For many students, including myself, navigating the campus can be quite challenging. During my first year, I lived in East Halls, which is situated at the easternmost part of campus, excluding the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. The distance between my dorm in Stuart Hall and my classes in buildings like the Willard building, near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes to cover on foot, especially on bad weather days, which are frequent in State College. I spoke to a recent alumnus who shared with me that not long ago, East Halls was separated from the rest of the campus by a large empty area. This vacant space has since been developed with sports fields, new buildings such as the Creamery and the health services building, and surrounding apartments. As the campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another is becoming increasingly difficult. In a college setting, I firmly believe that the most effective solution to this mobility issue is to use bicycles. However, owning a bike alone is not enough; students must be willing to ride them, and the campus infrastructure needs to be designed with the needs of cyclists in mind.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who had recently taken up cycling again after a several-year hiatus. He expressed his surprise that he had stopped cycling in the first place, stating that \"cycling is the best way to get around.\" Besides being beneficial for one's physical health, cycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. Combining a nutritious meal, such as oatmeal, with moderate physical exertion can take you up to 30 miles or more. Like many of my fellow undergraduates, I now reside off-campus, which is just as far from the campus center as some dorms. My decision to purchase a bike has been one of the most practical choices I made this year. Every day, I attend classes in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. However, with my bike, I can reach the building in just 5 minutes if I pedal at a sufficient pace. The only drawback is that Pollock Road, which is the most direct route to Thomas building from my residence, is not always an easy road to navigate, whether by bike or on foot. While walking has its own advantages, I simply don't have the time for it. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would take me an additional 30-40 minutes each day to reach Thomas building. That's over two hours per week, which is a substantial time commitment. Considering the cumulative time spent walking to and from other classes, appointments, and other activities, it would be even more time-consuming. Given my schedule, I couldn't afford to spare that much time."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.

            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle.

Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1).

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "As I pursue a degree in social work, I aim to embark on a career path within the Division of Family and Children Services, where I can make a positive impact on the lives of children who have been abused or neglected, and provide support to families in need. My commitment to this field is driven by a set of core values, including a strong sense of service, respect for others, a commitment to upholding ethical standards, and a dedication to fostering healthy relationships between individuals. These values not only resonate with me professionally but also hold personal significance.\n\nMy desire to help others has been a long-standing aspect of my personality, although I initially struggled to identify a career path that aligned with this passion. Throughout my high school and college years, I observed individuals frequently avoiding their problems and adopting unconventional coping mechanisms. These experiences prompted me to choose a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, which, however, did not initially clarify my career direction. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break before encountering a pivotal experience that shifted my perspective. I met a 16-year-old boy who was fleeing his abusive home and had called the police for assistance. Upon learning of the situation, I visited the boy's parents' residence, where I expressed my concerns to the police and offered to talk to the parents. My conversation with them raised red flags, as they seemed evasive and made excuses for the boy's behavior. This encounter instilled in me a strong desire to pursue a career in social work, which I believe will enable me to make a difference in the lives of children and families facing similar challenges.\n\nAnother essential value in the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we often claim to value individuality, yet we often conform to traditional norms. I, on the other hand, believe in embracing my uniqueness and not limiting myself to societal expectations. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively spoke out against social injustices, whether through self-expression (e.g., unconventional hairstyles, piercings), my involvement with the Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance, or advocating against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it. My commitment to social justice remains unwavering, and I intend to continue fighting for equality and human rights.",
            "This paper delves into the dual perspectives of biological and sociocultural models in understanding the complex nature of insomnia, a sleep disorder that affects individuals worldwide. The biological model centers on the genetic and medical aspects of sleep, encompassing heritable factors and physiological processes. Conversely, the sociocultural model examines the environmental factors, including demographics, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity, which play a significant role in shaping sleep patterns. This comprehensive review aims to explore these models by analyzing relevant research and critiquing its strengths and limitations.\n\nInsomnia can be classified into three primary categories: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to mental health conditions, and sleep disorders caused by medical complications or substance intake. Primary sleep disorders, such as Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, are characterized by difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep or experiencing behavioral and physiological abnormalities during sleep. Dyssomnias, which include conditions like insomnia and hypersomnia, are marked by difficulties in falling asleep or staying awake, respectively. In contrast, Parasomnias, including nightmare disorder and sleepwalking disorder, are associated with behavioral and physiological irregularities during sleep. Other mental health-related sleep disorders involve sleep disturbances stemming from Axis I or Axis II disorders.\n\nFocusing on the biological model, research has identified neurons in the hypothalamus, specifically those containing orexin, as crucial for regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice revealed the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons, which are responsible for sleep-wake states. The activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while inhibition leads to reduced anxiety and improved sleep quality. The use of a GABAB agonist, baclofen, was found to increase sleep duration, implying a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. This study's findings have significant implications, suggesting that a problem or absence of this receptor could impair an individual's ability to sleep without medication, negatively impacting daily life and productivity, including tasks that require focus and concentration.",
            "This paper delves into three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Firstly, it offers a concise definition of the condition. Secondly, it explains the diagnostic process, highlighting common characteristics or warning signs. Lastly, it discusses ways in which a teacher in a mainstream classroom can support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to the brain's ability to effectively utilize auditory information. In essence, it is a condition where the central nervous system struggles to process sounds, despite the ability to hear normally. Unlike hearing impairments, individuals with CAPD are not deaf, but their brains have difficulty interpreting and distinguishing between sounds, separating words from background noise, and differentiating between various conversations.\n\nThe earliest recorded mention of CAPD dates back to the 1950s, when researchers identified \"auditory imperception\" as a relevant area of study in children with communication disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari developed tests for these children in 1954, and in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the physiological workings of the brain during dichotic perception. A national conference in 1977 sparked further research into CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways, including difficulties in localizing sounds, distinguishing between multiple sounds, recognizing sound patterns, and detecting changes in speech, such as sarcasm. Additionally, individuals with CAPD may struggle to focus on specific sounds amidst background noise, synthesize sound clues, and determine the sequence of auditory information. \n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a comprehensive evaluation is conducted using systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests. This can be carried out by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals using a range of measures that assess auditory-related skills. The evaluation may include questionnaires, surveys, and observation of auditory behaviors in response to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single, consistently effective diagnostic tool, and the underlying cause of CAPD remains unknown. Diagnostic tests often present multiple auditory stimuli simultaneously and ask the individual to identify specific items, such as words or numbers. More advanced assessments involve recording and measuring the brain's response to acoustic signals within the ear.",
            "The play Twelfth Night appears to convey that while disguises can be used to deceive others for an extended period, ultimately, a person must discard their disguise to avoid losing themselves in the process. However, abandoning deception can lead to feelings of isolation, as one may be disconnected from those around them. As a result, individuals must weigh their own self-preservation against the preservation of their relationships. Although reactions to being deceived can vary, some may react neutrally, while others will be offended by the deception. This is particularly problematic when it involves gender role reversal, as it raises questions about the underlying motivations for adopting a disguise. \n\nIn the case of Viola, her decision to disguise herself as a man is driven by self-protection, as reflected in her words: \"I'll take you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). Initially, her plan is successful in protecting her, but it also creates a distance between her and the women around her, leaving her without a support system. Furthermore, her disguise is so convincing that it leads to confusion, as Olivia mistakenly falls in love with her. Viola also has to navigate her unrequited love for Orsino, as well as suppressed romantic desires: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love a woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nFrom a modern perspective, Twelfth Night may be seen as an example of how deception can facilitate the exposure of repressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that these characters may have unconscious desires that are forced to the surface by Viola's disguise. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because of his appearance as a man, or does she genuinely harbor feelings for women? Although it is likely that Olivia is not attracted to women, her character may be satirizing the tendency of people to judge others based on appearance. This is evident in her swift transition from loving Cesario to regarding him as a family member: \"A sister, you are she\" (5.1.315).",
            "German colonial rule was characterized by varying degrees of brutality, particularly in relation to the atrocities committed against the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. The diversity of the German colonial empire, encompassing different policies, ruling styles, and geographical areas, complicates a simplistic analysis. Educational systems across the colonies also showed significant variations. When the British took over German East Africa (now Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large, educated, and literate African population, a result of German educational efforts. Conversely, German educational initiatives in Kamerun and other colonies received praise from contemporary writers. \n\nHowever, German South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast. Unlike in East Africa, where the government invested in state schools and played a significant role in native education, in South West Africa the responsibility was largely left to missionary societies with limited government support. Yet, the government invested substantial resources in educating Europeans in the colony, establishing a system of state schools and heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. This disparity in educational policies would have lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. In stark contrast to other German colonies, where a significant number of Africans were literate and educated, 'the overwhelming majority of the population in South West Africa remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.' Various factors contributed to this divergent experience, including social, political, and economic considerations.\n\nThis paper aims to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and focusing on recent research into the views of settlers and colonial authorities on native Africans. A substantial body of literature exists on education within the German colonial empire, primarily in German and written in the early 20th century. Early works mainly focused on describing the educational systems in these colonies, while later English-language writings expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education across the various German colonies and more in-depth analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant differences in educational systems across the various colonies. Cohen's study, which compared the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa and highlighted the factors contributing to the differences between them, is a prominent example of this work. According to Cohen, the significant settler population in South West Africa is a major factor in the distinguishing characteristics of the colony's educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, despite being largely covered by arid desert. This favorable climate contributed to a relatively large European population in South West Africa. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, significantly more than the approximately 5,336 settlers in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population.",
            "Over the past 100 years, the classification of popular music has become increasingly complex due to the numerous genres that have emerged. Many of these genres, such as rock, country, jazz, and folk, have branched out into multiple sub-genres, making it challenging to create a definitive list. One genre that has exploded with diversity is heavy metal rock, which has become one of the most expressive and dynamic genres in popular music over the past 40 years. Characterized by its ability to convey a wide range of emotions, heavy metal tends to focus on the darker side of the emotional spectrum. This genre's versatility has led to the creation of numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, resulting in a vast array of styles within the heavy metal movement.\n\nToday, the heavy metal genre has become so diverse and niche-specific that it can be difficult to pinpoint its exact definition. The genre has incorporated elements from other genres while still maintaining its unique identity. To understand the vast array of metal music that exists today, it is essential to grasp the origins and evolution of the heavy metal movement.\n\nAt its core, the heavy metal movement is defined by its association with darkness, which is reflected in its music, often characterized by its greater emphasis on bass, volume, and theatricality. Heavy metal music is also marked by its technical complexity, with musicians showcasing their exceptional skill and musicianship. Additionally, the genre has a history of being linked to the use of psychedelic drugs, particularly during the 1970s, which influenced the creation of some of its most iconic and experimental records. The genre's dark, visceral qualities were a departure from the more lighthearted and mainstream music that dominated the music scene at the time. Later generations of metal musicians drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's emphasis on the darker aspects of human emotion. Examples of lyrics, such as those found in Helter Skelter by the Beatles, demonstrate the genre's affinity for exploring the darker side of human experience. This song, often cited as one of the first heavy metal songs, was a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier and darker style, showcasing the Beatles' ability to create music that was equally intense and heavy.",
            "Well before the Surrealist movement took shape, Henri Rousseau was working tirelessly to bring his dreams to life, both literally and figuratively. His 1910 painting, The Dream, captures not only the wonder of a woman as she explores a mystical land within her dreams but also Rousseau's own aspirations as an artist. Throughout his career, he longed for recognition, acclaim, and admiration from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, but this aspiration came with an inner conflict. Rousseau had to decide whether to conform to established artistic styles to gain acceptance from the art world he admired or maintain his creative independence and forge his own path.\n\nTo fully understand the significance of The Dream, one must first delve into Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the French town of Laval, he was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle. Despite having no formal art training, Rousseau worked as a municipal toll service employee until the age of 40, earning the nickname 'douanier,' or customs inspector. His life took a significant turn after the death of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children, leaving him with a daughter, Julia, and immense sadness. To find solace and a fresh start, Rousseau turned to painting. Unlike his contemporaries who often romanticized and idealized peasants in their work, Rousseau's paintings reflected his humble background and the hopes and fears of the average person from his social class.\n\nRousseau's desire for acceptance by the art world is understandable given his circumstances. He began his artistic career at an older age, with no formal education in painting, and was producing works alongside many other talented and well-known modern artists. It wasn't until around the same time that Matisse started gaining recognition as an artist that Rousseau received proper recognition for his art. According to author Jan Gordon in his book Modern French Painters, Rousseau and Matisse were distinct not only in their style and subject matter but also in their motivations for creating art. While Matisse sought to avoid painting in a predictable way, Rousseau aimed to create conventional works that would earn him acceptance by the Artiste Français.",
            "The idea that ethics and aesthetics are interconnected has been a concept explored by many influential thinkers. I agree that there's a fundamental basis for this connection. John Keats' famous quote from \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know,\" highlights the notion that truth and beauty are deeply intertwined. While our understanding of the world is often acquired through education and experience, we don't learn to appreciate ethics and aesthetics in the same way. Both ethics and aesthetics are descriptive, rather than prescriptive, and our studies of morality and beauty aim to explain why something is beautiful or moral, rather than provide a set of rules for creating or assessing it.\n\nIn fact, it's challenging to fully capture the essence of what makes something good or beautiful through criticism. Discussions about the value of a work of art, like the Mona Lisa, may focus on technical aspects such as composition, contrast, or cultural context, but these elements don't fully convey why it's considered a masterpiece. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often respond with phrases like \"There's just something about it,\" which hints at a deeper, more complex understanding. Both art and morals seem to possess an intangible quality that cannot be reduced to a detailed description. This is echoed in the words of Flannery O'Connor, who said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, ethics has this same transcendent quality, as Ludwig Wittgenstein noted, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\"\n\nThis transcendent nature of both ethics and aesthetics serves as a common thread between them. Furthermore, both morality and art have a profound impact on us at a level that cannot be fully explained, a phenomenon described as \"noumenal\" in philosophical terms. This connection is particularly strong when it comes to literature, as it uniquely combines art and moral quality. As pointed out by McKean, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about it, is its moral quality.\" Literature, like life itself, inherently involves values, making it a vital source of moral guidance and inspiration.",
            "Germany is a unified nation with its unique cultural identity spanning from the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea in Kiel, and from the Rhine River in Cologne to the Elbe River in Dresden. This diverse culture is shaped by its complex history, which is influenced by various tribes and sources. The origin of the name \"Germany\" is a topic of ongoing debate among scholars and historians.\n\nSome believe that the name \"Germany\" originated from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, as suggested by the Roman historian Tacitus. According to Tacitus, the Romans adopted the term \"Germanus\" from the Gauls, using it to distinguish between the Gauls they had conquered and the Germanic tribes they had not. However, the Gauls themselves may have derived the term from a local word, possibly referring to a neighbor or a geographical location. Julius Caesar used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, describing the Germans as a formidable force that frequently clashed with the Gauls.\n\nAnother theory suggests that the name \"Germany\" is derived from the word \"ger,\" an Old English term for spear, or from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout\" or \"loud,\" implying that the Germans were a vocal and assertive people. The Roman historian Tacitus wrote in his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" that the Germans were an indigenous people, untainted by immigration or cultural exchange with other civilizations. However, the Romans did have contact with the Germanic tribes, who lived on the borders of the empire and engaged in trade and military service with the Romans.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes emerged in the 1st century AD, they interacted with the Roman Empire, trading goods and skills, and serving in the Roman army. While the Romans maintained their dominance over the empire, they also acknowledged the Germanic tribes as a significant force, with Tacitus describing them as a people of strong character and distinct culture.",
            "My gaze fell downwards, and my mind was consumed by the scene in front of me, yet I couldn't process it emotionally.  I observed it with a detached mindset, unable to link the object of my gaze to any deeper understanding.  Thoughts flashed in my mind, only to quickly disappear, leaving me with a sense of disconnection from my own thoughts.  My consciousness functioned smoothly, allowing me to experience the scene unfolding before me without any personal interpretation.\n\nThe memory of an art instructor's advice led me to purchase \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" a book that aimed to teach drawing techniques.  Having been fascinated with drawing since childhood, this book provided a comprehensive guide, covering even the basics, such as understanding the properties of a pencil and the brain's processes for interpreting lines.  One of the techniques the book recommended was to place a frame around the subject to be drawn, simplifying complex scenes and allowing for a clearer understanding of the composition.  However, at that moment, I found it difficult to mentally apply this concept to the scene before me – a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen – as I was overwhelmed by its complexity.\n\nAs I stood there, lost in the beauty of the scene, I couldn't help but think of famous artists like Picasso, Monet, and the masters of the Italian Renaissance, each with their unique style and color palette.  If I wanted to create something worthy of being called art, then this was the starting point, the beginning of my artistic journey, titled \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingers instinctively reached for the pencil, my hand tensed and relaxed as I prepared to create.  However, my action was interrupted by a sudden urge, and I found myself gripping the toilet handle, my muscles tensing with each attempt to dislodge the stubborn brown mass.  The toilet refused to cooperate, and my hand slapped against the handle in frustration.  Holding a mop, wearing a green tie that felt constricting, and gazing at the unappealing waste left behind by someone else, I felt a mix of emotions.  After a few more flushes, I took a deep breath, stood up straight, and with a sense of resolve, I grasped the toilet paper and wrapped my hand around it, creating a makeshift mitten.  With a newfound determination, I leaned forward, my hand slowly entering the bowl, as if I was preparing to retrieve something precious.",
            "The alarming number of teenager fatalities on the road is largely due to a combination of factors that are uniquely tied to this age group.  According to the National Institutes of Health, one key reason stems from the fact that the teenage brain is not fully equipped to handle the dangers associated with driving.  Additionally, inexperience plays a significant role, not only in increasing the likelihood of fatal accidents but also in contributing to higher rates of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and off-road incidents.\n\nIt is also evident that teenagers are more prone to accidents when they drive with their peers, which is a common occurrence.  A study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a correlation between the age of passengers and the number of traffic accidents that occur.  Various states, including California, have attempted to mitigate this issue by introducing temporary provisional licenses, which restrict the driving hours of teens and prohibit them from transporting other minors.\n\nHowever, these measures, in my opinion, are merely temporary solutions.  The fundamental issue lies in the fact that, as a group, the youngest drivers lack the capacity to adequately manage the risks and responsibilities associated with driving.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman suggests that 18 is still too young for a regular driver's license, citing his research on the common desire among those under 19-20 to engage in thrill-seeking behavior.  Given this, it makes sense to delay driving privileges until this tendency has diminished.  If we persist in issuing driver's licenses to young teens, we can expect to see a continuous rise in fatal accidents, with potentially catastrophic consequences in the coming years.  By 2010, the Baby Boomer generation's children will be reaching driving age, and millions of new teen drivers will be hitting the roads.\n\nTo address this issue, legislation that restricts driving to those 18 and above could be implemented.  Schools could continue to provide driver's education classes to facilitate the learning process, while provisional permits could still be issued prior to a full driver's license.  The required hours of practical driver's training could be based on the existing standards in the majority of states, such as California's requirement of 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice.  Given that the statistics on teen driver fatalities are consistent across the country, a uniform national law addressing this issue would be a sensible and effective means of protecting young drivers nationwide.\n\nThis proposed legislation is not a novel concept, but rather a well-reasoned and necessary step towards reducing the risk of teenage driver fatalities.",
            "Upon examining the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I decided to view all 15 trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films primarily relied on creative editing to create illusions. My analysis focused on analyzing the artistic aspects of trick films and identifying the unique characteristics of some of the later films. Early trick films were generally shot on a static set within a frontal proscenium framework, using long and medium shots, and adhering to the convention of one shot per film. However, some early 20th-century films experimented with this approach by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne common trait among trick films is the use of an interior set within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remained stationary, not moving to follow characters or objects. This technique was inspired by theatrical and vaudeville performances, where magic and illusions were common. A notable limitation of this method is that characters' movements were restricted to side-to-side movements, with no ability to move towards or away from the camera. \n\nFor instance, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from one side and move horizontally within the frame. Even when they exit the frame, the camera does not follow them. The frontal proscenium style often resulted in long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-up shots were not used in any of the Edison catalog trick films, as this format was inherited from the theatre and vaudeville traditions, where the audience could see the entire performance within a framed stage. As in early cinema, actors rarely moved towards the camera, making close-ups impossible.\n\nMost early trick films adhered to the convention of one conceptual shot per film, restricting their length to around a minute or less, depending on the frame rate used. This limitation also restricted the narrative and dramatic potential of trick films, which primarily focused on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing acts, and quick changes. However, in trick films, a single conceptual shot might be composed of multiple physical shots, used to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. In the film The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), for example, a closer examination reveals the point where the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the whole film is perceived as one shot.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early advocate for Republicanism, and his profession as an agriculturalist, along with his brief foray into politics, made him known for his unwavering commitment to individual freedom and limited government. His agrarian views served as the foundation for his opinions on governance, as he sought to protect and promote this occupation as the most superior career. This perspective influenced his perspectives on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judicial system, as he aimed to preserve the integrity of what he considered the ideal profession.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a unique opportunity to establish an ideal system of government, free from the constraints of native traditions that might have hindered its development. He firmly believed in the inherent rights of individuals, which are interconnected and interdependent, and that compromising one right would undermine the value of the remaining ones. Consequently, he argued that these rights should be beyond the reach of the government. He saw the concept of the \"state of nature\" as an era where the strong and cunning profited, but in a civilized society, this should not be the case.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor believed that a government must be designed to account for the dual nature of human beings, comprising both good and evil. He adhered to a rigid dualistic morality and contended that a government, being run by humans, would inevitably reflect both its virtues and vices. He defined good principles as those that protect private property, promote agriculture, and discourage capitalism, and believed that a government founded on these principles would function fairly, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by self-interest and avarice. However, he distinguished between self-interest as a motivation for creating a society for the public good and its manifestation as a destructive force that exploits others. A good government was essential to contain humanity's inherent evil, and it must be closely monitored to prevent the introduction of bad principles.\n\nLike many other Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution, limiting the federal government to only the powers explicitly stated in the document. He recognized that an extensive federal government would be costly and prone to despotism, but also believed that a literal interpretation without considering the intent of the Founding Fathers could be hazardous. Moreover, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more explicitly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Analyzing the data in Figure 17, we observed a significant decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project, which was disappointing to note. It's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause for this drop. The onset of winter could have led to a decrease in cycling and walking commutes, and the end of the fall semester might have left some people too busy with schoolwork and end-of-semester tasks to participate. Additionally, the holiday season's timing coincided with the month-long winter break for students and faculty, which likely reduced the need for commuting. The resumption of classes in late January might have also contributed to the low log submissions for that month. Given this context, it's puzzling that the low submission numbers persisted into February. It's possible that the project experienced an initial surge in interest that naturally waned over time, as seen in many similar initiatives. To counteract this decline, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week, a special promotional campaign in March that led to an increase in log submissions. However, we faced challenges in sustaining project momentum, particularly due to the natural decrease in engagement and the impact of holiday and semester breaks on academic settings. Another hurdle in promoting alternative commuting modes is the entrenched cultural preference for driving personal vehicles, which offers a sense of freedom and independence. To encourage participation, we offered prizes in the form of gift certificates to local businesses, but it would have been intriguing to explore the effect of larger, more substantial prizes, such as bicycles or eco-friendly cars. Offering escalating prizes throughout the project might have helped maintain interest, as the initial incentive of gift cards seemed to wane over time. If we had announced more substantial prizes in December and January, participation might have increased instead of decreasing.",
            "An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that mirrors the performance of a specific index, commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund, but offers greater flexibility and trades on a stock exchange like a stock.  ETFs provide the diversification benefits of an index fund and the advantages of individual stock ownership, such as the ability to short sell, buy on margin, and purchase a single share.  While these benefits are highly appealing, the expense ratios of ETFs are lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, there are some drawbacks, including the need to pay a commission for each trade involving ETFs, just like with stock transactions.  One of the significant advantages of ETFs is the wide range of available funds. It is essential for savvy investors to critically evaluate the benefits of ETFs, such as diversification, to determine if they truly exist and to what extent.  In this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to assess whether the benefits of owning a single ETF are comparable to those of a diversified portfolio of the 10 stocks and whether there are alternative configurations that could provide a more optimal risk-adjusted return.\n\nTo simplify the evaluation, we have chosen to focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Below is a list of the top 10 holdings and their respective percentages of total assets.\n\nTo gauge how well the top 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current asset percentages to calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's beta and return if the portfolio consisted entirely of these 10 stocks, in the same proportion as the ETF's holdings. The beta and return calculations are presented in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, it is clear that a portfolio consisting of only the top 10 holdings would generate a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns. It is also evident that the beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. Our preliminary findings suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings may offer higher returns with lower risk. However, there is a possibility that the differences between the two portfolios may not be statistically significant.\n\nTo determine whether these portfolios are statistically different, we calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considers \"Dream-Land\" to be one of his standout poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" twice, which Mabbott attributes to Virgil's work. However, it is unclear if Virgil was the primary source, as Poe was heavily influenced by German literature, particularly the works of Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was a renowned poet who wrote the famous play \"Faust,\" which includes a poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells the story of a king who, after his wife's death, becomes consumed by grief and turns to excessive drinking. The king's descent into despair serves as a poignant parallel to the speaker's experience in \"Dream-Land,\" where he describes a dark and lonely world devoid of color.\n\nInterestingly, Goethe's poem \"The King of Thulé\" bears a striking resemblance to \"Dream-Land.\" In both works, the protagonist grapples with the loss of a loved one and finds solace in drinking. It is possible that Poe was drawing inspiration from Goethe's work. Furthermore, Goethe's influence can be seen in the fact that Poe references Thule twice in his collected writings, once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and again at the beginning and end of \"Dream-Land.\" This repetition suggests that the two poems are companion pieces, with \"Dream-Land\" serving as a dark reflection of \"The King of Thulé.\"\n\nConsidering Goethe's significant impact on the literary world, it is likely that Poe would have been familiar with his work. As a testament to Goethe's reputation, Poe expressed his admiration for Tennyson, indicating that he held Goethe in high esteem. Additionally, the many reproductions of Goethe's works that were published after its initial release would have also exposed Poe to his writing.",
            "Under California law, a customer who suffered an injury after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill at a grocery store may be eligible for punitive damages if it can be proven that the store manager acted with malice, defined as a deliberate disregard for the potential harm that could result from their actions. A court is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages at this stage. To be entitled to punitive damages, Palmer must provide evidence that the store manager's actions were taken with a deliberate and conscious disregard for the potential harm that could occur, as well as proof that the actions were despicable. Palmer can argue that the store manager should have realized the potential harm of not cleaning the spill, given that several customers had previously slipped and fallen in the store before her accident, and despite this knowledge, the manager still failed to clean the spill. Although Palmer's argument that the manager's actions were despicable is not strong, it remains valid given the frequency of slip-and-fall incidents at the store, with six incidents reported in 2009 and the manager failing to take adequate measures to ensure the safety of customers.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee informed the store manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle, but Martin responded that he was on a break and did not have time to deal with customer complaints. Fifteen minutes later, another employee reported the spill, and Martin gave the same response. At 5:30 pm, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, suffering a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at the store in 2009. Palmer is now suing the store for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion to dismiss the punitive damage claim.\n\nUnder California law, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation that is not related to a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, where the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of their actions and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.",
            "It has been almost four years since I took a course on Islam at CBC, which sparked a heated debate in class about whether Islam is inherently hostile.  I believe this question remains more relevant now than ever, especially considering the shift in media's portrayal of Islam and extremists since the events of 9/11.  Looking back, it's remarkable that in 2001, a presidential candidate like Barack Obama with a Muslim background would have been unimaginable. \n\nThe life of the Prophet, as I've learned from its biography, presents a contradictory image of Muhammad, one that diverges from the conventional understanding of his character.  I had previously believed that Muhammad was a forceful leader who coerced people into converting to Islam, but the biography portrays him as a humble figure who was misunderstood and was humbled by others.  As a result, people gradually came to appreciate the truth in his teachings and sought him out. \n\nThere are intriguing parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the accounts of Muhammad's miracles, with one notable instance being the occasion when he multiplied food and drink to feed a group of forty men.  The narrative style employed in the biography creates an image of Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, but instead lived a life of truth and performed miracles.  This portrayal weakens the significance of Jesus Christ's life and miracles, much like a comparison between the two figures.  It is almost as if the authors are attributing the essence of Jesus' life to Muhammad. \n\nThe biography also includes numerous stories that seem to be designed to demonstrate how people independently converted to Islam, but many of these accounts rely on second-hand or even third-hand retellings.  This approach not only diminishes the credibility of the stories but also raises suspicions. \n\nWhat bothers me most about this biography is its attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure who embodies humility, compassion, and wisdom.  However, historical records contradict this image, and I find it puzzling that Muslims today may not be aware of the true circumstances surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus were quickly left behind in the development of Christian thought after his time.  If we look at the history of Christianity in broad terms, we notice a pattern of the faith drifting further and further away from its origins.  Presently, we are witnessing an increased awareness and a growing trend of progress.  Traditional followers may resist any ideas that stray from the teachings they were taught, but their influence may not be significant enough to impact the entire community.  As time passes, Christians will become increasingly aware of their history, and a desire will arise to distinguish between the original intent of Jesus' message and the additional doctrines that have been incorporated into the religion over time.  This process may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome is inevitable:  A reversal of the trend in Christian history will occur, and the faith will return to its original form.  A movement will emerge that will gradually strip away layers of doctrine, much like time moving backward, leaving only the fundamental principles that Jesus introduced, untainted by later interpretations.  When this shift takes hold in the United States and Europe, it will bring about a renewed focus on Jesus' original message, and people will come together to worship in a manner true to his teachings.  The church as an institution will still maintain its strength, guiding the way forward, but the diversity of Christian denominations will give way to increasing uniformity of belief and practice.  We will see a decrease in differences between regions, denominations, and divisions, and an increase in similarities.  History is replete with examples of reversals, such as the transformation of the Roman Empire from a persecutor of Christians to a Christian institution.  Our country has also experienced a similar transformation, evolving from a time of African-American slavery to a period of African-American leadership.  The future holds a similar reversion for Christianity, as it seeks to return to its roots and undo the diversity that has developed over time.  This process will be facilitated by a shift in how Jesus' words are interpreted, from being seen as literal statements to being understood as metaphors.  To understand what has transpired since Jesus' lifetime, we must look back to the early history of Judaism, which served as the foundation for the Christian faith.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the concept of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were already at the heart of the Jewish faith.  The Jewish population was not unified, instead being divided into groups such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people.",
            "I firmly believe that The Jungle reveals the inherent selfishness and self-centered nature of humans. As individuals, people prioritise their own interests over others, striving for personal gain and comfort, regardless of the consequences for those around them. The novel portrays this self-absorption through various examples, particularly in the actions of the factory owners and managers. Driven solely by a desire for expansion and profit, they disregard the well-being of employees, the environment, and even their own workers' safety. Upton Sinclair's vivid descriptions, such as the image of \"the line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky,\" illustrate the devastating impact of pollution caused by these factories. He highlights the owners' callous disregard for those affected by their operations, including the pollution produced by their factories and the unsanitary conditions in the surrounding areas.\n\nThe book also sheds light on the exploitative nature of the owners towards their employees. They show no qualms about sacrificing their workers' welfare in pursuit of profit, as evident from Sinclair's statement that \"there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The employees were forced to work in grueling conditions and were laid off at will, without any support or compensation. During the time period depicted in the novel, the lack of protective laws and regulations enabled the owners to exploit their employees, pushing them to work at an exhausting pace in hazardous conditions. The workers, who lived and worked in Packingtown, were essentially expected to endure these harsh circumstances without any assistance or support. The absence of organisations to provide aid and information to workers, and the shortcomings of unions that profited from their suffering, left them with no escape from the oppressive system. The novel ultimately portrays the workers as being treated like slaves, forced to survive on the whims of their exploiters, and as a result, immorality and desperation became rampant in the community.",
            "Many authors employ various literary techniques to evoke specific emotions or attitudes in their readers. Some methods are more effective than others. In his novel The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes a range of these techniques to create a particular atmosphere. One technique he frequently uses is combining adjectives with nouns in unexpected ways to convey a certain image. Another technique is assigning symbolic meaning to objects and using them to convey a particular message. Fitzgerald applies this latter technique to several colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, he establishes associations for white/gray and red/pink and then leverages these associations to evoke a particular feeling or idea in the reader when describing significant objects.\n\nFitzgerald creates associations for the colors white and gray, with white representing something finer and more refined, while gray symbolizes something older and faded. He establishes these meanings early in the novel by consistently using both colors. For instance, Daisy and Jordan are frequently described wearing white, and others, such as Nick and Tom, also wear white attire. The only time people are not dressed in white is when Nick is describing Gatsby's party, which is \"gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald further defines these colors by associating them with everyday objects and common subjects, such as when Nick goes to work and sees \"white chasms\" in New York City or when the names of people at Gatsby's party are listed as \"gray\" on Nick's schedule. He also describes ordinary people and places as white or gray, like Jordan and Daisy's \"white girlhood\" or the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes.\n\nOnce Fitzgerald establishes these meanings, he uses white and gray to convey the idea that certain subjects are unimportant or mundane. This approach begins with Daisy. After a period of time without using these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as wearing white in a car, which makes her appear less as a distinct character and more as a uniform element that Gatsby desires. He employs this technique with Daisy multiple times to create this image of her being a uniform addition. For example, there is a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and she is again dressed in white before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County has a thriving agricultural sector, primarily due to its pleasant and sunny climate. Local farmers cultivate a variety of crops such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a significant demand for organic community-supported agriculture in the area, with numerous local organizations facing lengthy waiting lists for their produce, including organic eggs and milk. Many organic farms offer guided tours of their operations, allowing visitors to engage in outdoor activities like hiking and birdwatching. This type of farming model enables landowners to participate in government programs, conserve the environment, and create opportunities for recreational activities and educational programs while generating revenue.\n\nIn addition to capitalizing on a lucrative market niche, organic farming has several benefits, including increased biodiversity in the area, thanks to the absence of chemical use in the soil and water. However, organic farming often incurs higher costs compared to conventional methods, requiring more labor and management to control pests and weeds without chemicals, and potentially resulting in greater losses. Small-scale organic farms also face challenges related to efficiency and scale, especially when compared to larger operations. Furthermore, practices beneficial to wildlife, such as planting cover crops and removing invasive species, can also be labor-intensive. These factors highlight the need for landowners to seek financial assistance or expertise in optimizing both profitability and environmental quality.\n\nThe chosen property, located near the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California, is a 160-acre parcel featuring chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This area falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which aims to protect over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nThis land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 19th century. The property was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and wood production for many years. To better understand the viable options for a small farmer in this area, a search of real estate websites and government programs was conducted. A comparable organic farm in the same region was identified as a model for potential operations.",
            "Effective negotiation relies heavily on understanding the nuances of culture, which cannot be defined by a single, fixed identity. Rather, it encompasses a complex web of what it signifies and what it's not. It's essential to recognize that cultures are diverse, multifaceted, and not limited to national or geographical boundaries. A culture's generalizations, such as labeling an entire nation as stubborn or accommodating, are overly simplistic and lack depth. To be productive in negotiation, one must consider the significance of a culture to the specific situation at hand and how its attitudes will influence the negotiation process.\n\nWhen interacting with a foreign culture, we tend to draw comparisons to our own, which can lead to oversimplification. A more effective approach is to accept and respect the culture for what it is, rather than trying to change or judge it. This is particularly crucial when negotiating with a weaker bargaining position. Recognizing and respecting the traditions and beliefs of the opposing culture can help overcome cultural barriers and facilitate progress in the negotiation.\n\nFurthermore, corporate culture can be just as distinct as national culture, with its own set of values, norms, and practices. A company's culture can be observed in its dress code, communication style, delegation of tasks, and hiring practices. This diversity is evident within a nation, with variations between companies and even within the same company across different regions and environments. It's essential to look beyond the surface level and appreciate the complexity of a culture.\n\nUnderstanding the values that drive a culture is crucial, as they reveal the underlying motivations and priorities. For instance, if saving face or communal harmony is valued, a negotiator will avoid public embarrassment or conflict to achieve success. On the other hand, if a culture prioritizes hard-driving bargains, a negotiator may be more likely to push for a deal. Considering these cultural differences before the negotiation is vital, but it's equally important to gain a personal understanding of the opposing party to create a more effective negotiation strategy.",
            "The phrase, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" originates in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and serves as the foundation of St. Anselm's argument for the existence of God. Interestingly, Thomas Aquinas shares a similar perspective on this issue. Since both authors present arguments in favor of the same concept, we will assume, for the sake of clarity, that both believe in the existence of the God described in the Bible. Focusing on a different concept of God would hinder a fair comparison between their arguments. Although each author raises valid points, neither provides a comprehensive basis for believing in God.\n\nTo illustrate this, we will first examine St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm's reasoning suggests a path of understanding that involves looking inward to find evidence of God's existence within one's own mind. He proposes that since God is a concept that we can understand, we cannot conceive of a world without him. In essence, Anselm argues that the proof for God lies within our own consciousness, and that we don't need external evidence to confirm his existence. This idea is closely tied to the concept of faith, where one accepts truth without absolute empirical proof, which is a common theme in Christian texts.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas presents a vastly different perspective. He believes that the existence of God can be proven solely through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith altogether. This approach could be beneficial for Christian evangelism as it would allow new converts to be persuaded by logic rather than relying on their willingness to accept something unproven. Aquinas supports his argument with five logical arguments: those of change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. By demonstrating the logical necessity of God's existence, Aquinas essentially shows that the existence of God is a fundamental requirement for understanding the world. Analogously, if you're given a puzzle with missing pieces, you can logically infer the features and existence of the missing piece even if you can't see it.",
            "About 2,500 years ago, a prince who would later be known as the Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned worldly life and attained enlightenment, which led to the development of Buddhism. The most traditional form of this religion is Theravada Buddhism, which has undergone significant changes since the Buddha's time. This can be observed in the annual Water-cutting ceremony in Sri Lanka, a Theravada nation, where both monks and lay people participate. The ceremony holds spiritual significance even though the Buddha never taught about any such celebration. This shows the extent to which the Theravada Buddhist community has adapted its core principles over time, influenced by both internal and external factors, both positive and negative.\n\nTo better understand this discussion, it's essential to understand the following key terms: internal and external forces, and hostile and benign influences. An internal force refers to any change initiated by members of the Buddhist community, regardless of their monastic status. An external force, on the other hand, comes from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any influence that causes harm or intends to harm the community, stemming from a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force, while not malicious, may unintentionally harm or benefit the community.\n\nThe discussion begins by examining the fundamental principles of Theravada Buddhism. At its core, Buddhists seek refuge in the 'Triple Gem': the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka, a collection of three baskets containing Buddhist scriptures. These include the Sutta Pitaka (Suttas), Vinaya Pitaka (disciplinary rules), and Abhidhamma Pitaka (metaphysical concepts). Key metaphysical ideas in Buddhism include the concept of Anatta (no permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these principles is crucial to breaking free from the cycle of death and rebirth (Samsara). Along with Samsara, one can overcome the causes of suffering, which include lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), upon achieving enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for laypeople and monks, with five precepts for the former (do not kill, lie, steal, engage in immoral conduct, or take intoxicants) and more rules for the latter. The Four Noble Truths form the foundation of Buddhist doctrine: the existence of suffering, its cause (attachment), and the possibility of overcoming it.",
            "The United States and Mexico serve as a striking example of two nations that were embroiled in a long-standing rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893, as documented by Diehl and Goerts (2000, p. 145). A pivotal moment in this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States defeated Mexico and successfully annexed Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Apart from this significant conflict, numerous other clashes took place between the two nations, eventually subsiding just before the onset of World War I. The underlying causes of this rivalry were rooted in fundamental disagreements over issues such as religion, culture, and tradition, alongside divergent material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis scenario is reminiscent of many other nations that have a long-standing rivalry with a neighboring country. Shared borders often give rise to conflicting interests, ultimately contributing to the formation of rival positions between the nations. The United States and Mexico are not exceptional in this regard, as David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that they are among the few nations that have consistently presented long-lasting diplomatic challenges to the United States, particularly compared to other Latin American countries that have historically enjoyed good relations with the US.\n\nThe religious differences between the two nations played a significant role in exacerbating the rift, a phenomenon that has been observed in many historical conflicts. According to Sally Frahm (2001), Americans were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries, much like their opposition to fascism and communism in the 20th century (p. 86). The ideological tensions between the United States and Mexico were, in this case, primarily driven by differences in religious preferences, rather than political structures. This mistrust was largely inherited from the distrust between the English and Spanish, making it a major obstacle to establishing amicable relations between the two nations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identify 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States that occurred during the 57-year period of rivalry. The majority of these disputes involved territorial issues, including border raids and frontier problems, such as those caused by Mexican bandits and outlaws from American border towns. These issues persisted until both nations deployed military force to secure their borders (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry between the two nations began to subside as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States and eventually ceased as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the latter part of the 19th century (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly afflicted with a condition I had never known existed while working as a nurse. Growing up, I had chosen nursing as a profession due to its stability and security, which was something I lacked as a child. People consistently told me, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" Although my true ambitions were to be a scientist or journalist, I settled for nursing. Now, at 46 and single, I have exhausted my savings and am unable to work due to my ongoing disability. I've relied on Social Security Disability for 15 years and have nothing to call my own. Each day is a struggle to ensure my safety, security, and self-worth. However, I've come to realize that without the support of my family and a few close friends, I wouldn't have made it. \n\nMy experience has taught me that we can never truly be prepared for every life emergency, no matter how well we plan. I agree that we should reduce our reliance on the government, which is often unstable. Nevertheless, I believe it's more crucial for Americans to relearn the importance of helping one another and asking for assistance. This attitude is more essential than individual survival tactics like building personal shelters. \n\nThe idea of \"rugged individualism,\" often promoted by Conservatives, is a myth. In reality, it was the compassion and collective support of our ancestors that helped them overcome hardships. Pioneers who crossed the country didn't achieve their goals alone; they relied on each other for aid and resources.\n\nWhile being prepared is vital, it's equally essential to build connections with those around you. I have a disaster kit and supplies, but I also believe in getting to know my neighbors. If possible, having a small farm and being able to preserve food can be beneficial. Additionally, owning a wood stove can be useful, but it's only feasible for those living in rural areas.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in a particular way remains a complex and multifaceted issue, with various factors influencing the direction of evolutionary change. Although the foundations of evolutionary biology have been laid, the field still lacks a comprehensive mathematical framework to describe even the simplest organic forms. Recent advancements in mathematical modeling have been applied to the development and evolution of mollusk shells, considering both the growth of individual organisms (ontogeny) and the history of their species (phylogeny). Our study aims to combine mathematical modeling with experimental research to uncover the underlying mechanisms driving the pace and extent of evolutionary-developmental change in the Prunum species. By analyzing X-ray images of Prunum species, we have identified quantifiable parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell, allowing us to simulate diverse shell shapes and explore the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. Our results are being integrated with experimental and observational studies to gain a deeper understanding of the major evolutionary events within this group of organisms.\n\nA mollusk shell can be thought of as a spiral structure that grows over time, spanning 360 degrees of space. The spiral turns or whorls of a coiled shell are arranged around an imaginary central axis, known as the columella, which runs through the central column of the shell. The rate at which the whorls expand can vary, and the continuous line separating each whorl is called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the body whorl, while the spire consists of all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different perspectives, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. The conventional orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count the number of whorls, an individual shell should be viewed from the apical perspective. The first suture is identified, and a line is drawn to divide the shell into two parts. Whorls are then counted from this line, with each whorl estimated to a quarter of a turn.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a series of openings that evolve over time and space as the animal builds its shell. By tracing the path of the aperture, which can be defined by the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture, we can graphically and mathematically represent the shell's growth pattern. Once a mathematical model is established, we can manipulate parameters to simulate changes in the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Despite some stabilization in neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia over the past decade, the country is still facing significant challenges in meeting its Millennium Development Goals, particularly in the areas of child and maternal health.  While Indonesia is making progress in certain areas, such as water and sanitation, the country's improvements in healthcare are lagging behind the required pace to meet its 2015 targets.  This situation necessitates strengthening of the overall healthcare system rather than focusing solely on specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has achieved some positive milestones, including an increase in the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% of births meeting this target.  However, this statistic includes traditional workers like midwives who may not be equipped to handle complications, resulting in high maternal mortality rates due to factors such as hemorrhage.  This improvement appears somewhat misleading, highlighting the need for further action.  Additionally, there has been a decline in the percentage of children under five treated by a healthcare professional for diarrheal cases, and postnatal care data is incomplete, indicating a pressing concern in this area.\n\nRegarding cesarean-section rates, Indonesia's rates are lower than expected, at around 4%, and this disparity is particularly concerning given the significant gap in rates between urban and rural areas, with urban settings recording a 7% rate compared to a mere 2% in rural areas.  This underscores the issue of unequal access to healthcare services across the country, with urban areas receiving more attention.  Another issue is vertical equity, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, suggesting that the poor face significant barriers in accessing healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nIn determining the most effective approach to improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is how to address the lack of access to healthcare services.  The key consideration is whether Indonesia should adopt program-specific approaches or strengthen its overall healthcare system without focusing solely on pre- and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children.  While programmatic approaches have the advantage of being more targeted and yielding faster results, they also have drawbacks, such as diverting resources away from other areas of the health sector and creating duplication of services and inefficient use of resources.  These challenges highlight the need for a more comprehensive approach to healthcare reform in Indonesia.",
            "Victorian novels are characterized by their meticulous attention to detail and a focus on the social elite of the time.  Two notable exceptions to this trend are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which deviate from the norm by incorporating elements of mystery and the unusual. These unconventional features heighten the complexity of the characters within each novel, offering deeper insights into their motivations and emotions.\n\nThis unorthodox approach is often achieved through dream sequences or dreamlike states, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy blur. In Oliver Twist, these enigmatic events frequently shed light on Oliver's inner struggles, revealing the pains and fears that haunt him. The repeated depiction of Oliver's reliving of the shooting incident in chapter 28 serves to emphasize his lack of agency and control over his circumstances. The passage highlights Oliver's diminished capacity for action, as he is overwhelmed by his emotions and unable to intervene, even when his life is at stake. This sense of powerlessness is further underscored by the description of his hallucinations, which are a manifestation of his deep-seated despair and fear. The shooting sequence also raises questions about the nature of fate versus free will, as it is clear that Oliver's misfortune is not a result of his own actions, but rather a consequence of external forces beyond his control. Furthermore, this episode implies a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if he has been broken by his circumstances, leading to a diminished capacity for resistance and self-preservation.\n\nThe passage also alludes to the cyclical nature of time, where days blend together in a seemingly endless cycle of darkness and brief moments of consciousness. The night is portrayed as both interminable and fleeting, a symbol of the monotony and despair that pervades Oliver's life.",
            "It's been a while since I worked in an after-school program where I helped elementary school students with their studies. My areas of expertise were in English and reading, so I focused on assisting students with those subjects. I was approached by one of the instructors to work with a boy named Adrian, who struggled with reading. As I observed him, I realized that something was amiss - he had a peculiar reading pattern; he could pronounce some letters correctly while others were completely off. It was a peculiar observation, especially considering his background, which I believed to be Latino, and the fact that he spoke fluent English. I eventually met his mother, who only spoke Spanish, and through my limited Spanish skills, I learned that the issue wasn't a lack of reading abilities, but rather unfamiliarity with the English alphabet. This understanding led me to hope that some guidance might be helpful in addressing his struggles.\n\nI share this story to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, particularly in California. It's essential to recognize that even students who speak English fluently can face significant challenges with reading. I believe that everyone acknowledges this problem exists, so let's explore potential solutions. In Adrian's case, individualized English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation, seemed like a viable approach. However, for students with limited English proficiency, the solution is more complex and multifaceted. No single approach, such as dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, or ESL classes, will suffice on its own. A comprehensive strategy that integrates these methods is necessary.\n\nThe dual language system is a promising idea that benefits not only English language learners but all students. Research has shown that children in bilingual education programs tend to outperform their peers academically. Some may believe that these programs are a waste of resources or that the majority of students won't benefit, but this misconception can be addressed by implementing such programs on a larger scale. To make this work, we don't need to require all teachers to be bilingual, which would be impractical. Instead, we can provide bilingual support staff, tutors, or aides to supplement the existing teaching staff.",
            "From a young age, most of us are told that there is something greater than ourselves, a concept that transcends our understanding. Some people attend religious institutions like Sunday school, temple, or search within themselves for answers, while others may adopt the faith of their upbringing. However, a few individuals reject these beliefs, insisting that there is no truth beyond their own personal reality. Throughout life, people may change their values and spiritual perspectives as they seek meaning and purpose. This search for a guiding light can be a universal human quest. \n\nAs I spent time with my father on the porch, watching the rain, he revealed his love for cardinals. His distant expression hinted at a mix of contemplation and nostalgia. His appearance had changed due to illness, and he seemed to be avoiding eye contact. I felt a deep sense of loneliness and anxiety, unable to discuss my impending loss, as talking about it would make the reality even more unbearable. I turned to physical comfort by hugging him and sitting closer. I joined him in gazing out into the rain, trying to connect with him one last time.\n\nMy father passed away in December, just a few days after my 22nd birthday. The treatment prolonged his life, but it couldn't ease his suffering. I struggled to comprehend the value of prolonging his suffering. I questioned the existence of a benevolent God, wondering if he had stopped listening to me long ago. I chose not to watch his final moments, as it would have been too painful to witness the end of the person who brought me into this world. I preferred to remember him as he lived, not as he died. I knew my father would not have wanted me to be present during his passing, so I didn't attend. I locked myself in my room for three days, waiting for the news to arrive.\n\nThe painful absence of a phone call underscored my sense of isolation during that difficult time.",
            "Ian Watt describes the traditional Gothic Novel as a contradictory term that combines the concepts of \"old\" and \"new,\" as seen in his work \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel.\" The Gothic mode has been met with both criticism and praise, with some viewing it as lacking depth and others admiring its ability to evoke a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). The original Gothic Novel, \"The Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole, drew inspiration from both ancient and modern romance styles to create a new genre and literary expression. By combining old theatrical elements with modern novelistic techniques, Walpole presented what he called a \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre incorporates elements from medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated in comparison to modern societal and literary advancements.\n\nThe combination of the theatrical aspects of the Gothic style and the innovative format of the novel, which allows readers a more personal insight into character psychology, has contributed to the genre's enduring appeal and timeless quality. Despite being considered outdated, the Gothic genre remains relevant to readers from different eras, offering a unique blend of old and new.\n\nOne of the key ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of chivalry. The medieval notion of chivalry, which involves the training of a knight, is reinterpreted and reimagined in \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Chivalry is significant to Gothic writers because it represents an idealized image of a brave, honorable, and competent knight, which they perceived as lacking in their own society. By incorporating chivalric concepts and ideals, Gothic writers idealized and romanticized the past, foreshadowing the evolution of the genre into Romanticism. This nostalgia for a bygone era is also a commentary on the perceived moral decline of society, particularly during times of political turmoil. In the case of \"The Castle of Otranto,\" the character of Frederic embodies many chivalric traits, as evident in his description, which includes images of a gallant and courteous knight who has suffered and is now presumed dead. This portrayal exemplifies the Gothic trope of excess, which is a recurring theme in the genre.",
            "Supply chain management encompasses a series of interconnected processes that span from the initial customer order to the delivery of products. The concept of supply chain management was first introduced by Keith Oliver in 1982, a consultant who described the process of planning, implementing, and overseeing the supply chain to meet customer needs efficiently. The six core components of a supply chain are production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. By leveraging these elements, business managers can provide top-notch customer service.\n\nProduction is the foundational step in the supply chain process, involving the planning and execution of when, where, and how products will be created. To determine customer requirements, managers analyze market trends, which serve as a crucial indicator of customer demands. Once market analysis is complete, they decide what products to produce, in what quantities, and allocate the production to the most suitable facilities, considering factors like volume and quality to meet customer expectations. Effective production planning is critical, as any lapses can result in substantial time and financial losses.\n\nThe second crucial element in supply chain management is supply, which involves strategic decisions regarding a facility's core capabilities and partnerships. Companies may have multiple divisions for producing a single product, each with unique equipment, personnel, and expertise. Managers must determine the most suitable division for each process and consider outsourcing to other companies to enhance velocity, a concept that enables quality, flexibility, and cost reduction. By streamlining processes, companies can achieve success in the competitive market.",
            "Ellen Page holds a haunting sign on a street corner, claiming that Hitler is alive in Burma, also known as Myanmar. Burma is a Southeast Asian country under the control of a ruthless military junta that seized power in 1962 through a military coup. In 2007, a wave of public protests erupted, led by a large number of Burmese monks, earning the name \"The Saffron Revolution\" due to the color of their robes. As the protests gained momentum, the government initially permitted the monks to hold peaceful gatherings, but violence escalated into a brutal conflict between the military and the monks, with the military invading monasteries and detaining foreign journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist who was killed while covering a protest. The true extent of the violence is estimated to be much higher than reported, with credible sources suggesting that thousands of people had been killed.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident, for the suppression of dissent and authoritarian rule have been recurring themes throughout history. From ancient Roman emperors claiming divine right to rule to modern-day examples like the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, where China's government brutally cracked down on peaceful demonstrators, and the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups and the government systematically targeted Tutsis and moderate politicians, the desire for total control over the population has been a persistent phenomenon. The Nazi regime's systematic persecution of Jews during World War II is another harrowing example of this trend.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring legacy in jazz can be attributed to his notable longevity and exceptional creativity, particularly in his ability to lead his orchestra. While Ellington's piano presence is subtle in many of his compositions, as a composer, he excelled in crafting intricate and complex pieces that showcased the individual talents of his band members. By designing a framework for improvisation and writing tightly orchestrated arrangements, Ellington enabled soloists to shine while also emphasizing the unique sound of the entire ensemble. This mastery of individual player styles and their harmonious integration allowed him to create groundbreaking pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative approach to music, citing Creole Love Call, where he employed the human voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This piece exemplifies his practice of incorporating voice to add texture and depth without the constraints of lyrics, demonstrating his ability to complement the style of his soloists. A notable example of this is Creole Love Call, a slow twelve-bar blues with six distinct choruses that showcase Ellington's versatility. These choruses include:\n\n- Chorus 1: A call-and-response pattern between voice and reeds, starting with smooth and melodic vocals and transitioning to a rougher tone.\n- Chorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the melody and emphasizes extended blue notes.\n- Chorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n- Chorus 4: A full band echo of the first chorus, featuring a call-and-response between the brass and reed sections.\n- Chorus 5: The climactic chorus, where the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\n- Chorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call-and-response between voice and reeds, this time with the voice adopting a growl-like tone and soloing as an instrument.\n- A brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add tonal color to Creole Love Call illustrates a recurring stylistic trait in his work. His later piece, Hot and Bothered, showcases his skill at tight orchestration and sensitivity to tone color. In this work, Ellington combines his talents by pairing a call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing, blending the vocal aspects of Miley's playing and the instrumental qualities of Cox's voice. His piece It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends this concept by effectively utilizing Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "She had always felt an unfulfilled longing, a yearning that never seemed to be satisfied. This desire had been present since she was 14 and in the midst of her teenage years, and it persisted at 17. At this stage, she realized she was searching for a person rather than an object, but she found no interest in any of the boys who had shown interest in her. Some had attempted to win her over, but none had sparked her attraction. She frequently questioned herself about this unusual phenomenon, trying to identify the reason behind it. Over the years, various theories came to mind, but none were convincing enough to satisfy her curiosity. As a result, she continued to navigate life with unanswered questions about her desires.\n\nTypically, her home was a peaceful place, filled with her calm and composed parents. They rarely argued with each other, and disagreements with their daughter were extremely rare. The only time they disagreed was when she asserted her independence and individuality. As the daughter of a calm couple, she stood out with her lively and fun personality, making her endearing to those around her.\n\nHowever, today was not a typical day. While searching for inspiration, she heard her mother's anguished cry and the sound of her injured voice coming from the kitchen. Panicked, she rushed into the room, exclaiming, \"Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the ground, writhing in pain and repeatedly uttering \"Ow\" in short gasps. Her daughter immediately ran to her side and placed a hand on her to offer assistance. \"It hurts so much... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother stammered between gasps. The daughter could sense the severity of her mother's pain. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where I should pick you up,\" she replied. Her mother directed her, and the daughter was grateful for her physical training, as she carefully lifted her mother and carried her to the car, placing her in the backseat.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought the pungent smells of disinfectant and illness, mixed with an air of anxiety. But her daughter's focus was solely on her mother's well-being as she quickly entered the hospital and called for medical assistance. The medical staff rushed to her side, and someone swiftly wheeled a hospital bed over and helped her mother onto it. The doctors immediately began assessing her condition, leaving the daughter to sit anxiously in the waiting area. It turned out that her mother had fallen off a step stool while trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "The purpose of this study was to determine whether adherence to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet, a modified version of the Med diet, is characterized by higher consumption of plant-based foods, including plant proteins, monounsaturated fats, and fish, as well as lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is also permitted.\n\nPrevious studies have shown an inverse relationship between adherence to the Med diet and total and cardiovascular mortality, with one intervention trial demonstrating that the Med diet is more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, previous research did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study involved 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 without a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. Over six periods from 1984 to 2004, the researchers computed an aMed diet score from self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake over the past year. More than 95% of the nurses continued their participation throughout the 20-year study period. The FFQs underwent validation studies, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. If necessary, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions falling into this category. The researchers also calculated body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use for each FFQ, with leisure-time physical activity being assessed starting in 1986.\n\nTo minimize random variation and more accurately represent long-term dietary habits, the researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs (averaging scores from two prior years). They also made adjustments for potential confounders, including age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nTo analyze the relationship between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, the researchers used Cox proportional-hazard modeling with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nThe results showed that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, is associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 cases of CHD, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the top aMed quintile were found to be at a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The United States faced a severe economic downturn in 2007, characterized by a sharp increase in unemployment and a dramatic collapse of the housing market. This ongoing recession has led to questions about the causes of this crisis and how it can be prevented. In essence, the financial crisis was triggered by misguided and shortsighted policy decisions that pressured banks to issue high-risk sub-prime loans into an already fragile financial system. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two influential mortgage underwriters, were compelled to purchase and repackage these mortgages into complex financial instruments, which eventually became a liability when borrowers defaulted. The banks, lacking sufficient capital reserves, shifted the burden to the repackaged mortgages they had sold and, subsequently, to the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the crisis date back to 1999, when the Clinton administration's goal of securing a second term in office led to relaxed lending regulations. This move set the stage for the subsequent sub-prime crisis seven years later. As reported by Steven Holmes of the New York Times in 1999, Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, was under pressure from the Clinton administration and its shareholders to expand mortgage lending to low- and moderate-income individuals, potentially jeopardizing its financial stability. Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions, warning that the government-subsidized corporation might require a government bailout, akin to the savings and loan industry's rescue in the 1980s.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the proliferation of complex mortgage structures such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These financial instruments entwined various sectors of the economy with the housing market, leaving U.S. households and financial markets vulnerable to even minor fluctuations in property prices. The housing bubble eventually burst, exposing the financial institutions that had invested in these mortgage-backed securities to significant losses. By 2007, the top U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, representing approximately 30% of the U.S. GDP. As a result, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a discount, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to convert to commercial banks with strict regulatory oversight. Fannie and Freddie accumulated $5 trillion in mortgage debt, ultimately necessitating government intervention in September 2008.",
            "Exposition - the part of your story where you take to the skies, flaunting your writing skills, but often leaving your readers yawning or hitting the back button instead. Even seasoned writers like Dr. Merlin have been known to groan at the sight of too much unnecessary information, much to the dismay of their monitor.\n\nExposition is not a friend to writers. While many are familiar with the advice \"Show, don't tell,\" it's a rule that Dr. Merlin finds herself breaking all too often. She knows that exposition can be a snare, luring you into lengthy passages where little happens or worse, nothing of significance unfolds.\n\nAt its core, exposition is about telling the reader what's happened, often in a straightforward manner. It's akin to a character dumping a wealth of information on another in a film or the author doing the same in fiction. A common example of exposition is when a story tells the reader about a character's past, such as their childhood, marriage, or a pivotal event, without showing the essence of these experiences.\n\nConsider a scenario where a story reveals that the heroine met her spouse at a specific time and place, got married, and lost them tragically. You wouldn't expect this sequence to unfold over multiple pages without any meaningful character development. Instead, the author should delve deeper into the husband's character through their dialogue, mannerisms, and actions, allowing the reader to form a connection with them. This would also provide insight into the heroine's character, their relationship, and their emotional growth.\n\nA good story should offer more than just the bare bones of the plot: \"They met, they married, he died.\" As a writer, it's your job to add depth and complexity to these simple events. While it's tempting to rush through exposition, especially when introducing new characters, it's essential to resist this urge. For instance, instead of listing a character's entire life history, background, and interests, consider showing these aspects through their actions, dialogue, and interactions with others.",
            "I watched two breaking news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio on August 13, 2011. The first live news cast was from NBC 4 in the morning. The main story they covered was about a fatal stabbing incident in Ashley, Ohio, where a man named Shad Hostettler allegedly attacked his wife. Although his wife's name was not revealed, her husband's mug shot was displayed, which seemed menacing. The news team devoted around two minutes to this developing story, providing details that the victim had been stabbed multiple times and the perpetrator had been apprehended. I believe they allocated sufficient time for this story.\n\nThe subsequent story reported an early morning shooting incident involving 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured and there were no arrests or suspects at the time. The SWAT team was conducting an investigation. Notably, this story seemed to be brief, and I suspect it might have been due to the fact that the victim was a member of a minority group, as I have observed a pattern of underreporting of crimes involving minority victims. Typically, when a white individual is a victim of a crime, the media gives it extensive coverage, but minority victims often do not receive the same level of attention.\n\nThe news then shifted to a report about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. The details provided suggested the incident occurred in a specific location, and it was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle had hit the aircraft. Crime-Stoppers were offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe following story covered the weather forecast for the upcoming weekend, predicting rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to remain in the mid-to-low eighties. Although the segment was brief, it served as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nAnother story reported a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, approximately six feet tall, and weighing around 150 pounds. I found it striking that the news team emphasized the perpetrator's racial appearance and skin tone extensively.\n\nThe final story featured Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin who had been found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. What caught my attention was the way the news team presented his sentence – instead of stating 25 years in prison, they mentioned \"300 months.\" I am unsure if this was intended to make the sentence sound more severe or if there was another motive behind it. Additionally, the report noted that Rodriguez was a Hispanic man, which seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "A bond between brothers is a powerful and unbreakable connection that encompasses a wide range of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. This unique relationship allows brothers to deeply understand one another, often seeing themselves reflected in their sibling. The complexity of this bond becomes evident in times of crisis, when the true nature of their feelings – whether positive or negative – is revealed. As brothers navigate the consequences of these emotions, they gain insight into their own character through their actions and the outcomes that result from them.\n\nIn the novel \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers delve into the intricacies of this theme, accompanied by the intense emotions that come with it. Set against a vivid backdrop, the two boys embark on a doomed journey that pits bitter disappointment against intense pride in a climactic confrontation, ultimately leaving only one brother alive. The novel explores this theme through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with his brother, as well as the narrator's perspective, which conveys the complex feelings and worldview of the protagonist, both of which significantly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are primarily driven by one dominant emotion: pride. From their initial outings together to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist harbors a deep-seated resentment towards Doodle. His idealized vision of a brother who could share in his experiences and adventures is shattered by Doodle's fragile health, making it unlikely that he would ever be able to participate in physical activities. This crushing reality is compounded by the protagonist's own fantasies, which are slowly deflated as he comes to terms with Doodle's limitations. Although he contemplates harming his brother, the child's smile momentarily rekindles the protagonist's love and compassion, revealing a conflicted inner state. This internal conflict suggests that his initial thoughts were not firmly rooted, and that a deep-seated love for his brother ultimately prevails.",
            "The human brain is a highly intricate and creative system for processing information. Throughout the evolution of technology, the metaphors used to describe the brain have also evolved. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, followed by a sheet of papyrus, then a book, and more recently, a computer. However, it is crucial to remember that these metaphors have limitations and may lead to incorrect conclusions.\n\nThe process of information processing begins with the sensory organs converting physical stimuli into electrochemical signals. These signals are then repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing initially assembles basic information such as color, orientation, and the location of object borders to conclude that you are seeing a box. Subsequently, top-down processing utilizes the decisions made in the bottom-up process to expedite your recognition of the box, allowing you to identify it as a black box rather than a hole in the background.\n\nOnce information has been processed to a certain extent, an attention filter determines the signal's importance and which cognitive processes it should be made accessible to. This is evident in how your brain filters out individual blades of grass when you look down, yet you can focus on your name when spoken in a noisy environment. There are multiple stages of processing, with the results of processing modulated by attention at each stage.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it first needs to store it. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, with different types of encoding suitable for each type of sensory input. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on its structural appearance, phonetic sound, or semantic meaning. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Research on animals suggests that working memory, which retains information for approximately 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal looping through a specific series of neurons for a short duration. In contrast, long-term memory is hypothesized to be preserved in the structure of specific proteins.\n\nThere are numerous theories on how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on human subjects' memory retrieval, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that there are nodes representing concepts, which are connected based on their relationships. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which in turn can be associated with \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the looming threat of technology and its reinforcement by a capitalistic system in his dystopian novel, Brave New World. The novel portrays a society that prioritizes community over individuality, conditioning its citizens to pursue instant gratification above all else. However, beneath this façade, the citizens are mere pawns in a larger game controlled by the World Controller, who dictates a singular ideology. Analyzing the novel through the lens of Marxist theory reveals Huxley's underlying concerns about the development of these systems. The novel incorporates Marxist terminology, such as homogenization and reification, to highlight its commentary on the flaws of the emerging economy during Huxley's time.\n\nThe novel satirizes capitalism by illustrating the concept of false consciousness, where the common citizenry is kept ignorant of their true socioeconomic relationships. They are consumed by a desire for personal gain, a result of the ideological control exerted over the proletariat and working class, as seen in the conditioned people of Brave New World. The lower classes, represented by groups like Delta and Gamma, lack genuine autonomy, as their drive to consume and indulge is artificially strengthened through hypnopædia. This manipulation is orchestrated by the World Controller, exemplifying the concept of hegemony, where a dominant group exercises control over other social classes. The lower classes are oblivious to their manipulation, unwittingly accepting an ideology that perpetuates the capitalist structure. In contrast, the upper classes, represented by Alphas and Betas, are aware of their circumstances but often remain complacent, with few exceptions like Bernard.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between individuals are superficial, and the characters lack depth. This may suggest that the rise of technology and capitalism erodes human free will and self-expression. The novel's portrayal of interactions, often reduced to shallow comments about physical appearance, highlights the absence of genuine emotions and connections. Furthermore, the societal classes' acceptance of their positions in the hierarchy underscores the socioeconomic impact of capitalism, as they conform to their roles and obey the norms of their peers. This illustrates the Marxist concept of the proletariat, who are misled into believing in their own superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for almost three years, which is equivalent to five semesters. For many students, including myself, navigating the campus can be quite challenging. During my first year, I lived in East Halls, which is situated at the easternmost part of campus, excluding the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. The distance between my dorm in Stuart Hall and my classes in buildings like the Willard building, near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes to cover on foot, especially on bad weather days, which are frequent in State College. I spoke to a recent alumnus who shared with me that not long ago, East Halls was separated from the rest of the campus by a large empty area. This vacant space has since been developed with sports fields, new buildings such as the Creamery and the health services building, and surrounding apartments. As the campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another is becoming increasingly difficult. In a college setting, I firmly believe that the most effective solution to this mobility issue is to use bicycles. However, owning a bike alone is not enough; students must be willing to ride them, and the campus infrastructure needs to be designed with the needs of cyclists in mind.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who had recently taken up cycling again after a several-year hiatus. He expressed his surprise that he had stopped cycling in the first place, stating that \"cycling is the best way to get around.\" Besides being beneficial for one's physical health, cycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. Combining a nutritious meal, such as oatmeal, with moderate physical exertion can take you up to 30 miles or more. Like many of my fellow undergraduates, I now reside off-campus, which is just as far from the campus center as some dorms. My decision to purchase a bike has been one of the most practical choices I made this year. Every day, I attend classes in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. However, with my bike, I can reach the building in just 5 minutes if I pedal at a sufficient pace. The only drawback is that Pollock Road, which is the most direct route to Thomas building from my residence, is not always an easy road to navigate, whether by bike or on foot. While walking has its own advantages, I simply don't have the time for it. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would take me an additional 30-40 minutes each day to reach Thomas building. That's over two hours per week, which is a substantial time commitment. Considering the cumulative time spent walking to and from other classes, appointments, and other activities, it would be even more time-consuming. Given my schedule, I couldn't afford to spare that much time."
