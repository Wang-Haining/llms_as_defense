            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "My goal is to pursue a career in social work within the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on helping children who have been abused or neglected, and supporting troubled families. Key values that I will bring to this field include service, respect, an ethical approach, and a commitment to enhancing relationships and continued professional development. These core values are not only essential for social workers but also hold significant importance for me on a personal level.\n\nThroughout my high school and college years, I've always been drawn to helping others, but I wasn't certain about the specific career path I wanted to follow. Observing individuals who struggled with problems and often used inadequate coping mechanisms, I decided to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break, but a life-changing encounter with a troubled teenager that summer led me to reconsider my career path. I met a 16-year-old boy who was visiting his friend to escape an abusive home environment. The next day, he called the police, and I accompanied them to his parents' house, where I expressed my concerns and shared my recent graduation from Piedmont College with a degree in Psychology. The police asked me to talk to the parents, as they were unable to intervene due to legal limitations. When I questioned the parents, they seemed evasive and made excuses for their son's behavior, labeling it as manipulative. This experience sparked my serious consideration of a career in social work, which would allow me to help children resolve conflicts within their families.\n\nSocial justice is another essential value for the field of social work. As a society, we emphasize the importance of the individual but often prioritize conformity over uniqueness. This paradox has always puzzled me. If we mourn the loss of individuals, why do we strive to be like everyone else? I am an individual who refuses to conform to societal norms. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively protested against social injustices, expressing myself through non-traditional fashion choices, advocating for social justice causes, and standing up against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it. I strongly believe in social justice and will continue to advocate for it.",
            "This paper examines the relationship between biological and sociocultural factors in the context of insomnia. The biological model centers on the genetic and medical aspects that contribute to the disorder, such as inherited traits and physiological factors. In contrast, the sociocultural model explores how environmental influences, including demographic and socioeconomic factors, impact an individual's sleep patterns. The forthcoming review of insomnia research will delve into these models, analyzing the selected studies that shed light on and support these theories. The findings of these studies will be critiqued, highlighting their strengths and limitations.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders associated with other mental health conditions, or sleep disorders caused by other factors. The primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias and Parasomnias, while sleep disorders linked to mental health conditions are tied to Axis I or II disorders. Other categories of sleep disorders can arise from medical complications or substance intake. Dyssonmias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Primary Insomnia involves difficulty maintaining adequate sleep, whereas Primary Hypersomnia involves excessive daytime sleepiness, both lasting at least a month. Narcolepsy is characterized by cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. On the other hand, Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral or physiological anomalies. These include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The review focuses on insomnia and its relationship to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model examines the genetic, heritable, and physiological aspects of sleep disorders. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study using mice found that the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons is responsible for sleep-wake states. Activating the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibiting it reduces anxiety and induces sleep. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep duration in the study (Matsuki et al., 2009). The findings suggest that animal models can be applied to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. The absence or malfunction of this receptor could affect an individual's ability to sleep naturally without medication. From a sociocultural perspective, if the receptor's phenotype is inherited, it could influence sleep patterns, and any alterations to the receptor could disrupt sleep, impacting daily life, including academic and professional responsibilities, and routine tasks that require focus and concentration.",
            "This paper explores three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, the disorder is defined, and a clear understanding of its meaning is provided. The next section delves into its diagnosis, highlighting common signs or indicators, also known as \"red flags.\" Finally, the paper concludes by offering practical advice on how a teacher in a mainstream classroom can support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) refers to how efficiently the central nervous system processes auditory information. Essentially, it is a condition where the brain struggles to interpret sounds, despite the person having normal hearing abilities. People with CAPD are not considered deaf or hard of hearing, but they may struggle to distinguish between different sounds, separate background noise from meaningful conversations, or differentiate between words. \n\nThe concept of CAPD originated in the mid-1950s, initially referred to as \"auditory imperception.\" In 1954, Italian researchers began developing tests to identify children with communication disorders, and in 1961, a Japanese researcher introduced a method called dichotic testing to understand the brain's physiology. A national conference in 1977 further sparked research into CAPD.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways, including difficulties with sound localization, recognizing sound patterns, or differentiating changes in speech. Individuals with CAPD may struggle to filter out background noise, understand sarcasm through tone of voice, or follow the sequence of auditory information. They may also experience sound blocking or have difficulty interpreting sounds in a meaningful way. \n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a comprehensive assessment is necessary, which may involve observing listening behaviors and performance on auditory function tests conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals. Various measures are used to evaluate auditory-related skills, including questionnaires, surveys, and observation of auditory responses to certain stimuli. Currently, there is no single, widely accepted diagnostic tool or test for CAPD, and the underlying cause of the disorder remains unknown. Some tests present the patient with multiple sounds simultaneously and ask them to differentiate between them, while more advanced tests involve recording and measuring the brain's response to acoustic signals within the ear.",
            "The play Twelfth Night suggests that while disguises can be useful in deceiving others, they can ultimately lead to a loss of identity if not abandoned. However, giving up a deception can also result in feelings of isolation, as one may be rejected by those who were misled. This leaves individuals with a difficult choice between preserving their own identity and maintaining their relationships with others, who may react negatively to the truth. The issue of deception in Twelfth Night, particularly through gender role reversal, raises additional questions, such as why someone would choose to conceal their true identity and adopt a disguise. For instance, in Viola's case, she felt compelled to disguise herself as a man to protect herself from potential harm after arriving in a foreign land. \n\nThis disguise allowed her to avoid danger but also led to her separation from the support system of women and created complications in her relationships, including Olivia's mistaken attraction to her and suppressed romantic feelings towards Orsino. Although this may seem progressive to modern readers, Twelfth Night can also be seen as a study of how deception can bring suppressed emotions to the surface, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. The play hints at the possibility that these characters may have repressed desires that are revealed through Viola/Cesario's presence. For example, Olivia's switch in affection from Cesario to Sebastian suggests that her initial attraction was superficial and based on appearance, aligning with the societal judgments of Olivia's time. This interpretation is further supported by her eventual shift in perception of Cesario/Viola, viewing her as family rather than a romantic interest.",
            "German colonial rule was marked by brutality, particularly in its treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, the colonial empire's policies and governance varied significantly across its territories, mirroring its diverse geography. This diversity was also reflected in the provision of education, with some colonies experiencing notable success in educating and literate their populations. For instance, when Britain took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a well-educated and literate African population. Similarly, German efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were praised as effective by contemporary observers.\n\nIn stark contrast, South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a drastically different scenario. Unlike East Africa, where the government played a significant role in native education, the task of educating the local population in South West Africa was largely left to missionary societies that received limited government support. Notably, however, the government invested heavily in educating Europeans in the colony, establishing state schools and regulating missionary schools with significant support. This disparity in educational policies had lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule ended. Unlike other German colonies, which boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, the majority of the population in South West Africa remained uneducated and illiterate. Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this disparity.\n\nThis paper seeks to expand the discussion by examining these factors and giving particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans. A wealth of literature exists on education in the German colonial empire, but most of these sources are written in German and focus on describing the features of educational systems. Later studies in English offered comparative analyses of education in the various German colonies, highlighting significant differences in their educational systems. A notable study by Cohen compared the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa, attributing the differences between them to the large settler population in South West Africa. \n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, with a significant portion of the territory being arid desert. This hospitable climate led to a substantial European population, with nearly 15,000 whites residing in South West Africa by 1913, compared to only 5,336 in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population.",
            "Over the past century, the classification of popular music has become increasingly complex due to the proliferation of numerous genres, with many of these genres branching out into multiple sub-genres. This complexity is further exacerbated by the fact that most genres, such as rock, country, jazz, and folk, have spawned numerous sub and sub-sub genres. Among these, the Heavy Metal sub-genre of rock music has emerged as one of the most diverse and expressive in the past 40 years, characterized by its wide range of emotions, predominantly leaning towards the darker end of the emotional spectrum.\n\nIts diversity stems from the early recognition of its flexibility, which allowed artists to create their own sub-genres, followed by sub-sub-genres, and this trend continues to the present day. As a result, the heavy metal movement has branched out into numerous niches, making it challenging to define its core identity. To understand the metal music that exists today, it is essential to grasp the underlying principles and motivations that define the metal movement.\n\nAt its core, the metal movement is characterized by its association with darkness, which can be seen as \"music of excess\" – more emphasis on bass, volume, violence, and theatricality. Musicians in metal bands are highly skilled, evident in their intricate playing styles. Additionally, the movement has a strong connection to the use of psychedelic drugs, which emerged in the 1970s and influenced the creation of avant-garde and otherworldly music. Metal music often incorporates dark and visceral qualities, a departure from the generally lighter tone of popular music. Later generations of metal have drawn inspiration from the Romantic Era's dark and intense qualities. The lyrics of metal songs, such as those in Helter Skelter by the Beatles, exemplify the movement's focus on darkness and the exploration of the human experience.",
            "Before the Surrealist movement emerged, French painter Henri Rousseau was creating works that embodied his own dreams and aspirations. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only captures a woman's wonder at the fantastical world she encounters in her dreams but also reflects Rousseau's internal struggle to balance his desire for recognition with his need for creative freedom. As a painter, Rousseau yearned for the approval of his peers and art enthusiasts, yet he faced an internal conflict: to conform to established styles and gain acceptance from the art world, or to forge his own path and maintain his individuality.\n\nTo understand The Dream, it's essential to know Rousseau's background. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval, northwest France, he came from a relatively affluent family. His father was a successful businessman, but Rousseau himself received no formal art training. Instead, he worked as a municipal toll collector until the age of 40, when he began painting as a way to escape the pain of losing his first wife and eight children. Unlike many of his contemporaries, who romanticized the peasant class, Rousseau's paintings were rooted in his own experiences and the hopes of the ordinary people around him. His quest for acceptance by the art world was fueled by his late start in life and the fact that he began creating art alongside renowned artists like Matisse. As art historian Jan Gordon noted, while both artists were technically competitors, their motivations and styles differed significantly. Matisse sought to avoid clichés in his work, whereas Rousseau aimed to create a conventional piece that would earn him recognition from the prestigious Artiste Français.",
            "The connection between ethics and aesthetics, and truth and beauty, has been a subject of discussion among many prominent thinkers. In my view, this relationship is rooted in a fundamental aspect of human experience. As John Keats poetically conveys in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" beauty and truth are intertwined, and this is all we need to know. While education and experience play a significant role in shaping our understanding of the world, our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seems to be more instinctual, as if we're drawn to them without being explicitly taught. Both ethics and aesthetics are more about describing and explaining concepts rather than providing a set of rules. Our studies of morality and beauty primarily focus on understanding what makes a piece of art or literature beautiful, or an action moral, rather than establishing a set of guidelines for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nMoreover, criticism of art or morals can never fully capture the essence of what is good or beautiful. For instance, a discussion about the Mona Lisa might involve concepts like composition, context, and contrast, but these factors don't fully explain why the painting is considered good art. People often find it difficult to articulate why they love a particular work of art or literature, and they might say something like, \"There's just something about it.\" I believe that art and morals cannot be reduced to a set of descriptive qualities, and both have a transcendent quality that cannot be fully expressed. Flannery O'Connor once said that stories can convey meaning that cannot be put into words, and this is also true for ethics. Ludwig Wittgenstein noted that ethics is transcendental and cannot be expressed. I propose that this ineffable quality is the most powerful aspect of art and morality, and it's this shared transcendent nature that connects them.\n\nI think morality and art are closely related because they both have a profound impact on us at a level that's difficult to put into words. This connection is even stronger in literature, which, as McKean suggests, is distinguished by its moral quality. While moral standards might not be applicable to all art forms, they seem particularly relevant to literature, which is essential to us because of the values it conveys. Living involves values, and literature is a powerful means of exploring and understanding these values.",
            "Germany is a powerful nation with a unique blend of cultures that encompasses the country from the shadows of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel and from Cologne on the Rhine River to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River. This rich cultural heritage is a result of the country's diverse history, shaped by various tribes and influences. \n\nThe term 'Germania' refers to the ancestral homeland of the German people, with its origins being a topic of debate among scholars and historians. According to historical accounts, the name 'Germania' might have originated from the Tungrian tribe or a Germanic tribe that lived before crossing the Rhine River to battle the Gauls. Julius Caesar is credited with using the term 'Germanus' for the first time in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he differentiated between the Gauls he had conquered and the Germanic tribes he had not yet defeated. The term 'Germanus' could be derived from the Gaulish language, referring to a neighboring group, or from the Old Norse word 'ger,' meaning spear, or the Old Irish word 'garim,' meaning 'to shout,' which might describe the loud and boisterous nature of the Germanic tribes.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote extensively about the origins of the Germans in his work 'De Origine et situ Germanorum' around AD 98. According to Tacitus, the Germans were an indigenous people with little to no influence from other cultures. He noted that the Romans did not migrate to Germania, but rather, they visited the region to trade and conquer its resources, while the Germanic tribes engaged in wars with the Romans and other neighboring groups. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the 1st century AD, they interacted with the Roman Empire, trading goods and skills, including serving in the Roman army.",
            "As I gazed downward, my mind was a blank slate, taking in the scene before me without any emotional attachment or analysis.  My thoughts flashed in and out of my consciousness at an incredible pace, leaving no lasting impression.  It was as if my awareness was a fluid, engaged experience, merely observing what lay before me. \n\nAt one point, a friend who was an artist recommended I read \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" to learn about drawing techniques.  I had long been fascinated by drawing since I was six years old, and this book provided a comprehensive guide, covering everything from understanding basic materials to how the brain interprets lines.  One of its key strategies is to frame a picture within a square to simplify its complexities.  For instance, what once appeared as an intricate scene – a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room – can be distilled into a straightforward, simplified image – that same bowl of fruit on a flat surface.\n\nAs I stood before the bowl, I found it impossible to mentally impose this artistic framework.  I was overwhelmed and in awe, unable to do anything but stand there in wonder.  Different artists have their distinct styles, such as Picasso's blue period, Monet's love of greenery, or the Italian Renaissance masters' use of vibrant colors.  If I were to consider myself an artist, this scene before me was the start of my artistic expression, the beginning of \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy hand instinctively reached for the pencil, and as I began to draw, my muscles tensed and relaxed, translating my thoughts into art.  Water droplets and light danced before my eyes, and particles broke away, disappearing into nothingness.  However, my second attempt at drawing was marked by a sudden surge of anxiety, as my hand slapped the handle of the toilet handle in frustration.  Before me lay an unyielding, brown mass that seemed stuck to the bottom of the toilet, an unwelcome gift for the Rite Aid cleaning staff.\n\nWith a mop in hand, my feet shoulder-width apart, and my tie tied uncomfortably tight, I stared at the uninviting, processed matter left behind.  After a few more attempts to flush and moments of introspection, I reached out to grab the roll of toilet paper, wrapping it around my hand like a mitt.  With a slow, deliberate movement, I dipped my mummified hand into the bowl, much like a mother carefully placing a turkey in the oven on Thanksgiving day….",
            "The alarming rate of teenage fatalities behind the wheel is a pressing concern.  Several factors contribute to this tragic statistic, including the fact that the adolescent brain is not fully equipped to handle the risks associated with driving, and the inherent inexperience of young drivers.  This inexperience not only increases the likelihood of fatal accidents but also leads to a higher incidence of rollover accidents, speeding, and driving off the road. \n\nMoreover, when teens drive with their peers, the risk of accidents increases even further.  Research conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center showed a correlation between the age of passengers and the number of traffic accidents.  To address this issue, California and other states have implemented temporary provisional licenses that restrict the hours teens can drive and prohibit minors as passengers.  However, these measures are merely Band-Aid solutions, as the fundamental problem lies in the fact that young drivers, as a group, are statistically unable to adequately manage the risks and responsibilities associated with driving.\n\nExperts, such as psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, argue that even 18-year-olds are not mature enough to handle the demands of driving.  His research suggests that individuals under the age of 19 or 20 have a strong desire for thrill-seeking, which can lead to reckless behavior behind the wheel.  It is logical, therefore, to delay the issuance of driver's licenses until this tendency to take risks has diminished.  If we continue to issue licenses to young teens, we can expect the number of fatal accidents to rise, potentially reaching catastrophic levels.  With the Baby Boomer generation's children soon becoming eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers hitting the roads, the situation is becoming increasingly dire.\n\nA straightforward solution to this issue is to establish a national policy that ensures no one under the age of 18 can operate a vehicle.  Driver's education classes could continue to be provided in schools, and a provisional permit could still be issued before a full license is granted, requiring a certain number of practical driving hours.  The number of hours required could be based on the existing standards set by most states, such as the 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult required in California.  Given that the problem affects drivers across the nation, a uniform, national law would be a reasonable and effective means of protecting young drivers. \n\nMy proposed legislation is not a novel idea, but rather a common-sense solution to a pressing problem.",
            "Upon examining the early films available at the Library of Congress, I decided to review the collection of trick films produced by Edison from 1895 to 1901. This particular subset of films relies heavily on creative editing techniques to create the illusion of something out of nothing. My study primarily focused on analyzing the poetic elements characteristic of most trick films and identifying the distinct features that emerged in some of the later productions. \n\nEarly trick films, which were often set-bound and shot from a fixed position, adhered to a standardized approach that involved using long and medium shots and maintaining a single shot per film. However, there were some groundbreaking films at the beginning of the 20th century that dared to break free from these conventions by incorporating features such as multiple shots. These early films shared a common trait of being shot within an interior set, mimicking the stage setting of a frontal proscenium. The camera remained stationary, never moving to follow characters or objects. This setup was heavily influenced by the theater and vaudeville traditions, where the actors would move laterally, never towards or away from the audience.\n\nOne notable aspect of these early films is the limited movement of actors within the frame. The action in films like \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900) showcases this, where characters enter from one side and move horizontally, staying within the frame. When they exit, the camera remains stationary, not following them off-screen. This composition also led to the minimal use of close-up shots, as the camera would rarely zoom in on a specific detail. Instead, filmmakers relied on long and medium shots, adhering to the traditional theater and vaudeville format where the audience viewed the entire performance from a fixed viewpoint.\n\nThe conventional approach of one shot per film restricted the length of trick films to around a minute or less, depending on the frame rate used. This constraint limited the narrative and dramatic potential of these films, which often focused on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic and disappearing acts, rather than developing a cohesive story. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that a single \"shot\" in a trick film may not always be a single physical shot, but rather a composite of multiple shots cleverly edited together to create an illusion. For example, in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), the physical shot that appears to show Mary's severed head is revealed to be a joined sequence of shots, illustrating the artful manipulation of editing in early film production.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an advocate for the principles of Republicanism, driven by his experiences as an agriculturalist and a brief career in politics. His unwavering commitment to personal freedom and government accountability was a hallmark of his character. His strong agrarian views served as the foundation for his opinions on governance, with a focus on preserving and promoting what he saw as the most superior career path.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a unique opportunity to establish a utopian system, free from the constraints of native traditions that could hinder the development of self-governance. He firmly believed in the inherent rights of individuals, which he considered interdependent and crucial to the well-being of society. He argued that these rights should not be subject to government interference. In his view, the concept of a \"state of nature\" meant that those with physical superiority and malevolent intentions often thrived, but that this should not be the case in a civilized society.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor advocated for a government that acknowledges the duality of human nature, comprising both good and evil. He rigidly adhered to a dualistic morality, stating that a government's virtues and vices are inherently human. He defined virtuous principles as those that protect private property, promote agriculture, and discourage excessive capitalism. Taylor believed that a government grounded in these principles would function equitably, despite the self-interest and avarice that often accompany its administration. He saw self-interest as a natural human motivation, but only considered it evil when it led to the exploitation of others. A good government was necessary to balance human nature, and its principles must be carefully monitored to prevent the introduction of detrimental principles.\n\nLike many Republicans of his time, Taylor championed a strict construction of the Constitution, advocating for a limited federal government with powers explicitly stated in the document. He recognized that a large federal government would be expensive and potentially tyrannical. However, he believed that a literal interpretation of the Constitution, without considering the intent of its authors, could lead to corruption. Furthermore, Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence the true foundation of the United States, as it more explicitly describes the nation as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single entity.",
            "Upon examining Figure 17, a significant drop in commuter log submissions was observed in the third month of the project, which was somewhat disheartening and challenging to explain. The onset of winter at a New England campus likely led to a decrease in bicycle and foot commuting, contributing to this decline. The end of the fall semester in December, coupled with the subsequent holiday season, may have caused the commuter log to fall off the radar for many individuals. Additionally, the prolonged break in late December and early January might have reduced the need for students and faculty to commute to campus. Although classes resumed in late January, the low number of submissions for February remained unexplained. It's possible that the initial enthusiasm for the project naturally waned over time, necessitating strategies to maintain momentum. In response, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a targeted campaign that successfully boosted log submissions for that month. However, sustaining project engagement proved challenging, particularly due to the natural decrease in participation and the added constraints of academic breaks.\n\nOne of the underlying challenges of this project (and similar initiatives) is the widespread preference for personal freedom, independence, and flexibility offered by driving cars. To counter this, it's essential to provide incentives for alternative commuting modes. Throughout the project, we offered gift cards to local businesses, but it would have been intriguing to explore the impact of larger prizes, such as a bicycle, hybrid car, or electric vehicle. This could have potentially mitigated the decline in engagement. The value of the prizes remained constant throughout the project, whereas increasing the prize value over time might have been more effective. Initially, the gift cards seemed sufficient, but announcing additional, higher-value prizes in December (e.g., bicycles) and January (e.g., hybrid or electric cars) could have potentially boosted participation instead of decreasing it.",
            "An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a financial instrument designed to track a specific index, commodity, or collection of assets, similar to an index fund, but with greater flexibility and trading capabilities similar to individual stocks on an exchange.  An ETF offers the diversification benefits of an index fund and the advantages of owning individual stocks, such as short selling, margin buying, and the ability to purchase as few as a single share.  While these benefits are highly appealing, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund.  However, there are some drawbacks, including the requirement to pay commissions for ETF trades, similar to stock transactions.  An additional benefit of ETFs is the wide range of available funds.  To assess the effectiveness of ETFs, it is essential for informed investors to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, actually exist and to what extent.  In this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to determine whether owning a single ETF provides similar benefits to owning a diversified portfolio of the same stocks and whether alternative configurations might offer a more optimal risk-adjusted return.\n\nIn order to simplify the analysis, we have chosen to focus on the top 10 holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets.  We will use the current asset allocation to estimate the contribution of each stock to a portfolio's beta and return if the portfolio were comprised solely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF.  The calculations of beta and return are presented in the following chart.\n\nFrom the chart, it is clear that a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns.  Moreover, the beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF's beta.  Preliminary results suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide higher returns with a lower risk.  Nevertheless, it is possible that the means of the two portfolios may not be statistically different.\n\nTo further assess the statistical difference between these portfolios, we calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, to compare their combined standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" is considered one of his superior works. In this poem, Poe employs the term \"Thulé,\" which has its roots in Virgil. However, it's also tied to a more contemporary source, given Poe's interest in German literature, particularly the works of Goethe. Karl J. Arndt notes the similarity between Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon,\" suggesting that Poe may have been influenced by the latter.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature highlights Goethe's notable work, \"Faust,\" a poetic drama published in two parts, with the second part being released in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Within \"Faust,\" there's a poem called \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells the story of a king who, after his wife's passing, descends into heavy drinking and grief. This character's behavior parallels the description of the king in Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" which can be seen as a dark reflection of the narrator's own struggles with loss and his reliance on drinking. Interestingly, a romantic drama adaptation of \"Faust\" was published in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term Thulé in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe references Thulé twice in his collected works, using the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and employing it as a bookend in \"Dream-Land.\" The two works can be seen as complementary pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a desolate and colorless world, haunted by the presence of deceased friends, much like the King of Thulé, who has lost his wife and is struggling to find purpose.\n\nPoe's familiarity with Goethe's work is also evident through his admiration for Alfred Tennyson, another notable author. Poe's statement on Tennyson suggests that he would have been exposed to Goethe's work through various reproductions and adaptations that were prevalent after the original publication of \"Faust.\"",
            "Under California law, if a customer slips and falls in a grocery store due to an applesauce spill, they might be eligible to receive punitive damages if the store manager was reckless and acted with malicious intent. A judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages without a thorough examination. To justify an award of punitive damages, Palmer must provide evidence that the store manager's actions were taken with a deliberate disregard for the potential harm caused, and that his conduct was reprehensible. Palmer can argue that the manager, Paul Martin, should have known about the potential harm of not cleaning the spill, given that multiple customers had already slipped and fallen at the store in the months preceding Palmer's accident. Additionally, Palmer can argue that Martin's inaction was inexcusable, considering that he had been informed of the spill twice, yet chose to ignore it because he was on dinner break. Although Palmer's claim of Martin's despicable actions may be less convincing, it is still a reasonable argument given the fact that several slip-and-fall incidents had occurred at the store in 2009, and Martin failed to take necessary measures to maintain the store's safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about the applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin responded by stating he was on dinner break and couldn't deal with customer complaints. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin of the spill, but he responded with the same excuse. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, suffering a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, there had been five reported slip-and-fall incidents at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering filing a motion for partial summary judgment on the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The statute defines malice as conduct intending to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when it was committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, where the defendant was aware of the probable consequences of his actions and deliberately failed to avoid them.",
            "It's been almost four years since I took a course on Islam at CBC, and one of the topics that still resonates with me is whether Islam is a hostile religion or not. In my opinion, this question is more relevant today than ever, especially considering the changing media portrayal of Islam in America since 9/11. The fact that a presidential candidate with an obvious Muslim background, such as Barack Obama, was viable in 2008 is a stark contrast to the hostile views that dominated the media in 2001.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad has left an impression on me, as it contrasts with my initial understanding of his history. I had previously believed that Muhammad forced people to convert to Islam, but the biography portrays him as a misunderstood figure who was humble and merciful. According to the account, people were drawn to his teachings, not coerced, and they came to see the truth in his words voluntarily.\n\nInterestingly, there are similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles attributed to Muhammad. For instance, Muhammad's multiplication of food to feed forty men is strikingly similar to the miracles of Jesus. This style of storytelling has made me wonder whether the authors aimed to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove himself, but instead lived a life of truth and miracles. However, this narrative approach downplays the significance of Jesus Christ's life and miracles, making it seem like Muhammad's story is an attempt to co-opt or borrow from Jesus' narrative.\n\nAnother aspect that troubled me about the biography is the reliance on third-party accounts to prove the truth of the stories. While the intention behind this method may have been to provide evidence, it actually diminishes the credibility of the stories and raises suspicions. Furthermore, the portrayal of Muhammad as a gentle and humble man is at odds with historical records, which portray him as a more complex figure. I worry that Muslims today may not be aware of the full history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The Christian teachings and beliefs that Jesus held during his lifetime were initially set aside as Christianity evolved following his passing.  Looking at the broader picture, it's clear that Christianity has drifted further and further from its roots over time.  Today, there's a growing awareness and a progressive shift in the world, particularly among traditional individuals who resist any departure from the original teachings.  However, their influence may not be substantial enough to dictate the course of the religion as a whole.  In the future, a heightened awareness of history among Christians will emerge, and there will be a growing desire to distinguish the doctrines developed over time from Jesus' original intentions.  This reversal will eventually lead to a significant shift in Christian history, as a movement gains momentum, stripping away layers of added doctrine, returning to the core principles Jesus introduced, untainted by the ideas of later thinkers.  This trend will spread across the United States and Europe, influencing the masses, who will return to worshipping in a manner reminiscent of Jesus' time, adhering to his original ideas.  The church as an institution will remain strong, guiding this movement, but the outcome will be a unified, more homogeneous Christian community, with reduced diversity.  As we look at human history, we see that reversals are not uncommon, such as the shift from persecution to the Roman Empire embracing Christianity, or the transformation of the United States from African-American slavery to leadership.  A similar reversal is expected to unfold in the Christian faith, seeking its roots and undoing the diversity that has developed over time.  Crucially, this process will be facilitated by reinterpreting Jesus' words as metaphors rather than literal statements.  To understand this development, we must look back to the earliest roots of Christianity, which originated in Judaism.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., Judaism was already a complex faith with monotheism, divinely revealed scripture, and Hebrew authority at its core.  The Jewish population was not a unified entity, with various groups like Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and common people existing alongside one another.",
            "I firmly believe that beneath the surface, human nature is driven by self-interest and a focus on personal gain. People tend to prioritize their own well-being over others, often disregarding the needs and well-being of those less fortunate. The novel \"The Jungle\" by Upton Sinclair vividly portrays this selfish aspect of human nature through its depiction of the factory owners and managers. These individuals are solely concerned with expanding their businesses and amassing wealth, without regard for the consequences or the harm caused to others. As Sinclair illustrates, the factories' pollution and environmental impact are starkly visible, with massive smokestacks emitting pollutants and animal waste from the overcrowded conditions of the pens.\n\nThe factory owners and managers also exploited their employees, treating them as mere commodities to be used and discarded. They were willing to do whatever it took to increase their profits, even if it meant pushing their workers to their limits and beyond. The novel paints a bleak picture of a system where workers were not valued as individuals, but rather as replaceable assets. The absence of labor laws and regulations during the era enabled the factory owners to operate with impunity, forcing workers to toil in hazardous conditions without any protection or support. The working-class individuals living in Packingtown were expected to endure the harsh conditions of their lives, with no access to resources or organizations that could aid them.\n\nThe labor unions, which were intended to provide support to workers, often ended up perpetuating the system of exploitation. They profited from the struggles of the working-class individuals, further entrenching their exploitation. As a result, the workers were trapped in a cycle of poverty and oppression, described by Sinclair as a form of modern-day slavery. This situation led to widespread immorality and desperation, mirroring the conditions of the old chattel slavery system.",
            "When writing, many authors attempt to evoke a particular sentiment or attitude in their readers towards significant subjects. Some techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs a range of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. One such method involves combining an adjective and a noun in an unconventional way to create a distinct aura around a subject. Another technique is assigning meaning to a symbol and then utilizing it to convey a specific feeling. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald frequently employs the latter technique with various colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. \n\nFitzgerald establishes meaning for colors, particularly white/gray, and later leverages this meaning to evoke a particular feeling in relation to a crucial object. The meaning he creates for white/gray is related to uniformity, with white being associated with a sense of refinement and higher social standing, while gray is linked to something older and faded. \n\nAt the beginning of the novel, Fitzgerald sets up this meaning by consistently using both colors. Characters such as Daisy and Jordan are frequently depicted wearing white, while the narrator, Nick, observes that everyone at a party is dressed in white. However, the only time this is not the case is when Nick is describing his initial impressions of Gatsby's party, where the atmosphere is described as gaudy with primary colors. Fitzgerald further reinforces these color associations by applying them to ordinary, unremarkable subjects, such as buildings and people. He describes Nick's daily commute to work as traveling through \"white chasms of lower New York,\" and the names of people at Gatsby's party appear as \"gray names\" on Nick's schedule. He also uses white or gray to describe ordinary people or places, like Jordan and Daisy's shared \"white girlhood\" or the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes. \n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established the meaning of white/gray, he uses them to signify a lack of importance or uniformity in certain subjects. This technique begins with the character of Daisy. After a period of relative absence from these colors, Fitzgerald begins to associate Daisy with white, portraying her as dressed in a \"little white roadster.\" This depiction reduces Daisy to a uniform, almost anonymous figure, someone Gatsby longs for but does not truly understand. Fitzgerald employs this technique repeatedly to reinforce the idea that Daisy is more of an idealized concept than a fully fleshed-out character, as seen in her wearing a \"gray haze of fur collar\" or another \"white\" dress before the encounter between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County's favorable climate allows for a thriving agricultural sector, with a variety of crops being cultivated, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, and peppers. The region has a strong demand for organic, community-supported agriculture food, resulting in long waiting lists for local organizations. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Many organic farms in the area offer tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. By adopting organic farming practices, landowners can benefit from government programs while also preserving and enhancing the local ecosystem.\n\nIn addition to catering to a lucrative niche market, organic farming brings several environmental benefits, such as increased biodiversity and a healthier environment, due to the absence of chemical use in farming. However, organic farming comes with higher costs and labor requirements compared to conventional farming, as it demands more intensive labor and management to control pests, weeds, and soil fertility without the use of chemicals. Organic farms often face greater losses and lack the efficiency of large-scale operations. Furthermore, practices that benefit wildlife, such as planting cover crops, rotational grazing, and invasive species removal, can also incur higher labor costs. As a result, landowners may seek financial assistance or expert guidance to maximize both profits and environmental quality.\n\nThe selected land parcel is situated in unincorporated San Diego County, California, adjacent to the town of Potrero, and comprises 160 acres of chaparral, Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. The East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan protects over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and several butterfly species, while others are declining and may soon be listed, including the burrowing owl.\n\nThis area has been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries and was later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. As part of an original homestead patent, the land was likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many years. To explore the possibilities for a small farmer in this region, a piece of property was selected from a real estate website, and relevant government programs were researched to identify potential cost-saving options and wildlife-friendly practices. An existing organic farm in the same area served as a model for this hypothetical scenario.",
            "Culture holds significant weight in the negotiation process. Culture encompasses a broad spectrum of characteristics, which are often defined by what they lack or signify rather than their inherent nature. It is crucial to recognize that culture is not a uniform or singular entity, but rather a complex and multifaceted aspect of human experience. Making generalizations about a culture, such as labeling an entire nation as stubborn or accommodating, oversimplifies the complexities involved. Instead, a more effective approach for a negotiator is to comprehend the nuances of a culture's values and how they impact the negotiation at hand. \n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture requires a multifaceted approach, encompassing its history, values, and even its potential biases. Rather than judging or attempting to alter a culture, it is essential to accept and work within its boundaries, particularly when in a weaker negotiating position. When negotiating in a foreign environment, respecting local traditions and customs can facilitate a smoother transition and help overcome cultural barriers. \n\nIt is worth noting that cultural boundaries do not strictly follow national or international lines. Organizational cultures within a nation can exhibit unique characteristics, such as varying work hours, communication styles, or hiring practices. For instance, some companies prioritize work-life balance, while others emphasize long working hours. By examining these differences, we can appreciate the diversity of thought within a given culture. Even within a seemingly uniform culture, there may be more to discover beneath the surface. \n\nUnderstanding core values is vital, as they provide insight into the underlying motivations and driving forces behind a culture. In cultures where saving face or maintaining harmony is highly valued, a negotiator will not publicly criticize their company or superiors to achieve a positive outcome. Conversely, in cultures that prioritize aggressive negotiations, a hard bargain is more likely. Considering these cultural nuances before entering a negotiation can greatly increase its effectiveness. However, it is also essential to establish a personal connection with the opposing party to create a more successful negotiation outcome.",
            "The phrase \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" originates from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible and serves as the starting point for St. Anselm's argument on the existence of God. Similarly, Thomas Aquinas also expresses this belief, which is why we will compare and contrast their arguments to determine whose is more convincing. To ensure a fair comparison, we will assume they both believe in the God of the Bible, as a hypothetical, non-Christian God would not be directly comparable. While both authors present valid points, neither provides a comprehensive foundation for faith in God.\n\nTo illustrate this point, let's examine St. Anselm's argument first. He emphasizes the role of introspection in understanding God, suggesting that the existence of God can be found within one's own mind. Anselm's idea is that our understanding of God is innate, and we don't need external evidence to prove it. This concept is often referred to as faith, where one accepts something as true without concrete empirical evidence. \n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas proposes that the existence of God can be logically proven through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith. This approach has practical implications for evangelism, as it allows potential converts to be persuaded by logic rather than relying on faith. Aquinas provides five distinct logical arguments to demonstrate the necessity of God's existence: the arguments of change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. These arguments demonstrate that the existence of God is a logical necessity, analogous to a missing puzzle piece that can be inferred from the rest of the puzzle without being seen directly.",
            "In the 5th or 6th century BCE, a future Buddha was born, who would later be known as the Buddha. Over the course of his life, he renounced worldly life and achieved enlightenment, leading to the establishment of Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being its most traditional form. This ancient religion, which is approximately 2500 years old, has undergone significant changes since the Buddha's time, as seen in countries like Sri Lanka, where the Theravada nation observes the water-cutting ceremony, a tradition that does not have its roots in the Buddha's teachings. These differences in traditions and core principles can be observed in both the monastic and lay communities of Theravada Buddhism, and have evolved due to a mix of internal and external factors, including both hostile and benign influences.\n\nTo facilitate this discussion, certain key terms will be used frequently. Internal forces refer to changes driven by Buddhist members, regardless of their monastic status, whereas external forces originate from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces aim to harm the Buddhist community, often fueled by a negative perception of the religion, whereas benign forces do not intend to harm or help, but may inadvertently do so. These terms will be used repeatedly in this discussion.\n\nTo begin, it's essential to understand the foundational principles of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the Triple Gem, consisting of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is comprised of the Tripitaka, which includes three collections of texts: the Sutta Pitaka (containing the Suttas), the Vinaya Pitaka (laying out disciplinary rules), and the Abhidhamma Pitaka (covering metaphysical aspects of Buddhism). Key metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these principles is crucial to ending Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, along with the cessation of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), which occur when one achieves enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for living, with five precepts for laymen (non-harming, non-deception, non-theft, non-misbehavior, and non-intoxication) and additional rules for monks. The Four Noble Truths form the central doctrine of Buddhism, stating that life is marked by suffering (Dukkha), that attachment causes suffering, and that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico represent a case study of a 57-year-long rivalry, spanning from 1836 to 1893, marked by periodic clashes and tensions between the two nations. The conflict reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, which resulted in the United States' victory and its acquisition of Texas and the American Southwest. This prolonged rivalry was fueled by fundamental differences in values, customs, and interests, as well as historical grievances, including a clash of material interests. \n\nThis scenario is not unique, as neighboring countries often experience similar rivalries due to shared border disputes and competing interests. The U.S.-Mexico relationship shares similarities with other enduring rivalries between border-sharing nations. Historian David M. Pletcher observed that the United States has faced long-standing diplomatic challenges in Mexico and Cuba, largely due to their geographical proximity and historical tensions. \n\nReligious differences were a significant factor in the U.S.-Mexico conflict, echoing a recurring theme throughout history. As Sally Frahm noted, the United States has historically been wary of Catholicism and monarchy, mirroring the ideological divisions seen in the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. This mistrust was inherited from the historical animosity between the English and Spanish, which hindered the establishment of friendly diplomatic relations between the two nations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts documented 17 disputes between the United States and Mexico during the 57-year period of rivalry. Most of these conflicts centered on territorial issues, including border raids and frontier problems, which persisted until both countries deployed military force along their borders. As historian Schmitt noted, the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States and the U.S. shifted its focus from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico during the latter part of the 19th century.",
            "It's been 15 years since an unexpected illness left me disabled, stripping away my career as a nurse and the security I had worked towards since childhood. I had become a nurse to ensure a stable future, as I had been repeatedly told, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" However, this mantra fell apart when I was 46, single, and without savings. To this day, I rely on Social Security Disability, and the little I had is now gone. Each day is a struggle, constantly threatening my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Yet, I've come to realize that my family and close friends have been my lifeline, and I couldn't have survived without them.\n\nMy experience has taught me that emergencies can strike anyone, big or small. No matter how prepared we think we are, there are some challenges we simply cannot overcome alone. In the US, it's clear that we've become too reliant on the government to solve our problems, but I believe that learning to trust and help one another would be a more effective solution.\n\nThe idea of rugged individualism, often emphasized by conservatives, is a misconception. Our ancestors didn't rely on self-reliance to survive during hard times; it was their compassion, mutual respect, and resource sharing that kept them going. The pioneers who crossed the country in wagon trains didn't achieve their goal alone.\n\nWhile it's essential to be prepared, having a disaster kit or a small farm can only take you so far. True resilience comes from building relationships with those around you, particularly your neighbors. By getting to know them, you'll create a network of support that can help you navigate life's challenges, making a difference in your ability to cope with difficulties.",
            "The mechanisms behind the evolutionary process and the constraints that influence the direction of change are still not fully understood. Although D'Arcy Thompson proposed the idea of using mathematical language to describe organic forms as early as 1917, this concept remains a subject of ongoing study. Recent applications of mathematical modeling have focused on the development and evolution of mollusk skeletons, especially in terms of ontogeny and phylogeny. Our research aims to explore how mathematical modeling in combination with experimental studies can help us understand the underlying mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental changes in the genus Prunum. To achieve this, we have analyzed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that can be used to model and predict hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell, allowing us to create hypothetical shell morphologies that can be used to determine the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. Our findings will be integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to provide a deeper understanding of macroevolutionary events within this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a spiral structure that moves through 360 degrees of space over time. The individual turns or coils of the shell are referred to as whorls, which are thought to rotate around a central axis, known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls grow can vary, and a continuous line divides each whorl, called a suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the last one, known as the body whorl. The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last, while the apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal exits its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nFrom different perspectives, shells can be viewed in apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. The standard orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count the whorls of a shell, one should first view it from the apical perspective and determine the starting point of the first suture. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell, and whorls can be counted from this line, estimating each whorl to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal builds its shell. By tracking the path of the aperture using the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture, it is possible to graphically and mathematically represent this trajectory. Once a mathematical formulation is established, it is then possible to manipulate parameters and modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia has seen little progress in reducing neonatal and infant mortality rates. Although the country is on track to meet several Millennium Development Goals, such as improving access to water and sanitation, its child and maternal health targets are far from being met. To address these shortcomings, a closer examination of the healthcare system is necessary rather than focusing solely on program-specific interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made some progress in increasing the number of births attended by skilled healthcare professionals, with 72% of births now meeting this target. However, this figure includes traditional practitioners, such as midwives, who may not be equipped to handle complications during pregnancy, which contributes to a significant number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. This improvement may be misleading, highlighting the need for further action. Furthermore, there has been a decline in the percentage of children under five years old treated by a healthcare professional for diarrheal cases, and postnatal care data remains incomplete, revealing concerns across the country.\n\nThe cesarean-section rate remains lower than expected at around 4%, and this rate also underscores another pressing issue. The rate of cesarean-sections varies significantly between urban and rural areas, standing at 7% and 2% respectively, indicating a disparity in healthcare access across the country. Moreover, the gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles is substantial, with a 27% difference, suggesting that the poor face significant barriers in accessing healthcare due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nConsidering the next steps for improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the key question revolves around how to effectively address the lack of healthcare services. The question is whether Indonesia should prioritize strengthening its overall health system or adopt program-specific approaches without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children. While programmatic approaches may be appealing due to their targeted objectives and faster results, they also have drawbacks. Investing heavily in one area may divert resources from other areas and create a surge in human resources towards the more funded sector, as seen in the case of HIV/AIDS and family planning. Moreover, running multiple parallel programs can lead to duplication and disorganization of services, increasing administrative burdens and paperwork.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous depiction of the aristocracy during that time period.  Two novels that diverge from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both works employ an element of mystery and an unconventional tone, which helps to enrich the characters within each story, offering deeper insights into their motivations and emotions.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, for instance, the protagonist's inner turmoil is often revealed through dream sequences or trance-like states. These unusual events provide a glimpse into Oliver's inner world, revealing the pain and unease he experiences due to his surroundings. When Oliver relives the shooting scene in chapter 28, it's as if he's reliving it in a dream, symbolizing his loss of control over the events that unfolded. The passage emphasizes Oliver's vulnerability, as his senses are dulled and he's unable to notice the force that's transporting him away from the scene. This event reinforces the notion that Oliver's fate is not entirely in his hands, and that he's subjected to forces beyond his control. This sense of powerlessness is further highlighted by Oliver's inability to take action to change his circumstances, even when his life is at risk. It's implied that his experiences have led to a growing sense of defeat, as if he's been broken by the hardships he's faced, leaving him without the will to resist or take control.\n\nIn a similar vein, Wuthering Heights features a dreamlike narrative that blurs the lines between reality and fantasy. The passage from Wuthering Heights describes a scene where the protagonist is overwhelmed by a cacophony of sounds and visuals, leaving him disoriented and struggling to make sense of his surroundings. The experience is characterized by an undefined sense of pain and unease, which persists and torments him relentlessly. This dreamlike state is a recurring theme in both novels, used to explore the characters' inner worlds and emotional struggles.\n\nThe use of dream sequences in these novels serves to highlight the characters' lack of agency and their vulnerability to external forces. By blurring the lines between reality and fantasy, the authors create a sense of uncertainty and ambiguity, leaving the reader questioning the nature of reality and the characters' place within it. This narrative technique also allows the authors to delve deeper into the characters' emotions and motivations, providing a more nuanced understanding of their experiences and the world they inhabit.",
            "It has been a few years since I worked in an after-school program where I tutored elementary school students. I made it my goal to assist them in any subject they struggled with, but my strengths were in English and reading. I was approached by an instructor to work with a boy named Adrian, who was having trouble reading. At first, I noticed something peculiar - he could pronounce certain letters flawlessly, but struggled with others. It wasn't until I met Adrian's mother that I realized the source of the issue: he knew the English alphabet, but not its pronunciation. This experience has stuck with me and serves as a reminder of the language barrier in schools, particularly in California. It highlights that even children who speak perfect English can face significant challenges with reading.\n\nI share this story to emphasize the issue of language barriers in schools and to demonstrate that it's not always as apparent as we think. Even children who speak English fluently can struggle with reading. This problem is a common challenge that everyone agrees exists. In Adrian's case, his issue was relatively simple to address: additional tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children who barely speak English, the solution is far more complex. There is no single answer, but rather a combination of approaches. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, or other methods alone will not solve this problem. Instead, the key lies in implementing a combination of these strategies.\n\nThe dual language system is a promising approach that can benefit not only children who speak Spanish as their first language but also all children. Research has shown that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns that this approach is resource-intensive and only benefits a small percentage of students, the evidence contradicts this claim. If implemented widely, this approach could benefit all students. To achieve this, we don't need all teachers to be bilingual, which is unrealistic and impractical. However, we can still utilize bilingual aids, tutors, or other support staff to help bridge the language gap.",
            "From a young age, many of us are taught there is something greater than ourselves, something we can't fully comprehend.  Some attend church, temple, or other faith-based institutions to learn about it, while others seek answers within themselves.  Many people accept the faith they were raised with, but some reject the idea of anything beyond their own understanding.  We may adopt a set of values as children, only to change them later as we grow and mature.  No matter which path we choose, we strive to define ourselves through our unique perspectives on spirituality.  We seek guidance and a sense of direction in life.\n\nOne afternoon, my father shared with me the bird he loved the most, the cardinal, while we sat on our front porch during a rainstorm.  As we smoked, the rain pounded against the tin roof above, and the downspouts carried the water down, drowning the plants beside us.  My father stared out into the rain, lost in thought, his eyes displaying a mix of searching and reminiscing.  He'd been struggling with his health, and his appearance had changed significantly.  We avoided eye contact, and I felt a deep sense of isolation, fear, and the inability to discuss my impending loss with him.  I sought comfort by hugging him, sitting down beside him, and gazing out into the rain alongside him.\n\nMy father passed away in December, just five days after my 22nd birthday.  The treatments had prolonged his life beyond the projected timeframe, but they only increased his suffering.  I couldn't understand the purpose of prolonging his pain.  In the silence of the night, I stopped praying, as I questioned whether a higher power had ever truly listened to me. \n\nI chose not to watch my father's final moments, unable to bear the thought of witnessing the life that shaped me come to an end.  I preferred to remember my father through the happy memories, not the sorrow of his passing.  I was convinced that he wouldn't have wanted me to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball on my bed for three days, waiting to hear the news.  Unfortunately, no one even called me to offer their condolences.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is inherently contradictory, as it combines the concepts of 'old' and 'new,' as described by Ian Watt in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been met with mixed reactions, ranging from criticism for its perceived lack of depth to praise for its ability to evoke a sense of the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The origin of the Gothic genre can be attributed to Horace Walpole's novel The Castle of Otranto, which drew inspiration from both ancient and modern romance styles to create a new form of literary expression. Walpole's work incorporated elements of medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions, blending them with the novel's modern format to create a unique storytelling experience. At the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication, the term \"Gothic\" was associated with outdated or unsophisticated concepts, as society and literature were advancing. The combination of Gothic elements and the novel's format, which allowed readers to gain a more intimate understanding of characters' psychology, contributed to the genre's enduring appeal and ability to seem both outdated and new to readers from different eras.\n\nThe concept of chivalry is a prominent theme in Gothic novels, including The Castle of Otranto. The medieval ideal of chivalry, which emphasized the qualities of a noble knight, such as bravery, honor, and competence, was retained and reinterpreted in the original Gothic novel. Chivalry held significant importance for Gothic writers like Walpole, as it represented an idealized and romanticized notion of the past, hinting at the future development of the Romantic movement. Through the use of chivalric concepts and mannerisms, the Gothic past was glorified, aiming to improve the present. Walpole, writing during a tumultuous period in history, was skeptical about the morality and goodness of his contemporaries, as seen in his portrayal of characters like Frederic. This character embodies many chivalric traits, including his status as a prince, his experience of tragedy, and his supposed heroism. The description of Frederic as a gallant and courteous knight is an exaggerated representation, which introduces the Gothic trope of excess, highlighting the genre's inclination towards over-the-top storytelling.",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the comprehensive process of moving goods from the initial customer order through various stages, including raw materials, production, supply, and distribution to the end customer. The concept of supply chain management was introduced by Keith Oliver, a consultant, in 1982. According to Keith Oliver, it involves planning, implementing, and controlling all aspects of the supply chain to meet customer needs efficiently and effectively. The supply chain comprises six critical components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information.\n\nBusiness managers utilize these six key elements to deliver exceptional customer service. Production is the foundation of the supply chain process, requiring careful planning of 'what,' 'when,' 'where,' and 'how' to produce products. Understanding customer demands is crucial for production planning, and this can be achieved by analyzing market trends, which serve as a significant indicator of customer needs. Once market analysis is complete, managers can decide on the products to produce, their quantities, and the optimal production location to meet customer expectations. This decision-making process also involves scheduling workloads, equipment maintenance, and ensuring that production aligns with customer satisfaction.\n\nEvery detail in the production process is vital, and any misstep can result in significant time and financial losses for the company in the long run. A well-structured process, as seen in companies like Wal-Mart and Target, which have established detailed guidelines for various aspects of their business, helps prevent confusion and ensures a smooth workflow. The second essential element of supply chain management is supply, which involves making strategic decisions to determine a company's core capabilities and identify potential outsourcing partnerships. This may involve dividing production into various divisions, each with specialized equipment, workers, and expertise. Outsourcing certain tasks to other companies can help achieve velocity – the ability to provide quality, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness – while maintaining low costs.",
            "The sign held by Ellen Page, star of the film Juno, bears a haunting message: 'Hitler is alive in Burma.'  The statement is a reference to the country now known as Myanmar, a Southeast Asian nation ruled by a ruthless military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, the country witnessed a wave of street protests, dubbed 'The Saffron Revolution,' as thousands of Burmese monks took to the streets, donning their distinctive orange robes. Although the government initially allowed the peaceful demonstrations, the situation quickly escalated into violence, with the military cracking down on the monks and foreign journalists, resulting in the tragic death of a Japanese photojournalist. Estimates of the death toll vary, with some sources suggesting that the true number of fatalities may be in the thousands.\n\nThis is a recurring theme throughout history, where governments have consistently sought to suppress dissent and maintain control over their citizens. From ancient Rome's autocratic rulers to modern-day leaders, the desire for absolute power has been a persistent pattern. Notable examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, where the government brutally suppressed a gathering of intellectuals, activists, and students, and the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, in which Hutu militia groups, backed by the government, systematically targeted Tutsis and moderate ethnic groups. Another infamous example is the Nazi regime's 'Third Reich,' where millions of people, particularly those of Jewish descent, were rounded up and killed. These events serve as stark reminders of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of protecting human rights and freedoms.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting impact on jazz can be attributed to his remarkable longevity and exceptional ability to shape his orchestra creatively. Although he often played subtly on the piano in many of his compositions, as a composer, Ellington excelled at crafting intricate, complex pieces that showcased the unique talents of each band member. By designing a framework that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also writing tightly orchestrated passages that highlighted the distinct styles of individual musicians, Ellington achieved a coherent and original sound for each piece. His mastery of the unique timbres of his players, combined with his understanding of how they blended together in an ensemble, enabled him to create some of the most innovative and brilliant jazz pieces in history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes Ellington's innovative approach to incorporating the voice as a jazz instrument, exemplified in his early work \"Creole Love Call.\" This piece demonstrates Ellington's ability to use the human voice to add texture and color without relying on lyrics, setting it apart from other musical forms. The song features a slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues structure with six distinct choruses. These choruses showcase Ellington's skill in combining different musical elements, including call-and-response patterns, soloists, and instrumental textures.\n\nIn \"Creole Love Call,\" the first chorus features a call-and-response exchange between the voice and reeds, which transitions from smooth to rough. The second chorus features a muted trumpet solo that expands on the melody, emphasizing extended notes. The third chorus showcases a clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle piano phrase with syncopated rhythms. The fourth chorus has the full band echoing the first chorus, with call-and-response interactions between the brass and reed sections. The fifth chorus is climactic, with the reeds initiating the call-and-response pattern in a high register, accompanied by syncopated rhythms from the brass and rhythm sections. The sixth and final chorus returns to the structure of the first, with call-and-response between the voice and reeds, this time featuring the voice using the \"growl\" technique to solo like an instrument. A brief tag concludes the piece with a vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending.\n\nEllington's use of the human voice to add tonal depth to his compositions is a recurring theme throughout his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year after \"Creole Love Call,\" Ellington combines his skill in arranging complex orchestral textures with his sensitivity to tonal color. The call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich and complementary sound by combining vocal and instrumental elements. In \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" Ellington leverages the unique talent of Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a prominent member of his orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone, further showcasing his ability to bring out the best in his musicians.",
            "She had a persistent feeling of incompleteness that began when she was 14 and had continued for three years. It wasn't until she turned 17 that she realized she was looking for a romantic connection rather than a material one. Despite her age, she found herself uninterested in any of the boys she encountered. She frequently questioned why she felt this way, but her introspection couldn't provide a clear explanation. As a result, she continued to go about her life, often pondering her desires.\n\nOn a typical day at home, her parents were known for their calm demeanor and infrequent arguments. In fact, the only disagreements they had were about her strong will and independent nature, which often clashed with their laid-back personalities. She was a lively and likable person who balanced out her parents' calmness. However, this day was different. While searching for new ideas, she was startled by a loud cry and the distress in her mother's voice coming from the kitchen. Rushing to the scene, she frantically asked, \"Mom, what's wrong?\" and found her mother lying on the ground in pain. She quickly put a hand on her mother's shoulder to offer support and asked her to clarify the situation. Her mother, struggling to speak, managed to utter, \"I need you to take me to the hospital.\" Realizing her mother was in severe pain, she offered to drive her and carefully helped her mother into the car. \n\nThe hospital's sterile atmosphere was filled with the scent of disinfectant and the air of concern. Despite the sense of unease that surrounded her, the daughter's focus was solely on her mother. She swiftly carried her into the hospital and called for medical assistance.

It turned out that her mother had fallen off a step stool while trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "The study aimed to assess the relationship between adherence to a Mediterranean Diet, as reflected in an \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" and the risk of chronic heart disease and stroke. This diet is characterized by high consumption of plant-based foods, such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, as well as monounsaturated fats and fish, and lower intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is also allowed.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that adhering to the Mediterranean Diet is associated with a lower risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, and an intervention trial found it to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving cholesterol levels in obese individuals. However, research on the specific link between the Mediterranean Diet and stroke mortality has been limited.\n\nThe study in question followed a cohort of 74,886 women aged 38-63 without a history of heart disease or diabetes, who were part of the Nurses' Health Study. Over a 20-year period from 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score six times, using self-reported food frequency questionnaires that assessed nutrient intake over the past year. The questionnaires were validated through multiple studies, and reports of heart disease, stroke, and other health outcomes were confirmed through medical records and other official documents. When records were not available, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included in the analysis, representing about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal heart attacks.\n\nThe analysis controlled for various factors that could influence the results, such as body mass index, smoking status, physical activity, and medication use. To minimize individual variability and accurately represent long-term dietary habits, the researchers averaged the aMed scores from repeated questionnaires. The study used Cox proportional-hazard modeling to assess the relationship between the aMed score and the risk of heart disease and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal outcomes.\n\nThe results showed that a higher aMed diet score was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths were recorded. Women with the highest aMed diet scores were found to be at lower risk for both heart disease and stroke compared to those with the lowest scores, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The United States experienced a severe financial crisis in 2007, marked by a rise in unemployment, a collapse of the housing market, and the downfall of several major corporations. This ongoing economic downturn has raised important questions about the causes of the crisis and how to prevent similar events in the future. The crisis was primarily triggered by ill-conceived and shortsighted policies that pushed banks and financial institutions to issue sub-prime loans within a fragile and underdeveloped financial framework. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were under pressure to purchase and package these high-risk mortgages into complex securities, which ultimately led to a chain reaction of financial instability when borrowers defaulted on their loans. As a result, the banks found themselves with insufficient capital reserves and were forced to transfer the chaos to the securities they had sold and the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the crisis can be traced back to the Clinton administration's policies in the late 1990s, when it relaxed lending restrictions in an attempt to boost President Clinton's popularity. This move inadvertently set the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. As reported by Steven Holmes of the New York Times in 1999, Fannie Mae was under pressure from the government to increase mortgage lending to low- and moderate-income individuals, while also meeting the expectations of its shareholders for continued growth. Holmes correctly predicted the potential consequences of these actions, warning that the government-subsidized corporation might face financial difficulties in a downturn, requiring a government bailout similar to the one for the savings and loan industry in the 1980s. Unfortunately, the warnings went unheeded, and the economy eventually suffered a devastating collapse.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the proliferation of complex mortgage instruments such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These innovations created a web of interconnectedness between the housing market and other sectors of the economy, leaving households and financial markets vulnerable to even slight changes in the housing market. The result was a housing bubble that eventually burst, causing widespread financial instability. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for approximately 30% of the country's GDP. The crisis ultimately led to the collapse of several major financial institutions, including Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers, while others, such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, were forced to undergo significant regulatory changes. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in 2008.",
            "Ah, the infamous exposition - that part of your story where you spread your creative wings, only to risk losing your readers' interest with an overabundance of background information. Or, worse still, you might inadvertently put them to sleep or prompt them to hit the back button in frustration. Dr. Merlin has been known to lash out at her screen when she finds herself bogged down in unnecessary details, and it's far from an enjoyable experience.\n\nExposition is not a trusted ally in the world of writing. Many readers are already familiar with the fundamental tip \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself slipping into lengthy passages that fail to propel the plot forward. It's a common pitfall that can be avoided by recognizing the temptation to present a character's backstory or history at the expense of engaging storytelling.\n\nExposition is essentially the act of telling the audience about events, typically in a straightforward manner. In film, this can be seen when one character shares an excessive amount of information with another, much like the infamous \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, the author is responsible for embedding exposition into the narrative.\n\nLet's consider an example. Imagine reading a story where the heroine's past is summarized in a few sentences: \"She met her beloved at a certain place and time, got married in a grand ceremony, and witnessed her husband's tragic demise.\" You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to span multiple pages, with the characters having barely a few lines of conversation. Instead, you would expect the author to delve deeper into the husband's character by showing his love through his words and actions, and to explore the heroine's transformation through the impact of her husband's presence in her life. This would enable you to develop an emotional connection with the characters and gain insight into their thoughts, beliefs, and dreams.\n\nIn essence, you would expect more substance to be added to the basic storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\" As a writer, it's your responsibility to provide this depth and richness. While it can be tempting to rush through certain details, it's essential to resist the urge to oversimplify your characters' backgrounds and personalities. For instance, when introducing a new character, you might be tempted to reveal their entire history, from their time in the Air Force to their current role as a night manager at a gas station, including their past marriages and weekend fishing trips. However, it's crucial to avoid overwhelming the reader with too much information and instead opt for a more nuanced and engaging approach.",
            "I watched the morning news from NBC 4 in Columbus, Ohio on August 13, 2011. The live broadcast featured a story about a man from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. Although the wife's name was not mentioned, the husband, Shad Hostettler, was identified, and his mugshot was shown, which appeared to be quite disturbing. The news team devoted approximately two minutes to this developing story, which was sufficient given the circumstances. \n\nAnother story covered a shooting in the Sharon Woods area, where an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers was shot and critically injured. At that time, there were no arrests or suspects, and the SWAT team was investigating. I felt that this story was brief, and I suspect it might have been due to the fact that the victim was a minority and the incident occurred in a predominantly black neighborhood. This observation is consistent with my long-held perception that the media often glosses over crimes committed against minorities. \n\nFollowing that, the news reported on a gunshot wound discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. The authorities believed they knew where the incident occurred and mentioned that the damage was caused by a .22 caliber rifle bullet. A $5,000 reward was being offered for any information that could lead to the capture of the perpetrator. \n\nThe next story was about a forecast for thunderstorms and rain on Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to remain in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. The news team kept this segment brief, using it as a teaser to encourage viewers to stay tuned. \n\nAdditionally, the news covered a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus, which was committed by a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. He was described as being about six feet tall and 150 pounds. I found it unusual that the news emphasized the perpetrator's black skin tone and darkness.\n\nFinally, the broadcast featured a story about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas-based marijuana kingpin who had been found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. It was interesting to note that the news anchor chose to describe his sentence as 300 months rather than 25 years. I am uncertain whether this was an attempt to make the sentence sound more severe or not. The news also highlighted Rodriguez's Hispanic background, which seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "A profound connection exists between brothers, transcending words and emotions. This unbreakable bond encompasses a multitude of feelings - love, pride, envy, and even cruelty - making it difficult to fully comprehend. Brothers possess an uncanny understanding of one another, often seeing in each other a reflection of themselves. It is in the face of extreme adversity that the true nature of this bond reveals itself, whether it be positive or negative. The consequences of these emotions can be severe. To grasp the depth of the emotions tied to this fraternal link, one must accept the repercussions that accompany them. When a brother looks into the eyes of another and sees their own reflection, they gain insight into themselves, not as others perceive them, but as they genuinely are. Their true character is ultimately reflected in their actions and the outcomes of those actions. This theme is explored in James Hurst's \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" a tale of two brothers navigating the complex emotions that come with their relationship. Against the backdrop of a vividly described landscape, these brothers embark on a doomed journey. As their story unfolds, bitter disappointment collides with intense pride in a climactic confrontation, resulting in the survival of only one brother. Through the protagonist, the narrator, and their interactions, the narrative conveys the intricate emotions and worldviews that influence the protagonist's actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single dominant emotion: pride. From the outset, he feels resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle, as the latter's fragile health makes it impossible for him to participate in the activities the protagonist had envisioned for them. The protagonist's dreams of a brother to share experiences with, like exploring the outdoors, are shattered by Doodle's condition. This realization sparks a mix of anger and disappointment within the protagonist, who even contemplates infanticide in a moment of desperation. However, a fleeting glimpse of his brother's smile gives him hope, revealing a deeper love for Doodle that exists beneath his surface-level emotions. This juxtaposition of feelings highlights the complexity of the protagonist's character and the turmoil he experiences as he grapples with the reality of his brother's limitations.",
            "The brain is an intricate and dynamic mechanism for processing information. As technology evolved, the comparisons used to describe it have also become more sophisticated. Initially, the brain was likened to a wax tablet, followed by a sheet of papyrus, a book, and finally a computer. However, it's essential to remember that these comparisons have their limitations and can lead to inaccurate conclusions. \n\nThe process of processing information in the brain begins with the reception of data from sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, temperature, sound waves, and light into electrical signals. The sensory information is then continuously processed through the brain's algorithms, both from the bottom up and from the top down. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing integrates basic information such as color, orientation, and border definition to conclude that it's seeing a box. Meanwhile, top-down processing utilizes the decisions made at earlier stages to facilitate faster object recognition, such as identifying the object as a black box rather than a hole in the background.\n\nOnce information reaches a certain level of processing, an attention filter determines its significance and decides which cognitive processes it should be made accessible to. An example is when your brain processes every blade of grass when looking down at your shoes, but a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing each individual blade. Conversely, you'll more likely notice your name even in a noisy environment. There are various stages of processing, and attention modulates the results repeatedly.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it first needs to store it. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information must be encoded, with different encoding methods applicable to each type of sensory stimulus. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on its visual appearance, sound, or meaning. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Research on animals suggests that working memory, which retains information for approximately 20 seconds, is sustained through an electrical signal that loops through a particular sequence of neurons for a short duration. On the other hand, long-term memory is hypothesized to be sustained through the structure of specific types of proteins.\n\nThere are numerous theories on how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on how humans retrieve memories, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that there are nodes representing concepts, and the nodes are connected based on their relatedness. For instance, in the semantic network, the concept \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the impending threats posed by technology and the capitalist framework that sustains it in his dystopian novel, Brave New World. The society depicted values collective harmony above individuality, conditioning its citizens from the outset to prioritize immediate gratification above all else. The inhabitants are portrayed as pawns in a larger game, bound by a single ideology dictated by the World Controller. When examined through the lens of Marxist ideology, Huxley's work reveals his underlying skepticism towards the emergence of these systems. The novel's use of Marxist terminology, such as homogeny and reification, reinforces the notion that it is a commentary on the flaws in the economic systems of Huxley's time.\n\nThe novel satirizes capitalism by employing the Marxist concept of false consciousness. It suggests that the common people are prevented from understanding their true relationships with other social classes due to their primary focus on personal gain. This is exemplified by the conditioning of the population through hypnopædia, which reinforces the drive to consume, spend, and indulge. The World Controller manipulates the population in this manner, as seen in the actions of the lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, who have no genuine autonomy. Their will is instead shaped by the desires instilled in them, making them complicit in their own oppression.\n\nThe concept of hegemony, where a dominant group exercises control over other social classes, is also evident in Brave New World. The lower classes are unaware of their manipulation, literally buying into an ideology that perpetuates the existing power structure. The upper classes, comprising Alphas and Betas, are either unaware or unresponsive to the manipulation, with few exceptions like Bernard, who merely accepts his position. The novel's portrayal of the social classes' interactions is a significant indication of the perceived effects of capitalist oppression.\n\nThe relationships between individuals in Brave New World are superficial, lacking depth and emotional complexity. Huxley may be suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together erode human free will and expression. Love and intense emotions are absent, replaced by shallow interactions focused on physical appearance, as seen in the characters' comments about women and their encounters. The complacency of each social class with their position in the hierarchy and their absolute obedience to their role in the community reflect the Marxist notion of the proletariat, who are misled into believing their superiority is guaranteed as long as they conform to societal expectations.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for about two and a half years, which equates to four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, navigating the campus can be a significant challenge. In my first year, I lived in East Halls, which is one of the farthest residential areas from the main campus, excluding the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. Moving from my home in Stuart Hall to classrooms in buildings such as the Willard building, located near the center of campus, often took around 25 minutes on foot, especially during adverse weather conditions, which are common in State College. During a conversation with an alumnus not much older than me, I discovered that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the university by large stretches of unused land. However, this vacant space has since been transformed into sports fields, new buildings, and surrounding apartments. As the campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another is becoming increasingly difficult. The most effective solution to this mobility issue on a college campus is undoubtedly the bicycle. However, simply having a bike is not enough; students need to use it regularly, and the campus infrastructure should be designed with cyclists' needs in mind.\n\nTalking to a friend who had recently recommenced biking after a several-year break, I found out that he was wondering why he had stopped. He said, \"Bikes are great,\" and that for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it is the only efficient way to get around.\" In addition to being beneficial for one's health, bicycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical exertion can take you 30 miles or more. As an off-campus resident, I live as far from the campus center as some dorms. This year, I made the smart decision to purchase a bike. With classes in Thomas building, which takes around 25 minutes to walk from my home, riding a bike can significantly cut down the travel time to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly enough. However, my route to Thomas building, Pollock Road, is not the most convenient or safe option for biking. There are also advantages to walking, but personally, I am too busy to walk. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable means of getting to class, which would require an extra 30-40 minutes from my daily schedule, translating to over two and a half hours per week. Adding this to the additional time spent walking to and from other classes, appointments, and other commitments would leave me with no time to spare."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "My goal is to pursue a career in social work within the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on helping children who have been abused or neglected, and supporting troubled families. Key values that I will bring to this field include service, respect, an ethical approach, and a commitment to enhancing relationships and continued professional development. These core values are not only essential for social workers but also hold significant importance for me on a personal level.\n\nThroughout my high school and college years, I've always been drawn to helping others, but I wasn't certain about the specific career path I wanted to follow. Observing individuals who struggled with problems and often used inadequate coping mechanisms, I decided to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break, but a life-changing encounter with a troubled teenager that summer led me to reconsider my career path. I met a 16-year-old boy who was visiting his friend to escape an abusive home environment. The next day, he called the police, and I accompanied them to his parents' house, where I expressed my concerns and shared my recent graduation from Piedmont College with a degree in Psychology. The police asked me to talk to the parents, as they were unable to intervene due to legal limitations. When I questioned the parents, they seemed evasive and made excuses for their son's behavior, labeling it as manipulative. This experience sparked my serious consideration of a career in social work, which would allow me to help children resolve conflicts within their families.\n\nSocial justice is another essential value for the field of social work. As a society, we emphasize the importance of the individual but often prioritize conformity over uniqueness. This paradox has always puzzled me. If we mourn the loss of individuals, why do we strive to be like everyone else? I am an individual who refuses to conform to societal norms. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively protested against social injustices, expressing myself through non-traditional fashion choices, advocating for social justice causes, and standing up against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it. I strongly believe in social justice and will continue to advocate for it.",
            "This paper examines the relationship between biological and sociocultural factors in the context of insomnia. The biological model centers on the genetic and medical aspects that contribute to the disorder, such as inherited traits and physiological factors. In contrast, the sociocultural model explores how environmental influences, including demographic and socioeconomic factors, impact an individual's sleep patterns. The forthcoming review of insomnia research will delve into these models, analyzing the selected studies that shed light on and support these theories. The findings of these studies will be critiqued, highlighting their strengths and limitations.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders associated with other mental health conditions, or sleep disorders caused by other factors. The primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias and Parasomnias, while sleep disorders linked to mental health conditions are tied to Axis I or II disorders. Other categories of sleep disorders can arise from medical complications or substance intake. Dyssonmias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Primary Insomnia involves difficulty maintaining adequate sleep, whereas Primary Hypersomnia involves excessive daytime sleepiness, both lasting at least a month. Narcolepsy is characterized by cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. On the other hand, Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral or physiological anomalies. These include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The review focuses on insomnia and its relationship to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model examines the genetic, heritable, and physiological aspects of sleep disorders. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study using mice found that the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons is responsible for sleep-wake states. Activating the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibiting it reduces anxiety and induces sleep. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep duration in the study (Matsuki et al., 2009). The findings suggest that animal models can be applied to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. The absence or malfunction of this receptor could affect an individual's ability to sleep naturally without medication. From a sociocultural perspective, if the receptor's phenotype is inherited, it could influence sleep patterns, and any alterations to the receptor could disrupt sleep, impacting daily life, including academic and professional responsibilities, and routine tasks that require focus and concentration.",
            "This paper explores three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, the disorder is defined, and a clear understanding of its meaning is provided. The next section delves into its diagnosis, highlighting common signs or indicators, also known as \"red flags.\" Finally, the paper concludes by offering practical advice on how a teacher in a mainstream classroom can support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) refers to how efficiently the central nervous system processes auditory information. Essentially, it is a condition where the brain struggles to interpret sounds, despite the person having normal hearing abilities. People with CAPD are not considered deaf or hard of hearing, but they may struggle to distinguish between different sounds, separate background noise from meaningful conversations, or differentiate between words. \n\nThe concept of CAPD originated in the mid-1950s, initially referred to as \"auditory imperception.\" In 1954, Italian researchers began developing tests to identify children with communication disorders, and in 1961, a Japanese researcher introduced a method called dichotic testing to understand the brain's physiology. A national conference in 1977 further sparked research into CAPD.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways, including difficulties with sound localization, recognizing sound patterns, or differentiating changes in speech. Individuals with CAPD may struggle to filter out background noise, understand sarcasm through tone of voice, or follow the sequence of auditory information. They may also experience sound blocking or have difficulty interpreting sounds in a meaningful way. \n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a comprehensive assessment is necessary, which may involve observing listening behaviors and performance on auditory function tests conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals. Various measures are used to evaluate auditory-related skills, including questionnaires, surveys, and observation of auditory responses to certain stimuli. Currently, there is no single, widely accepted diagnostic tool or test for CAPD, and the underlying cause of the disorder remains unknown. Some tests present the patient with multiple sounds simultaneously and ask them to differentiate between them, while more advanced tests involve recording and measuring the brain's response to acoustic signals within the ear.",
            "The play Twelfth Night suggests that while disguises can be useful in deceiving others, they can ultimately lead to a loss of identity if not abandoned. However, giving up a deception can also result in feelings of isolation, as one may be rejected by those who were misled. This leaves individuals with a difficult choice between preserving their own identity and maintaining their relationships with others, who may react negatively to the truth. The issue of deception in Twelfth Night, particularly through gender role reversal, raises additional questions, such as why someone would choose to conceal their true identity and adopt a disguise. For instance, in Viola's case, she felt compelled to disguise herself as a man to protect herself from potential harm after arriving in a foreign land. \n\nThis disguise allowed her to avoid danger but also led to her separation from the support system of women and created complications in her relationships, including Olivia's mistaken attraction to her and suppressed romantic feelings towards Orsino. Although this may seem progressive to modern readers, Twelfth Night can also be seen as a study of how deception can bring suppressed emotions to the surface, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. The play hints at the possibility that these characters may have repressed desires that are revealed through Viola/Cesario's presence. For example, Olivia's switch in affection from Cesario to Sebastian suggests that her initial attraction was superficial and based on appearance, aligning with the societal judgments of Olivia's time. This interpretation is further supported by her eventual shift in perception of Cesario/Viola, viewing her as family rather than a romantic interest.",
            "German colonial rule was marked by brutality, particularly in its treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, the colonial empire's policies and governance varied significantly across its territories, mirroring its diverse geography. This diversity was also reflected in the provision of education, with some colonies experiencing notable success in educating and literate their populations. For instance, when Britain took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a well-educated and literate African population. Similarly, German efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were praised as effective by contemporary observers.\n\nIn stark contrast, South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a drastically different scenario. Unlike East Africa, where the government played a significant role in native education, the task of educating the local population in South West Africa was largely left to missionary societies that received limited government support. Notably, however, the government invested heavily in educating Europeans in the colony, establishing state schools and regulating missionary schools with significant support. This disparity in educational policies had lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule ended. Unlike other German colonies, which boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, the majority of the population in South West Africa remained uneducated and illiterate. Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this disparity.\n\nThis paper seeks to expand the discussion by examining these factors and giving particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans. A wealth of literature exists on education in the German colonial empire, but most of these sources are written in German and focus on describing the features of educational systems. Later studies in English offered comparative analyses of education in the various German colonies, highlighting significant differences in their educational systems. A notable study by Cohen compared the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa, attributing the differences between them to the large settler population in South West Africa. \n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, with a significant portion of the territory being arid desert. This hospitable climate led to a substantial European population, with nearly 15,000 whites residing in South West Africa by 1913, compared to only 5,336 in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population.",
            "Over the past century, the classification of popular music has become increasingly complex due to the proliferation of numerous genres, with many of these genres branching out into multiple sub-genres. This complexity is further exacerbated by the fact that most genres, such as rock, country, jazz, and folk, have spawned numerous sub and sub-sub genres. Among these, the Heavy Metal sub-genre of rock music has emerged as one of the most diverse and expressive in the past 40 years, characterized by its wide range of emotions, predominantly leaning towards the darker end of the emotional spectrum.\n\nIts diversity stems from the early recognition of its flexibility, which allowed artists to create their own sub-genres, followed by sub-sub-genres, and this trend continues to the present day. As a result, the heavy metal movement has branched out into numerous niches, making it challenging to define its core identity. To understand the metal music that exists today, it is essential to grasp the underlying principles and motivations that define the metal movement.\n\nAt its core, the metal movement is characterized by its association with darkness, which can be seen as \"music of excess\" – more emphasis on bass, volume, violence, and theatricality. Musicians in metal bands are highly skilled, evident in their intricate playing styles. Additionally, the movement has a strong connection to the use of psychedelic drugs, which emerged in the 1970s and influenced the creation of avant-garde and otherworldly music. Metal music often incorporates dark and visceral qualities, a departure from the generally lighter tone of popular music. Later generations of metal have drawn inspiration from the Romantic Era's dark and intense qualities. The lyrics of metal songs, such as those in Helter Skelter by the Beatles, exemplify the movement's focus on darkness and the exploration of the human experience.",
            "Before the Surrealist movement emerged, French painter Henri Rousseau was creating works that embodied his own dreams and aspirations. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only captures a woman's wonder at the fantastical world she encounters in her dreams but also reflects Rousseau's internal struggle to balance his desire for recognition with his need for creative freedom. As a painter, Rousseau yearned for the approval of his peers and art enthusiasts, yet he faced an internal conflict: to conform to established styles and gain acceptance from the art world, or to forge his own path and maintain his individuality.\n\nTo understand The Dream, it's essential to know Rousseau's background. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval, northwest France, he came from a relatively affluent family. His father was a successful businessman, but Rousseau himself received no formal art training. Instead, he worked as a municipal toll collector until the age of 40, when he began painting as a way to escape the pain of losing his first wife and eight children. Unlike many of his contemporaries, who romanticized the peasant class, Rousseau's paintings were rooted in his own experiences and the hopes of the ordinary people around him. His quest for acceptance by the art world was fueled by his late start in life and the fact that he began creating art alongside renowned artists like Matisse. As art historian Jan Gordon noted, while both artists were technically competitors, their motivations and styles differed significantly. Matisse sought to avoid clichés in his work, whereas Rousseau aimed to create a conventional piece that would earn him recognition from the prestigious Artiste Français.",
            "The connection between ethics and aesthetics, and truth and beauty, has been a subject of discussion among many prominent thinkers. In my view, this relationship is rooted in a fundamental aspect of human experience. As John Keats poetically conveys in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" beauty and truth are intertwined, and this is all we need to know. While education and experience play a significant role in shaping our understanding of the world, our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seems to be more instinctual, as if we're drawn to them without being explicitly taught. Both ethics and aesthetics are more about describing and explaining concepts rather than providing a set of rules. Our studies of morality and beauty primarily focus on understanding what makes a piece of art or literature beautiful, or an action moral, rather than establishing a set of guidelines for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nMoreover, criticism of art or morals can never fully capture the essence of what is good or beautiful. For instance, a discussion about the Mona Lisa might involve concepts like composition, context, and contrast, but these factors don't fully explain why the painting is considered good art. People often find it difficult to articulate why they love a particular work of art or literature, and they might say something like, \"There's just something about it.\" I believe that art and morals cannot be reduced to a set of descriptive qualities, and both have a transcendent quality that cannot be fully expressed. Flannery O'Connor once said that stories can convey meaning that cannot be put into words, and this is also true for ethics. Ludwig Wittgenstein noted that ethics is transcendental and cannot be expressed. I propose that this ineffable quality is the most powerful aspect of art and morality, and it's this shared transcendent nature that connects them.\n\nI think morality and art are closely related because they both have a profound impact on us at a level that's difficult to put into words. This connection is even stronger in literature, which, as McKean suggests, is distinguished by its moral quality. While moral standards might not be applicable to all art forms, they seem particularly relevant to literature, which is essential to us because of the values it conveys. Living involves values, and literature is a powerful means of exploring and understanding these values.",
            "Germany is a powerful nation with a unique blend of cultures that encompasses the country from the shadows of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel and from Cologne on the Rhine River to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River. This rich cultural heritage is a result of the country's diverse history, shaped by various tribes and influences. \n\nThe term 'Germania' refers to the ancestral homeland of the German people, with its origins being a topic of debate among scholars and historians. According to historical accounts, the name 'Germania' might have originated from the Tungrian tribe or a Germanic tribe that lived before crossing the Rhine River to battle the Gauls. Julius Caesar is credited with using the term 'Germanus' for the first time in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he differentiated between the Gauls he had conquered and the Germanic tribes he had not yet defeated. The term 'Germanus' could be derived from the Gaulish language, referring to a neighboring group, or from the Old Norse word 'ger,' meaning spear, or the Old Irish word 'garim,' meaning 'to shout,' which might describe the loud and boisterous nature of the Germanic tribes.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote extensively about the origins of the Germans in his work 'De Origine et situ Germanorum' around AD 98. According to Tacitus, the Germans were an indigenous people with little to no influence from other cultures. He noted that the Romans did not migrate to Germania, but rather, they visited the region to trade and conquer its resources, while the Germanic tribes engaged in wars with the Romans and other neighboring groups. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the 1st century AD, they interacted with the Roman Empire, trading goods and skills, including serving in the Roman army.",
            "As I gazed downward, my mind was a blank slate, taking in the scene before me without any emotional attachment or analysis.  My thoughts flashed in and out of my consciousness at an incredible pace, leaving no lasting impression.  It was as if my awareness was a fluid, engaged experience, merely observing what lay before me. \n\nAt one point, a friend who was an artist recommended I read \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" to learn about drawing techniques.  I had long been fascinated by drawing since I was six years old, and this book provided a comprehensive guide, covering everything from understanding basic materials to how the brain interprets lines.  One of its key strategies is to frame a picture within a square to simplify its complexities.  For instance, what once appeared as an intricate scene – a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room – can be distilled into a straightforward, simplified image – that same bowl of fruit on a flat surface.\n\nAs I stood before the bowl, I found it impossible to mentally impose this artistic framework.  I was overwhelmed and in awe, unable to do anything but stand there in wonder.  Different artists have their distinct styles, such as Picasso's blue period, Monet's love of greenery, or the Italian Renaissance masters' use of vibrant colors.  If I were to consider myself an artist, this scene before me was the start of my artistic expression, the beginning of \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy hand instinctively reached for the pencil, and as I began to draw, my muscles tensed and relaxed, translating my thoughts into art.  Water droplets and light danced before my eyes, and particles broke away, disappearing into nothingness.  However, my second attempt at drawing was marked by a sudden surge of anxiety, as my hand slapped the handle of the toilet handle in frustration.  Before me lay an unyielding, brown mass that seemed stuck to the bottom of the toilet, an unwelcome gift for the Rite Aid cleaning staff.\n\nWith a mop in hand, my feet shoulder-width apart, and my tie tied uncomfortably tight, I stared at the uninviting, processed matter left behind.  After a few more attempts to flush and moments of introspection, I reached out to grab the roll of toilet paper, wrapping it around my hand like a mitt.  With a slow, deliberate movement, I dipped my mummified hand into the bowl, much like a mother carefully placing a turkey in the oven on Thanksgiving day….",
            "The alarming rate of teenage fatalities behind the wheel is a pressing concern.  Several factors contribute to this tragic statistic, including the fact that the adolescent brain is not fully equipped to handle the risks associated with driving, and the inherent inexperience of young drivers.  This inexperience not only increases the likelihood of fatal accidents but also leads to a higher incidence of rollover accidents, speeding, and driving off the road. \n\nMoreover, when teens drive with their peers, the risk of accidents increases even further.  Research conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center showed a correlation between the age of passengers and the number of traffic accidents.  To address this issue, California and other states have implemented temporary provisional licenses that restrict the hours teens can drive and prohibit minors as passengers.  However, these measures are merely Band-Aid solutions, as the fundamental problem lies in the fact that young drivers, as a group, are statistically unable to adequately manage the risks and responsibilities associated with driving.\n\nExperts, such as psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, argue that even 18-year-olds are not mature enough to handle the demands of driving.  His research suggests that individuals under the age of 19 or 20 have a strong desire for thrill-seeking, which can lead to reckless behavior behind the wheel.  It is logical, therefore, to delay the issuance of driver's licenses until this tendency to take risks has diminished.  If we continue to issue licenses to young teens, we can expect the number of fatal accidents to rise, potentially reaching catastrophic levels.  With the Baby Boomer generation's children soon becoming eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers hitting the roads, the situation is becoming increasingly dire.\n\nA straightforward solution to this issue is to establish a national policy that ensures no one under the age of 18 can operate a vehicle.  Driver's education classes could continue to be provided in schools, and a provisional permit could still be issued before a full license is granted, requiring a certain number of practical driving hours.  The number of hours required could be based on the existing standards set by most states, such as the 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult required in California.  Given that the problem affects drivers across the nation, a uniform, national law would be a reasonable and effective means of protecting young drivers. \n\nMy proposed legislation is not a novel idea, but rather a common-sense solution to a pressing problem.",
            "Upon examining the early films available at the Library of Congress, I decided to review the collection of trick films produced by Edison from 1895 to 1901. This particular subset of films relies heavily on creative editing techniques to create the illusion of something out of nothing. My study primarily focused on analyzing the poetic elements characteristic of most trick films and identifying the distinct features that emerged in some of the later productions. \n\nEarly trick films, which were often set-bound and shot from a fixed position, adhered to a standardized approach that involved using long and medium shots and maintaining a single shot per film. However, there were some groundbreaking films at the beginning of the 20th century that dared to break free from these conventions by incorporating features such as multiple shots. These early films shared a common trait of being shot within an interior set, mimicking the stage setting of a frontal proscenium. The camera remained stationary, never moving to follow characters or objects. This setup was heavily influenced by the theater and vaudeville traditions, where the actors would move laterally, never towards or away from the audience.\n\nOne notable aspect of these early films is the limited movement of actors within the frame. The action in films like \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900) showcases this, where characters enter from one side and move horizontally, staying within the frame. When they exit, the camera remains stationary, not following them off-screen. This composition also led to the minimal use of close-up shots, as the camera would rarely zoom in on a specific detail. Instead, filmmakers relied on long and medium shots, adhering to the traditional theater and vaudeville format where the audience viewed the entire performance from a fixed viewpoint.\n\nThe conventional approach of one shot per film restricted the length of trick films to around a minute or less, depending on the frame rate used. This constraint limited the narrative and dramatic potential of these films, which often focused on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic and disappearing acts, rather than developing a cohesive story. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that a single \"shot\" in a trick film may not always be a single physical shot, but rather a composite of multiple shots cleverly edited together to create an illusion. For example, in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), the physical shot that appears to show Mary's severed head is revealed to be a joined sequence of shots, illustrating the artful manipulation of editing in early film production.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an advocate for the principles of Republicanism, driven by his experiences as an agriculturalist and a brief career in politics. His unwavering commitment to personal freedom and government accountability was a hallmark of his character. His strong agrarian views served as the foundation for his opinions on governance, with a focus on preserving and promoting what he saw as the most superior career path.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a unique opportunity to establish a utopian system, free from the constraints of native traditions that could hinder the development of self-governance. He firmly believed in the inherent rights of individuals, which he considered interdependent and crucial to the well-being of society. He argued that these rights should not be subject to government interference. In his view, the concept of a \"state of nature\" meant that those with physical superiority and malevolent intentions often thrived, but that this should not be the case in a civilized society.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor advocated for a government that acknowledges the duality of human nature, comprising both good and evil. He rigidly adhered to a dualistic morality, stating that a government's virtues and vices are inherently human. He defined virtuous principles as those that protect private property, promote agriculture, and discourage excessive capitalism. Taylor believed that a government grounded in these principles would function equitably, despite the self-interest and avarice that often accompany its administration. He saw self-interest as a natural human motivation, but only considered it evil when it led to the exploitation of others. A good government was necessary to balance human nature, and its principles must be carefully monitored to prevent the introduction of detrimental principles.\n\nLike many Republicans of his time, Taylor championed a strict construction of the Constitution, advocating for a limited federal government with powers explicitly stated in the document. He recognized that a large federal government would be expensive and potentially tyrannical. However, he believed that a literal interpretation of the Constitution, without considering the intent of its authors, could lead to corruption. Furthermore, Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence the true foundation of the United States, as it more explicitly describes the nation as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single entity.",
            "Upon examining Figure 17, a significant drop in commuter log submissions was observed in the third month of the project, which was somewhat disheartening and challenging to explain. The onset of winter at a New England campus likely led to a decrease in bicycle and foot commuting, contributing to this decline. The end of the fall semester in December, coupled with the subsequent holiday season, may have caused the commuter log to fall off the radar for many individuals. Additionally, the prolonged break in late December and early January might have reduced the need for students and faculty to commute to campus. Although classes resumed in late January, the low number of submissions for February remained unexplained. It's possible that the initial enthusiasm for the project naturally waned over time, necessitating strategies to maintain momentum. In response, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a targeted campaign that successfully boosted log submissions for that month. However, sustaining project engagement proved challenging, particularly due to the natural decrease in participation and the added constraints of academic breaks.\n\nOne of the underlying challenges of this project (and similar initiatives) is the widespread preference for personal freedom, independence, and flexibility offered by driving cars. To counter this, it's essential to provide incentives for alternative commuting modes. Throughout the project, we offered gift cards to local businesses, but it would have been intriguing to explore the impact of larger prizes, such as a bicycle, hybrid car, or electric vehicle. This could have potentially mitigated the decline in engagement. The value of the prizes remained constant throughout the project, whereas increasing the prize value over time might have been more effective. Initially, the gift cards seemed sufficient, but announcing additional, higher-value prizes in December (e.g., bicycles) and January (e.g., hybrid or electric cars) could have potentially boosted participation instead of decreasing it.",
            "An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a financial instrument designed to track a specific index, commodity, or collection of assets, similar to an index fund, but with greater flexibility and trading capabilities similar to individual stocks on an exchange.  An ETF offers the diversification benefits of an index fund and the advantages of owning individual stocks, such as short selling, margin buying, and the ability to purchase as few as a single share.  While these benefits are highly appealing, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund.  However, there are some drawbacks, including the requirement to pay commissions for ETF trades, similar to stock transactions.  An additional benefit of ETFs is the wide range of available funds.  To assess the effectiveness of ETFs, it is essential for informed investors to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, actually exist and to what extent.  In this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to determine whether owning a single ETF provides similar benefits to owning a diversified portfolio of the same stocks and whether alternative configurations might offer a more optimal risk-adjusted return.\n\nIn order to simplify the analysis, we have chosen to focus on the top 10 holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets.  We will use the current asset allocation to estimate the contribution of each stock to a portfolio's beta and return if the portfolio were comprised solely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF.  The calculations of beta and return are presented in the following chart.\n\nFrom the chart, it is clear that a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns.  Moreover, the beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF's beta.  Preliminary results suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide higher returns with a lower risk.  Nevertheless, it is possible that the means of the two portfolios may not be statistically different.\n\nTo further assess the statistical difference between these portfolios, we calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, to compare their combined standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" is considered one of his superior works. In this poem, Poe employs the term \"Thulé,\" which has its roots in Virgil. However, it's also tied to a more contemporary source, given Poe's interest in German literature, particularly the works of Goethe. Karl J. Arndt notes the similarity between Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon,\" suggesting that Poe may have been influenced by the latter.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature highlights Goethe's notable work, \"Faust,\" a poetic drama published in two parts, with the second part being released in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Within \"Faust,\" there's a poem called \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells the story of a king who, after his wife's passing, descends into heavy drinking and grief. This character's behavior parallels the description of the king in Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" which can be seen as a dark reflection of the narrator's own struggles with loss and his reliance on drinking. Interestingly, a romantic drama adaptation of \"Faust\" was published in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term Thulé in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe references Thulé twice in his collected works, using the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and employing it as a bookend in \"Dream-Land.\" The two works can be seen as complementary pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a desolate and colorless world, haunted by the presence of deceased friends, much like the King of Thulé, who has lost his wife and is struggling to find purpose.\n\nPoe's familiarity with Goethe's work is also evident through his admiration for Alfred Tennyson, another notable author. Poe's statement on Tennyson suggests that he would have been exposed to Goethe's work through various reproductions and adaptations that were prevalent after the original publication of \"Faust.\"",
            "Under California law, if a customer slips and falls in a grocery store due to an applesauce spill, they might be eligible to receive punitive damages if the store manager was reckless and acted with malicious intent. A judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages without a thorough examination. To justify an award of punitive damages, Palmer must provide evidence that the store manager's actions were taken with a deliberate disregard for the potential harm caused, and that his conduct was reprehensible. Palmer can argue that the manager, Paul Martin, should have known about the potential harm of not cleaning the spill, given that multiple customers had already slipped and fallen at the store in the months preceding Palmer's accident. Additionally, Palmer can argue that Martin's inaction was inexcusable, considering that he had been informed of the spill twice, yet chose to ignore it because he was on dinner break. Although Palmer's claim of Martin's despicable actions may be less convincing, it is still a reasonable argument given the fact that several slip-and-fall incidents had occurred at the store in 2009, and Martin failed to take necessary measures to maintain the store's safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about the applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin responded by stating he was on dinner break and couldn't deal with customer complaints. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin of the spill, but he responded with the same excuse. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, suffering a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, there had been five reported slip-and-fall incidents at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering filing a motion for partial summary judgment on the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The statute defines malice as conduct intending to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when it was committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, where the defendant was aware of the probable consequences of his actions and deliberately failed to avoid them.",
            "It's been almost four years since I took a course on Islam at CBC, and one of the topics that still resonates with me is whether Islam is a hostile religion or not. In my opinion, this question is more relevant today than ever, especially considering the changing media portrayal of Islam in America since 9/11. The fact that a presidential candidate with an obvious Muslim background, such as Barack Obama, was viable in 2008 is a stark contrast to the hostile views that dominated the media in 2001.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad has left an impression on me, as it contrasts with my initial understanding of his history. I had previously believed that Muhammad forced people to convert to Islam, but the biography portrays him as a misunderstood figure who was humble and merciful. According to the account, people were drawn to his teachings, not coerced, and they came to see the truth in his words voluntarily.\n\nInterestingly, there are similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles attributed to Muhammad. For instance, Muhammad's multiplication of food to feed forty men is strikingly similar to the miracles of Jesus. This style of storytelling has made me wonder whether the authors aimed to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove himself, but instead lived a life of truth and miracles. However, this narrative approach downplays the significance of Jesus Christ's life and miracles, making it seem like Muhammad's story is an attempt to co-opt or borrow from Jesus' narrative.\n\nAnother aspect that troubled me about the biography is the reliance on third-party accounts to prove the truth of the stories. While the intention behind this method may have been to provide evidence, it actually diminishes the credibility of the stories and raises suspicions. Furthermore, the portrayal of Muhammad as a gentle and humble man is at odds with historical records, which portray him as a more complex figure. I worry that Muslims today may not be aware of the full history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The Christian teachings and beliefs that Jesus held during his lifetime were initially set aside as Christianity evolved following his passing.  Looking at the broader picture, it's clear that Christianity has drifted further and further from its roots over time.  Today, there's a growing awareness and a progressive shift in the world, particularly among traditional individuals who resist any departure from the original teachings.  However, their influence may not be substantial enough to dictate the course of the religion as a whole.  In the future, a heightened awareness of history among Christians will emerge, and there will be a growing desire to distinguish the doctrines developed over time from Jesus' original intentions.  This reversal will eventually lead to a significant shift in Christian history, as a movement gains momentum, stripping away layers of added doctrine, returning to the core principles Jesus introduced, untainted by the ideas of later thinkers.  This trend will spread across the United States and Europe, influencing the masses, who will return to worshipping in a manner reminiscent of Jesus' time, adhering to his original ideas.  The church as an institution will remain strong, guiding this movement, but the outcome will be a unified, more homogeneous Christian community, with reduced diversity.  As we look at human history, we see that reversals are not uncommon, such as the shift from persecution to the Roman Empire embracing Christianity, or the transformation of the United States from African-American slavery to leadership.  A similar reversal is expected to unfold in the Christian faith, seeking its roots and undoing the diversity that has developed over time.  Crucially, this process will be facilitated by reinterpreting Jesus' words as metaphors rather than literal statements.  To understand this development, we must look back to the earliest roots of Christianity, which originated in Judaism.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., Judaism was already a complex faith with monotheism, divinely revealed scripture, and Hebrew authority at its core.  The Jewish population was not a unified entity, with various groups like Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and common people existing alongside one another.",
            "I firmly believe that beneath the surface, human nature is driven by self-interest and a focus on personal gain. People tend to prioritize their own well-being over others, often disregarding the needs and well-being of those less fortunate. The novel \"The Jungle\" by Upton Sinclair vividly portrays this selfish aspect of human nature through its depiction of the factory owners and managers. These individuals are solely concerned with expanding their businesses and amassing wealth, without regard for the consequences or the harm caused to others. As Sinclair illustrates, the factories' pollution and environmental impact are starkly visible, with massive smokestacks emitting pollutants and animal waste from the overcrowded conditions of the pens.\n\nThe factory owners and managers also exploited their employees, treating them as mere commodities to be used and discarded. They were willing to do whatever it took to increase their profits, even if it meant pushing their workers to their limits and beyond. The novel paints a bleak picture of a system where workers were not valued as individuals, but rather as replaceable assets. The absence of labor laws and regulations during the era enabled the factory owners to operate with impunity, forcing workers to toil in hazardous conditions without any protection or support. The working-class individuals living in Packingtown were expected to endure the harsh conditions of their lives, with no access to resources or organizations that could aid them.\n\nThe labor unions, which were intended to provide support to workers, often ended up perpetuating the system of exploitation. They profited from the struggles of the working-class individuals, further entrenching their exploitation. As a result, the workers were trapped in a cycle of poverty and oppression, described by Sinclair as a form of modern-day slavery. This situation led to widespread immorality and desperation, mirroring the conditions of the old chattel slavery system.",
            "When writing, many authors attempt to evoke a particular sentiment or attitude in their readers towards significant subjects. Some techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs a range of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. One such method involves combining an adjective and a noun in an unconventional way to create a distinct aura around a subject. Another technique is assigning meaning to a symbol and then utilizing it to convey a specific feeling. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald frequently employs the latter technique with various colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. \n\nFitzgerald establishes meaning for colors, particularly white/gray, and later leverages this meaning to evoke a particular feeling in relation to a crucial object. The meaning he creates for white/gray is related to uniformity, with white being associated with a sense of refinement and higher social standing, while gray is linked to something older and faded. \n\nAt the beginning of the novel, Fitzgerald sets up this meaning by consistently using both colors. Characters such as Daisy and Jordan are frequently depicted wearing white, while the narrator, Nick, observes that everyone at a party is dressed in white. However, the only time this is not the case is when Nick is describing his initial impressions of Gatsby's party, where the atmosphere is described as gaudy with primary colors. Fitzgerald further reinforces these color associations by applying them to ordinary, unremarkable subjects, such as buildings and people. He describes Nick's daily commute to work as traveling through \"white chasms of lower New York,\" and the names of people at Gatsby's party appear as \"gray names\" on Nick's schedule. He also uses white or gray to describe ordinary people or places, like Jordan and Daisy's shared \"white girlhood\" or the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes. \n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established the meaning of white/gray, he uses them to signify a lack of importance or uniformity in certain subjects. This technique begins with the character of Daisy. After a period of relative absence from these colors, Fitzgerald begins to associate Daisy with white, portraying her as dressed in a \"little white roadster.\" This depiction reduces Daisy to a uniform, almost anonymous figure, someone Gatsby longs for but does not truly understand. Fitzgerald employs this technique repeatedly to reinforce the idea that Daisy is more of an idealized concept than a fully fleshed-out character, as seen in her wearing a \"gray haze of fur collar\" or another \"white\" dress before the encounter between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County's favorable climate allows for a thriving agricultural sector, with a variety of crops being cultivated, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, and peppers. The region has a strong demand for organic, community-supported agriculture food, resulting in long waiting lists for local organizations. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Many organic farms in the area offer tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. By adopting organic farming practices, landowners can benefit from government programs while also preserving and enhancing the local ecosystem.\n\nIn addition to catering to a lucrative niche market, organic farming brings several environmental benefits, such as increased biodiversity and a healthier environment, due to the absence of chemical use in farming. However, organic farming comes with higher costs and labor requirements compared to conventional farming, as it demands more intensive labor and management to control pests, weeds, and soil fertility without the use of chemicals. Organic farms often face greater losses and lack the efficiency of large-scale operations. Furthermore, practices that benefit wildlife, such as planting cover crops, rotational grazing, and invasive species removal, can also incur higher labor costs. As a result, landowners may seek financial assistance or expert guidance to maximize both profits and environmental quality.\n\nThe selected land parcel is situated in unincorporated San Diego County, California, adjacent to the town of Potrero, and comprises 160 acres of chaparral, Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. The East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan protects over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and several butterfly species, while others are declining and may soon be listed, including the burrowing owl.\n\nThis area has been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries and was later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. As part of an original homestead patent, the land was likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many years. To explore the possibilities for a small farmer in this region, a piece of property was selected from a real estate website, and relevant government programs were researched to identify potential cost-saving options and wildlife-friendly practices. An existing organic farm in the same area served as a model for this hypothetical scenario.",
            "Culture holds significant weight in the negotiation process. Culture encompasses a broad spectrum of characteristics, which are often defined by what they lack or signify rather than their inherent nature. It is crucial to recognize that culture is not a uniform or singular entity, but rather a complex and multifaceted aspect of human experience. Making generalizations about a culture, such as labeling an entire nation as stubborn or accommodating, oversimplifies the complexities involved. Instead, a more effective approach for a negotiator is to comprehend the nuances of a culture's values and how they impact the negotiation at hand. \n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture requires a multifaceted approach, encompassing its history, values, and even its potential biases. Rather than judging or attempting to alter a culture, it is essential to accept and work within its boundaries, particularly when in a weaker negotiating position. When negotiating in a foreign environment, respecting local traditions and customs can facilitate a smoother transition and help overcome cultural barriers. \n\nIt is worth noting that cultural boundaries do not strictly follow national or international lines. Organizational cultures within a nation can exhibit unique characteristics, such as varying work hours, communication styles, or hiring practices. For instance, some companies prioritize work-life balance, while others emphasize long working hours. By examining these differences, we can appreciate the diversity of thought within a given culture. Even within a seemingly uniform culture, there may be more to discover beneath the surface. \n\nUnderstanding core values is vital, as they provide insight into the underlying motivations and driving forces behind a culture. In cultures where saving face or maintaining harmony is highly valued, a negotiator will not publicly criticize their company or superiors to achieve a positive outcome. Conversely, in cultures that prioritize aggressive negotiations, a hard bargain is more likely. Considering these cultural nuances before entering a negotiation can greatly increase its effectiveness. However, it is also essential to establish a personal connection with the opposing party to create a more successful negotiation outcome.",
            "The phrase \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" originates from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible and serves as the starting point for St. Anselm's argument on the existence of God. Similarly, Thomas Aquinas also expresses this belief, which is why we will compare and contrast their arguments to determine whose is more convincing. To ensure a fair comparison, we will assume they both believe in the God of the Bible, as a hypothetical, non-Christian God would not be directly comparable. While both authors present valid points, neither provides a comprehensive foundation for faith in God.\n\nTo illustrate this point, let's examine St. Anselm's argument first. He emphasizes the role of introspection in understanding God, suggesting that the existence of God can be found within one's own mind. Anselm's idea is that our understanding of God is innate, and we don't need external evidence to prove it. This concept is often referred to as faith, where one accepts something as true without concrete empirical evidence. \n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas proposes that the existence of God can be logically proven through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith. This approach has practical implications for evangelism, as it allows potential converts to be persuaded by logic rather than relying on faith. Aquinas provides five distinct logical arguments to demonstrate the necessity of God's existence: the arguments of change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. These arguments demonstrate that the existence of God is a logical necessity, analogous to a missing puzzle piece that can be inferred from the rest of the puzzle without being seen directly.",
            "In the 5th or 6th century BCE, a future Buddha was born, who would later be known as the Buddha. Over the course of his life, he renounced worldly life and achieved enlightenment, leading to the establishment of Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being its most traditional form. This ancient religion, which is approximately 2500 years old, has undergone significant changes since the Buddha's time, as seen in countries like Sri Lanka, where the Theravada nation observes the water-cutting ceremony, a tradition that does not have its roots in the Buddha's teachings. These differences in traditions and core principles can be observed in both the monastic and lay communities of Theravada Buddhism, and have evolved due to a mix of internal and external factors, including both hostile and benign influences.\n\nTo facilitate this discussion, certain key terms will be used frequently. Internal forces refer to changes driven by Buddhist members, regardless of their monastic status, whereas external forces originate from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces aim to harm the Buddhist community, often fueled by a negative perception of the religion, whereas benign forces do not intend to harm or help, but may inadvertently do so. These terms will be used repeatedly in this discussion.\n\nTo begin, it's essential to understand the foundational principles of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the Triple Gem, consisting of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is comprised of the Tripitaka, which includes three collections of texts: the Sutta Pitaka (containing the Suttas), the Vinaya Pitaka (laying out disciplinary rules), and the Abhidhamma Pitaka (covering metaphysical aspects of Buddhism). Key metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these principles is crucial to ending Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, along with the cessation of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), which occur when one achieves enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for living, with five precepts for laymen (non-harming, non-deception, non-theft, non-misbehavior, and non-intoxication) and additional rules for monks. The Four Noble Truths form the central doctrine of Buddhism, stating that life is marked by suffering (Dukkha), that attachment causes suffering, and that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico represent a case study of a 57-year-long rivalry, spanning from 1836 to 1893, marked by periodic clashes and tensions between the two nations. The conflict reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, which resulted in the United States' victory and its acquisition of Texas and the American Southwest. This prolonged rivalry was fueled by fundamental differences in values, customs, and interests, as well as historical grievances, including a clash of material interests. \n\nThis scenario is not unique, as neighboring countries often experience similar rivalries due to shared border disputes and competing interests. The U.S.-Mexico relationship shares similarities with other enduring rivalries between border-sharing nations. Historian David M. Pletcher observed that the United States has faced long-standing diplomatic challenges in Mexico and Cuba, largely due to their geographical proximity and historical tensions. \n\nReligious differences were a significant factor in the U.S.-Mexico conflict, echoing a recurring theme throughout history. As Sally Frahm noted, the United States has historically been wary of Catholicism and monarchy, mirroring the ideological divisions seen in the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. This mistrust was inherited from the historical animosity between the English and Spanish, which hindered the establishment of friendly diplomatic relations between the two nations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts documented 17 disputes between the United States and Mexico during the 57-year period of rivalry. Most of these conflicts centered on territorial issues, including border raids and frontier problems, which persisted until both countries deployed military force along their borders. As historian Schmitt noted, the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States and the U.S. shifted its focus from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico during the latter part of the 19th century.",
            "It's been 15 years since an unexpected illness left me disabled, stripping away my career as a nurse and the security I had worked towards since childhood. I had become a nurse to ensure a stable future, as I had been repeatedly told, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" However, this mantra fell apart when I was 46, single, and without savings. To this day, I rely on Social Security Disability, and the little I had is now gone. Each day is a struggle, constantly threatening my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Yet, I've come to realize that my family and close friends have been my lifeline, and I couldn't have survived without them.\n\nMy experience has taught me that emergencies can strike anyone, big or small. No matter how prepared we think we are, there are some challenges we simply cannot overcome alone. In the US, it's clear that we've become too reliant on the government to solve our problems, but I believe that learning to trust and help one another would be a more effective solution.\n\nThe idea of rugged individualism, often emphasized by conservatives, is a misconception. Our ancestors didn't rely on self-reliance to survive during hard times; it was their compassion, mutual respect, and resource sharing that kept them going. The pioneers who crossed the country in wagon trains didn't achieve their goal alone.\n\nWhile it's essential to be prepared, having a disaster kit or a small farm can only take you so far. True resilience comes from building relationships with those around you, particularly your neighbors. By getting to know them, you'll create a network of support that can help you navigate life's challenges, making a difference in your ability to cope with difficulties.",
            "The mechanisms behind the evolutionary process and the constraints that influence the direction of change are still not fully understood. Although D'Arcy Thompson proposed the idea of using mathematical language to describe organic forms as early as 1917, this concept remains a subject of ongoing study. Recent applications of mathematical modeling have focused on the development and evolution of mollusk skeletons, especially in terms of ontogeny and phylogeny. Our research aims to explore how mathematical modeling in combination with experimental studies can help us understand the underlying mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental changes in the genus Prunum. To achieve this, we have analyzed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that can be used to model and predict hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell, allowing us to create hypothetical shell morphologies that can be used to determine the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. Our findings will be integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to provide a deeper understanding of macroevolutionary events within this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a spiral structure that moves through 360 degrees of space over time. The individual turns or coils of the shell are referred to as whorls, which are thought to rotate around a central axis, known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls grow can vary, and a continuous line divides each whorl, called a suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the last one, known as the body whorl. The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last, while the apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal exits its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nFrom different perspectives, shells can be viewed in apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. The standard orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count the whorls of a shell, one should first view it from the apical perspective and determine the starting point of the first suture. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell, and whorls can be counted from this line, estimating each whorl to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal builds its shell. By tracking the path of the aperture using the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture, it is possible to graphically and mathematically represent this trajectory. Once a mathematical formulation is established, it is then possible to manipulate parameters and modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia has seen little progress in reducing neonatal and infant mortality rates. Although the country is on track to meet several Millennium Development Goals, such as improving access to water and sanitation, its child and maternal health targets are far from being met. To address these shortcomings, a closer examination of the healthcare system is necessary rather than focusing solely on program-specific interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made some progress in increasing the number of births attended by skilled healthcare professionals, with 72% of births now meeting this target. However, this figure includes traditional practitioners, such as midwives, who may not be equipped to handle complications during pregnancy, which contributes to a significant number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. This improvement may be misleading, highlighting the need for further action. Furthermore, there has been a decline in the percentage of children under five years old treated by a healthcare professional for diarrheal cases, and postnatal care data remains incomplete, revealing concerns across the country.\n\nThe cesarean-section rate remains lower than expected at around 4%, and this rate also underscores another pressing issue. The rate of cesarean-sections varies significantly between urban and rural areas, standing at 7% and 2% respectively, indicating a disparity in healthcare access across the country. Moreover, the gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles is substantial, with a 27% difference, suggesting that the poor face significant barriers in accessing healthcare due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nConsidering the next steps for improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the key question revolves around how to effectively address the lack of healthcare services. The question is whether Indonesia should prioritize strengthening its overall health system or adopt program-specific approaches without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children. While programmatic approaches may be appealing due to their targeted objectives and faster results, they also have drawbacks. Investing heavily in one area may divert resources from other areas and create a surge in human resources towards the more funded sector, as seen in the case of HIV/AIDS and family planning. Moreover, running multiple parallel programs can lead to duplication and disorganization of services, increasing administrative burdens and paperwork.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous depiction of the aristocracy during that time period.  Two novels that diverge from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both works employ an element of mystery and an unconventional tone, which helps to enrich the characters within each story, offering deeper insights into their motivations and emotions.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, for instance, the protagonist's inner turmoil is often revealed through dream sequences or trance-like states. These unusual events provide a glimpse into Oliver's inner world, revealing the pain and unease he experiences due to his surroundings. When Oliver relives the shooting scene in chapter 28, it's as if he's reliving it in a dream, symbolizing his loss of control over the events that unfolded. The passage emphasizes Oliver's vulnerability, as his senses are dulled and he's unable to notice the force that's transporting him away from the scene. This event reinforces the notion that Oliver's fate is not entirely in his hands, and that he's subjected to forces beyond his control. This sense of powerlessness is further highlighted by Oliver's inability to take action to change his circumstances, even when his life is at risk. It's implied that his experiences have led to a growing sense of defeat, as if he's been broken by the hardships he's faced, leaving him without the will to resist or take control.\n\nIn a similar vein, Wuthering Heights features a dreamlike narrative that blurs the lines between reality and fantasy. The passage from Wuthering Heights describes a scene where the protagonist is overwhelmed by a cacophony of sounds and visuals, leaving him disoriented and struggling to make sense of his surroundings. The experience is characterized by an undefined sense of pain and unease, which persists and torments him relentlessly. This dreamlike state is a recurring theme in both novels, used to explore the characters' inner worlds and emotional struggles.\n\nThe use of dream sequences in these novels serves to highlight the characters' lack of agency and their vulnerability to external forces. By blurring the lines between reality and fantasy, the authors create a sense of uncertainty and ambiguity, leaving the reader questioning the nature of reality and the characters' place within it. This narrative technique also allows the authors to delve deeper into the characters' emotions and motivations, providing a more nuanced understanding of their experiences and the world they inhabit.",
            "It has been a few years since I worked in an after-school program where I tutored elementary school students. I made it my goal to assist them in any subject they struggled with, but my strengths were in English and reading. I was approached by an instructor to work with a boy named Adrian, who was having trouble reading. At first, I noticed something peculiar - he could pronounce certain letters flawlessly, but struggled with others. It wasn't until I met Adrian's mother that I realized the source of the issue: he knew the English alphabet, but not its pronunciation. This experience has stuck with me and serves as a reminder of the language barrier in schools, particularly in California. It highlights that even children who speak perfect English can face significant challenges with reading.\n\nI share this story to emphasize the issue of language barriers in schools and to demonstrate that it's not always as apparent as we think. Even children who speak English fluently can struggle with reading. This problem is a common challenge that everyone agrees exists. In Adrian's case, his issue was relatively simple to address: additional tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children who barely speak English, the solution is far more complex. There is no single answer, but rather a combination of approaches. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, or other methods alone will not solve this problem. Instead, the key lies in implementing a combination of these strategies.\n\nThe dual language system is a promising approach that can benefit not only children who speak Spanish as their first language but also all children. Research has shown that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns that this approach is resource-intensive and only benefits a small percentage of students, the evidence contradicts this claim. If implemented widely, this approach could benefit all students. To achieve this, we don't need all teachers to be bilingual, which is unrealistic and impractical. However, we can still utilize bilingual aids, tutors, or other support staff to help bridge the language gap.",
            "From a young age, many of us are taught there is something greater than ourselves, something we can't fully comprehend.  Some attend church, temple, or other faith-based institutions to learn about it, while others seek answers within themselves.  Many people accept the faith they were raised with, but some reject the idea of anything beyond their own understanding.  We may adopt a set of values as children, only to change them later as we grow and mature.  No matter which path we choose, we strive to define ourselves through our unique perspectives on spirituality.  We seek guidance and a sense of direction in life.\n\nOne afternoon, my father shared with me the bird he loved the most, the cardinal, while we sat on our front porch during a rainstorm.  As we smoked, the rain pounded against the tin roof above, and the downspouts carried the water down, drowning the plants beside us.  My father stared out into the rain, lost in thought, his eyes displaying a mix of searching and reminiscing.  He'd been struggling with his health, and his appearance had changed significantly.  We avoided eye contact, and I felt a deep sense of isolation, fear, and the inability to discuss my impending loss with him.  I sought comfort by hugging him, sitting down beside him, and gazing out into the rain alongside him.\n\nMy father passed away in December, just five days after my 22nd birthday.  The treatments had prolonged his life beyond the projected timeframe, but they only increased his suffering.  I couldn't understand the purpose of prolonging his pain.  In the silence of the night, I stopped praying, as I questioned whether a higher power had ever truly listened to me. \n\nI chose not to watch my father's final moments, unable to bear the thought of witnessing the life that shaped me come to an end.  I preferred to remember my father through the happy memories, not the sorrow of his passing.  I was convinced that he wouldn't have wanted me to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball on my bed for three days, waiting to hear the news.  Unfortunately, no one even called me to offer their condolences.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is inherently contradictory, as it combines the concepts of 'old' and 'new,' as described by Ian Watt in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been met with mixed reactions, ranging from criticism for its perceived lack of depth to praise for its ability to evoke a sense of the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The origin of the Gothic genre can be attributed to Horace Walpole's novel The Castle of Otranto, which drew inspiration from both ancient and modern romance styles to create a new form of literary expression. Walpole's work incorporated elements of medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions, blending them with the novel's modern format to create a unique storytelling experience. At the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication, the term \"Gothic\" was associated with outdated or unsophisticated concepts, as society and literature were advancing. The combination of Gothic elements and the novel's format, which allowed readers to gain a more intimate understanding of characters' psychology, contributed to the genre's enduring appeal and ability to seem both outdated and new to readers from different eras.\n\nThe concept of chivalry is a prominent theme in Gothic novels, including The Castle of Otranto. The medieval ideal of chivalry, which emphasized the qualities of a noble knight, such as bravery, honor, and competence, was retained and reinterpreted in the original Gothic novel. Chivalry held significant importance for Gothic writers like Walpole, as it represented an idealized and romanticized notion of the past, hinting at the future development of the Romantic movement. Through the use of chivalric concepts and mannerisms, the Gothic past was glorified, aiming to improve the present. Walpole, writing during a tumultuous period in history, was skeptical about the morality and goodness of his contemporaries, as seen in his portrayal of characters like Frederic. This character embodies many chivalric traits, including his status as a prince, his experience of tragedy, and his supposed heroism. The description of Frederic as a gallant and courteous knight is an exaggerated representation, which introduces the Gothic trope of excess, highlighting the genre's inclination towards over-the-top storytelling.",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the comprehensive process of moving goods from the initial customer order through various stages, including raw materials, production, supply, and distribution to the end customer. The concept of supply chain management was introduced by Keith Oliver, a consultant, in 1982. According to Keith Oliver, it involves planning, implementing, and controlling all aspects of the supply chain to meet customer needs efficiently and effectively. The supply chain comprises six critical components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information.\n\nBusiness managers utilize these six key elements to deliver exceptional customer service. Production is the foundation of the supply chain process, requiring careful planning of 'what,' 'when,' 'where,' and 'how' to produce products. Understanding customer demands is crucial for production planning, and this can be achieved by analyzing market trends, which serve as a significant indicator of customer needs. Once market analysis is complete, managers can decide on the products to produce, their quantities, and the optimal production location to meet customer expectations. This decision-making process also involves scheduling workloads, equipment maintenance, and ensuring that production aligns with customer satisfaction.\n\nEvery detail in the production process is vital, and any misstep can result in significant time and financial losses for the company in the long run. A well-structured process, as seen in companies like Wal-Mart and Target, which have established detailed guidelines for various aspects of their business, helps prevent confusion and ensures a smooth workflow. The second essential element of supply chain management is supply, which involves making strategic decisions to determine a company's core capabilities and identify potential outsourcing partnerships. This may involve dividing production into various divisions, each with specialized equipment, workers, and expertise. Outsourcing certain tasks to other companies can help achieve velocity – the ability to provide quality, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness – while maintaining low costs.",
            "The sign held by Ellen Page, star of the film Juno, bears a haunting message: 'Hitler is alive in Burma.'  The statement is a reference to the country now known as Myanmar, a Southeast Asian nation ruled by a ruthless military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, the country witnessed a wave of street protests, dubbed 'The Saffron Revolution,' as thousands of Burmese monks took to the streets, donning their distinctive orange robes. Although the government initially allowed the peaceful demonstrations, the situation quickly escalated into violence, with the military cracking down on the monks and foreign journalists, resulting in the tragic death of a Japanese photojournalist. Estimates of the death toll vary, with some sources suggesting that the true number of fatalities may be in the thousands.\n\nThis is a recurring theme throughout history, where governments have consistently sought to suppress dissent and maintain control over their citizens. From ancient Rome's autocratic rulers to modern-day leaders, the desire for absolute power has been a persistent pattern. Notable examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, where the government brutally suppressed a gathering of intellectuals, activists, and students, and the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, in which Hutu militia groups, backed by the government, systematically targeted Tutsis and moderate ethnic groups. Another infamous example is the Nazi regime's 'Third Reich,' where millions of people, particularly those of Jewish descent, were rounded up and killed. These events serve as stark reminders of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of protecting human rights and freedoms.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting impact on jazz can be attributed to his remarkable longevity and exceptional ability to shape his orchestra creatively. Although he often played subtly on the piano in many of his compositions, as a composer, Ellington excelled at crafting intricate, complex pieces that showcased the unique talents of each band member. By designing a framework that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also writing tightly orchestrated passages that highlighted the distinct styles of individual musicians, Ellington achieved a coherent and original sound for each piece. His mastery of the unique timbres of his players, combined with his understanding of how they blended together in an ensemble, enabled him to create some of the most innovative and brilliant jazz pieces in history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes Ellington's innovative approach to incorporating the voice as a jazz instrument, exemplified in his early work \"Creole Love Call.\" This piece demonstrates Ellington's ability to use the human voice to add texture and color without relying on lyrics, setting it apart from other musical forms. The song features a slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues structure with six distinct choruses. These choruses showcase Ellington's skill in combining different musical elements, including call-and-response patterns, soloists, and instrumental textures.\n\nIn \"Creole Love Call,\" the first chorus features a call-and-response exchange between the voice and reeds, which transitions from smooth to rough. The second chorus features a muted trumpet solo that expands on the melody, emphasizing extended notes. The third chorus showcases a clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle piano phrase with syncopated rhythms. The fourth chorus has the full band echoing the first chorus, with call-and-response interactions between the brass and reed sections. The fifth chorus is climactic, with the reeds initiating the call-and-response pattern in a high register, accompanied by syncopated rhythms from the brass and rhythm sections. The sixth and final chorus returns to the structure of the first, with call-and-response between the voice and reeds, this time featuring the voice using the \"growl\" technique to solo like an instrument. A brief tag concludes the piece with a vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending.\n\nEllington's use of the human voice to add tonal depth to his compositions is a recurring theme throughout his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year after \"Creole Love Call,\" Ellington combines his skill in arranging complex orchestral textures with his sensitivity to tonal color. The call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich and complementary sound by combining vocal and instrumental elements. In \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" Ellington leverages the unique talent of Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a prominent member of his orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone, further showcasing his ability to bring out the best in his musicians.",
            "She had a persistent feeling of incompleteness that began when she was 14 and had continued for three years. It wasn't until she turned 17 that she realized she was looking for a romantic connection rather than a material one. Despite her age, she found herself uninterested in any of the boys she encountered. She frequently questioned why she felt this way, but her introspection couldn't provide a clear explanation. As a result, she continued to go about her life, often pondering her desires.\n\nOn a typical day at home, her parents were known for their calm demeanor and infrequent arguments. In fact, the only disagreements they had were about her strong will and independent nature, which often clashed with their laid-back personalities. She was a lively and likable person who balanced out her parents' calmness. However, this day was different. While searching for new ideas, she was startled by a loud cry and the distress in her mother's voice coming from the kitchen. Rushing to the scene, she frantically asked, \"Mom, what's wrong?\" and found her mother lying on the ground in pain. She quickly put a hand on her mother's shoulder to offer support and asked her to clarify the situation. Her mother, struggling to speak, managed to utter, \"I need you to take me to the hospital.\" Realizing her mother was in severe pain, she offered to drive her and carefully helped her mother into the car. \n\nThe hospital's sterile atmosphere was filled with the scent of disinfectant and the air of concern. Despite the sense of unease that surrounded her, the daughter's focus was solely on her mother. She swiftly carried her into the hospital and called for medical assistance. The doctors and nurses quickly attended to her mother, and the daughter was left to anxiously wait for updates on her mother's condition. It turned out that her mother had fallen off a step stool while trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "The study aimed to assess the relationship between adherence to a Mediterranean Diet, as reflected in an \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" and the risk of chronic heart disease and stroke. This diet is characterized by high consumption of plant-based foods, such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, as well as monounsaturated fats and fish, and lower intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is also allowed.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that adhering to the Mediterranean Diet is associated with a lower risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, and an intervention trial found it to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving cholesterol levels in obese individuals. However, research on the specific link between the Mediterranean Diet and stroke mortality has been limited.\n\nThe study in question followed a cohort of 74,886 women aged 38-63 without a history of heart disease or diabetes, who were part of the Nurses' Health Study. Over a 20-year period from 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score six times, using self-reported food frequency questionnaires that assessed nutrient intake over the past year. The questionnaires were validated through multiple studies, and reports of heart disease, stroke, and other health outcomes were confirmed through medical records and other official documents. When records were not available, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included in the analysis, representing about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal heart attacks.\n\nThe analysis controlled for various factors that could influence the results, such as body mass index, smoking status, physical activity, and medication use. To minimize individual variability and accurately represent long-term dietary habits, the researchers averaged the aMed scores from repeated questionnaires. The study used Cox proportional-hazard modeling to assess the relationship between the aMed score and the risk of heart disease and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal outcomes.\n\nThe results showed that a higher aMed diet score was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths were recorded. Women with the highest aMed diet scores were found to be at lower risk for both heart disease and stroke compared to those with the lowest scores, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The United States experienced a severe financial crisis in 2007, marked by a rise in unemployment, a collapse of the housing market, and the downfall of several major corporations. This ongoing economic downturn has raised important questions about the causes of the crisis and how to prevent similar events in the future. The crisis was primarily triggered by ill-conceived and shortsighted policies that pushed banks and financial institutions to issue sub-prime loans within a fragile and underdeveloped financial framework. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were under pressure to purchase and package these high-risk mortgages into complex securities, which ultimately led to a chain reaction of financial instability when borrowers defaulted on their loans. As a result, the banks found themselves with insufficient capital reserves and were forced to transfer the chaos to the securities they had sold and the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the crisis can be traced back to the Clinton administration's policies in the late 1990s, when it relaxed lending restrictions in an attempt to boost President Clinton's popularity. This move inadvertently set the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. As reported by Steven Holmes of the New York Times in 1999, Fannie Mae was under pressure from the government to increase mortgage lending to low- and moderate-income individuals, while also meeting the expectations of its shareholders for continued growth. Holmes correctly predicted the potential consequences of these actions, warning that the government-subsidized corporation might face financial difficulties in a downturn, requiring a government bailout similar to the one for the savings and loan industry in the 1980s. Unfortunately, the warnings went unheeded, and the economy eventually suffered a devastating collapse.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the proliferation of complex mortgage instruments such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These innovations created a web of interconnectedness between the housing market and other sectors of the economy, leaving households and financial markets vulnerable to even slight changes in the housing market. The result was a housing bubble that eventually burst, causing widespread financial instability. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for approximately 30% of the country's GDP. The crisis ultimately led to the collapse of several major financial institutions, including Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers, while others, such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, were forced to undergo significant regulatory changes. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in 2008.",
            "Ah, the infamous exposition - that part of your story where you spread your creative wings, only to risk losing your readers' interest with an overabundance of background information. Or, worse still, you might inadvertently put them to sleep or prompt them to hit the back button in frustration. Dr. Merlin has been known to lash out at her screen when she finds herself bogged down in unnecessary details, and it's far from an enjoyable experience.\n\nExposition is not a trusted ally in the world of writing. Many readers are already familiar with the fundamental tip \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself slipping into lengthy passages that fail to propel the plot forward. It's a common pitfall that can be avoided by recognizing the temptation to present a character's backstory or history at the expense of engaging storytelling.\n\nExposition is essentially the act of telling the audience about events, typically in a straightforward manner. In film, this can be seen when one character shares an excessive amount of information with another, much like the infamous \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, the author is responsible for embedding exposition into the narrative.\n\nLet's consider an example. Imagine reading a story where the heroine's past is summarized in a few sentences: \"She met her beloved at a certain place and time, got married in a grand ceremony, and witnessed her husband's tragic demise.\" You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to span multiple pages, with the characters having barely a few lines of conversation. Instead, you would expect the author to delve deeper into the husband's character by showing his love through his words and actions, and to explore the heroine's transformation through the impact of her husband's presence in her life. This would enable you to develop an emotional connection with the characters and gain insight into their thoughts, beliefs, and dreams.\n\nIn essence, you would expect more substance to be added to the basic storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\" As a writer, it's your responsibility to provide this depth and richness. While it can be tempting to rush through certain details, it's essential to resist the urge to oversimplify your characters' backgrounds and personalities. For instance, when introducing a new character, you might be tempted to reveal their entire history, from their time in the Air Force to their current role as a night manager at a gas station, including their past marriages and weekend fishing trips. However, it's crucial to avoid overwhelming the reader with too much information and instead opt for a more nuanced and engaging approach.",
            "I watched the morning news from NBC 4 in Columbus, Ohio on August 13, 2011. The live broadcast featured a story about a man from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. Although the wife's name was not mentioned, the husband, Shad Hostettler, was identified, and his mugshot was shown, which appeared to be quite disturbing. The news team devoted approximately two minutes to this developing story, which was sufficient given the circumstances. \n\nAnother story covered a shooting in the Sharon Woods area, where an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers was shot and critically injured. At that time, there were no arrests or suspects, and the SWAT team was investigating. I felt that this story was brief, and I suspect it might have been due to the fact that the victim was a minority and the incident occurred in a predominantly black neighborhood. This observation is consistent with my long-held perception that the media often glosses over crimes committed against minorities. \n\nFollowing that, the news reported on a gunshot wound discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. The authorities believed they knew where the incident occurred and mentioned that the damage was caused by a .22 caliber rifle bullet. A $5,000 reward was being offered for any information that could lead to the capture of the perpetrator. \n\nThe next story was about a forecast for thunderstorms and rain on Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to remain in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. The news team kept this segment brief, using it as a teaser to encourage viewers to stay tuned. \n\nAdditionally, the news covered a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus, which was committed by a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. He was described as being about six feet tall and 150 pounds. I found it unusual that the news emphasized the perpetrator's black skin tone and darkness.\n\nFinally, the broadcast featured a story about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas-based marijuana kingpin who had been found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. It was interesting to note that the news anchor chose to describe his sentence as 300 months rather than 25 years. I am uncertain whether this was an attempt to make the sentence sound more severe or not. The news also highlighted Rodriguez's Hispanic background, which seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "A profound connection exists between brothers, transcending words and emotions. This unbreakable bond encompasses a multitude of feelings - love, pride, envy, and even cruelty - making it difficult to fully comprehend. Brothers possess an uncanny understanding of one another, often seeing in each other a reflection of themselves. It is in the face of extreme adversity that the true nature of this bond reveals itself, whether it be positive or negative. The consequences of these emotions can be severe. To grasp the depth of the emotions tied to this fraternal link, one must accept the repercussions that accompany them. When a brother looks into the eyes of another and sees their own reflection, they gain insight into themselves, not as others perceive them, but as they genuinely are. Their true character is ultimately reflected in their actions and the outcomes of those actions. This theme is explored in James Hurst's \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" a tale of two brothers navigating the complex emotions that come with their relationship. Against the backdrop of a vividly described landscape, these brothers embark on a doomed journey. As their story unfolds, bitter disappointment collides with intense pride in a climactic confrontation, resulting in the survival of only one brother. Through the protagonist, the narrator, and their interactions, the narrative conveys the intricate emotions and worldviews that influence the protagonist's actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single dominant emotion: pride. From the outset, he feels resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle, as the latter's fragile health makes it impossible for him to participate in the activities the protagonist had envisioned for them. The protagonist's dreams of a brother to share experiences with, like exploring the outdoors, are shattered by Doodle's condition. This realization sparks a mix of anger and disappointment within the protagonist, who even contemplates infanticide in a moment of desperation. However, a fleeting glimpse of his brother's smile gives him hope, revealing a deeper love for Doodle that exists beneath his surface-level emotions. This juxtaposition of feelings highlights the complexity of the protagonist's character and the turmoil he experiences as he grapples with the reality of his brother's limitations.",
            "The brain is an intricate and dynamic mechanism for processing information. As technology evolved, the comparisons used to describe it have also become more sophisticated. Initially, the brain was likened to a wax tablet, followed by a sheet of papyrus, a book, and finally a computer. However, it's essential to remember that these comparisons have their limitations and can lead to inaccurate conclusions. \n\nThe process of processing information in the brain begins with the reception of data from sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, temperature, sound waves, and light into electrical signals. The sensory information is then continuously processed through the brain's algorithms, both from the bottom up and from the top down. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing integrates basic information such as color, orientation, and border definition to conclude that it's seeing a box. Meanwhile, top-down processing utilizes the decisions made at earlier stages to facilitate faster object recognition, such as identifying the object as a black box rather than a hole in the background.\n\nOnce information reaches a certain level of processing, an attention filter determines its significance and decides which cognitive processes it should be made accessible to. An example is when your brain processes every blade of grass when looking down at your shoes, but a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing each individual blade. Conversely, you'll more likely notice your name even in a noisy environment. There are various stages of processing, and attention modulates the results repeatedly.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it first needs to store it. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information must be encoded, with different encoding methods applicable to each type of sensory stimulus. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on its visual appearance, sound, or meaning. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Research on animals suggests that working memory, which retains information for approximately 20 seconds, is sustained through an electrical signal that loops through a particular sequence of neurons for a short duration. On the other hand, long-term memory is hypothesized to be sustained through the structure of specific types of proteins.\n\nThere are numerous theories on how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on how humans retrieve memories, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that there are nodes representing concepts, and the nodes are connected based on their relatedness. For instance, in the semantic network, the concept \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the impending threats posed by technology and the capitalist framework that sustains it in his dystopian novel, Brave New World. The society depicted values collective harmony above individuality, conditioning its citizens from the outset to prioritize immediate gratification above all else. The inhabitants are portrayed as pawns in a larger game, bound by a single ideology dictated by the World Controller. When examined through the lens of Marxist ideology, Huxley's work reveals his underlying skepticism towards the emergence of these systems. The novel's use of Marxist terminology, such as homogeny and reification, reinforces the notion that it is a commentary on the flaws in the economic systems of Huxley's time.\n\nThe novel satirizes capitalism by employing the Marxist concept of false consciousness. It suggests that the common people are prevented from understanding their true relationships with other social classes due to their primary focus on personal gain. This is exemplified by the conditioning of the population through hypnopædia, which reinforces the drive to consume, spend, and indulge. The World Controller manipulates the population in this manner, as seen in the actions of the lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, who have no genuine autonomy. Their will is instead shaped by the desires instilled in them, making them complicit in their own oppression.\n\nThe concept of hegemony, where a dominant group exercises control over other social classes, is also evident in Brave New World. The lower classes are unaware of their manipulation, literally buying into an ideology that perpetuates the existing power structure. The upper classes, comprising Alphas and Betas, are either unaware or unresponsive to the manipulation, with few exceptions like Bernard, who merely accepts his position. The novel's portrayal of the social classes' interactions is a significant indication of the perceived effects of capitalist oppression.\n\nThe relationships between individuals in Brave New World are superficial, lacking depth and emotional complexity. Huxley may be suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together erode human free will and expression. Love and intense emotions are absent, replaced by shallow interactions focused on physical appearance, as seen in the characters' comments about women and their encounters. The complacency of each social class with their position in the hierarchy and their absolute obedience to their role in the community reflect the Marxist notion of the proletariat, who are misled into believing their superiority is guaranteed as long as they conform to societal expectations.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for about two and a half years, which equates to four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, navigating the campus can be a significant challenge. In my first year, I lived in East Halls, which is one of the farthest residential areas from the main campus, excluding the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. Moving from my home in Stuart Hall to classrooms in buildings such as the Willard building, located near the center of campus, often took around 25 minutes on foot, especially during adverse weather conditions, which are common in State College. During a conversation with an alumnus not much older than me, I discovered that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the university by large stretches of unused land. However, this vacant space has since been transformed into sports fields, new buildings, and surrounding apartments. As the campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another is becoming increasingly difficult. The most effective solution to this mobility issue on a college campus is undoubtedly the bicycle. However, simply having a bike is not enough; students need to use it regularly, and the campus infrastructure should be designed with cyclists' needs in mind.\n\nTalking to a friend who had recently recommenced biking after a several-year break, I found out that he was wondering why he had stopped. He said, \"Bikes are great,\" and that for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it is the only efficient way to get around.\" In addition to being beneficial for one's health, bicycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical exertion can take you 30 miles or more. As an off-campus resident, I live as far from the campus center as some dorms. This year, I made the smart decision to purchase a bike. With classes in Thomas building, which takes around 25 minutes to walk from my home, riding a bike can significantly cut down the travel time to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly enough. However, my route to Thomas building, Pollock Road, is not the most convenient or safe option for biking. There are also advantages to walking, but personally, I am too busy to walk. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable means of getting to class, which would require an extra 30-40 minutes from my daily schedule, translating to over two and a half hours per week. Adding this to the additional time spent walking to and from other classes, appointments, and other commitments would leave me with no time to spare."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "My goal is to pursue a career in social work within the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on helping children who have been abused or neglected, and supporting troubled families. Key values that I will bring to this field include service, respect, an ethical approach, and a commitment to enhancing relationships and continued professional development. These core values are not only essential for social workers but also hold significant importance for me on a personal level.\n\nThroughout my high school and college years, I've always been drawn to helping others, but I wasn't certain about the specific career path I wanted to follow. Observing individuals who struggled with problems and often used inadequate coping mechanisms, I decided to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break, but a life-changing encounter with a troubled teenager that summer led me to reconsider my career path. I met a 16-year-old boy who was visiting his friend to escape an abusive home environment. The next day, he called the police, and I accompanied them to his parents' house, where I expressed my concerns and shared my recent graduation from Piedmont College with a degree in Psychology. The police asked me to talk to the parents, as they were unable to intervene due to legal limitations. When I questioned the parents, they seemed evasive and made excuses for their son's behavior, labeling it as manipulative. This experience sparked my serious consideration of a career in social work, which would allow me to help children resolve conflicts within their families.\n\nSocial justice is another essential value for the field of social work. As a society, we emphasize the importance of the individual but often prioritize conformity over uniqueness. This paradox has always puzzled me. If we mourn the loss of individuals, why do we strive to be like everyone else? I am an individual who refuses to conform to societal norms. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively protested against social injustices, expressing myself through non-traditional fashion choices, advocating for social justice causes, and standing up against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it. I strongly believe in social justice and will continue to advocate for it.",
            "This paper examines the relationship between biological and sociocultural factors in the context of insomnia. The biological model centers on the genetic and medical aspects that contribute to the disorder, such as inherited traits and physiological factors. In contrast, the sociocultural model explores how environmental influences, including demographic and socioeconomic factors, impact an individual's sleep patterns. The forthcoming review of insomnia research will delve into these models, analyzing the selected studies that shed light on and support these theories. The findings of these studies will be critiqued, highlighting their strengths and limitations.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders associated with other mental health conditions, or sleep disorders caused by other factors. The primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias and Parasomnias, while sleep disorders linked to mental health conditions are tied to Axis I or II disorders. Other categories of sleep disorders can arise from medical complications or substance intake. Dyssonmias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Primary Insomnia involves difficulty maintaining adequate sleep, whereas Primary Hypersomnia involves excessive daytime sleepiness, both lasting at least a month. Narcolepsy is characterized by cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. On the other hand, Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral or physiological anomalies. These include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The review focuses on insomnia and its relationship to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model examines the genetic, heritable, and physiological aspects of sleep disorders. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study using mice found that the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons is responsible for sleep-wake states. Activating the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibiting it reduces anxiety and induces sleep. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep duration in the study (Matsuki et al., 2009). The findings suggest that animal models can be applied to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. The absence or malfunction of this receptor could affect an individual's ability to sleep naturally without medication. From a sociocultural perspective, if the receptor's phenotype is inherited, it could influence sleep patterns, and any alterations to the receptor could disrupt sleep, impacting daily life, including academic and professional responsibilities, and routine tasks that require focus and concentration.",
            "This paper explores three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, the disorder is defined, and a clear understanding of its meaning is provided. The next section delves into its diagnosis, highlighting common signs or indicators, also known as \"red flags.\" Finally, the paper concludes by offering practical advice on how a teacher in a mainstream classroom can support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) refers to how efficiently the central nervous system processes auditory information. Essentially, it is a condition where the brain struggles to interpret sounds, despite the person having normal hearing abilities. People with CAPD are not considered deaf or hard of hearing, but they may struggle to distinguish between different sounds, separate background noise from meaningful conversations, or differentiate between words. \n\nThe concept of CAPD originated in the mid-1950s, initially referred to as \"auditory imperception.\" In 1954, Italian researchers began developing tests to identify children with communication disorders, and in 1961, a Japanese researcher introduced a method called dichotic testing to understand the brain's physiology. A national conference in 1977 further sparked research into CAPD.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways, including difficulties with sound localization, recognizing sound patterns, or differentiating changes in speech. Individuals with CAPD may struggle to filter out background noise, understand sarcasm through tone of voice, or follow the sequence of auditory information. They may also experience sound blocking or have difficulty interpreting sounds in a meaningful way. \n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a comprehensive assessment is necessary, which may involve observing listening behaviors and performance on auditory function tests conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals. Various measures are used to evaluate auditory-related skills, including questionnaires, surveys, and observation of auditory responses to certain stimuli. Currently, there is no single, widely accepted diagnostic tool or test for CAPD, and the underlying cause of the disorder remains unknown. Some tests present the patient with multiple sounds simultaneously and ask them to differentiate between them, while more advanced tests involve recording and measuring the brain's response to acoustic signals within the ear.",
            "The play Twelfth Night suggests that while disguises can be useful in deceiving others, they can ultimately lead to a loss of identity if not abandoned. However, giving up a deception can also result in feelings of isolation, as one may be rejected by those who were misled. This leaves individuals with a difficult choice between preserving their own identity and maintaining their relationships with others, who may react negatively to the truth. The issue of deception in Twelfth Night, particularly through gender role reversal, raises additional questions, such as why someone would choose to conceal their true identity and adopt a disguise. For instance, in Viola's case, she felt compelled to disguise herself as a man to protect herself from potential harm after arriving in a foreign land. \n\nThis disguise allowed her to avoid danger but also led to her separation from the support system of women and created complications in her relationships, including Olivia's mistaken attraction to her and suppressed romantic feelings towards Orsino. Although this may seem progressive to modern readers, Twelfth Night can also be seen as a study of how deception can bring suppressed emotions to the surface, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. The play hints at the possibility that these characters may have repressed desires that are revealed through Viola/Cesario's presence. For example, Olivia's switch in affection from Cesario to Sebastian suggests that her initial attraction was superficial and based on appearance, aligning with the societal judgments of Olivia's time. This interpretation is further supported by her eventual shift in perception of Cesario/Viola, viewing her as family rather than a romantic interest.",
            "German colonial rule was marked by brutality, particularly in its treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, the colonial empire's policies and governance varied significantly across its territories, mirroring its diverse geography. This diversity was also reflected in the provision of education, with some colonies experiencing notable success in educating and literate their populations. For instance, when Britain took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a well-educated and literate African population. Similarly, German efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were praised as effective by contemporary observers.\n\nIn stark contrast, South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a drastically different scenario. Unlike East Africa, where the government played a significant role in native education, the task of educating the local population in South West Africa was largely left to missionary societies that received limited government support. Notably, however, the government invested heavily in educating Europeans in the colony, establishing state schools and regulating missionary schools with significant support. This disparity in educational policies had lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule ended. Unlike other German colonies, which boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, the majority of the population in South West Africa remained uneducated and illiterate. Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this disparity.\n\nThis paper seeks to expand the discussion by examining these factors and giving particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans. A wealth of literature exists on education in the German colonial empire, but most of these sources are written in German and focus on describing the features of educational systems. Later studies in English offered comparative analyses of education in the various German colonies, highlighting significant differences in their educational systems. A notable study by Cohen compared the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa, attributing the differences between them to the large settler population in South West Africa. \n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, with a significant portion of the territory being arid desert. This hospitable climate led to a substantial European population, with nearly 15,000 whites residing in South West Africa by 1913, compared to only 5,336 in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population.",
            "Over the past century, the classification of popular music has become increasingly complex due to the proliferation of numerous genres, with many of these genres branching out into multiple sub-genres. This complexity is further exacerbated by the fact that most genres, such as rock, country, jazz, and folk, have spawned numerous sub and sub-sub genres. Among these, the Heavy Metal sub-genre of rock music has emerged as one of the most diverse and expressive in the past 40 years, characterized by its wide range of emotions, predominantly leaning towards the darker end of the emotional spectrum.\n\nIts diversity stems from the early recognition of its flexibility, which allowed artists to create their own sub-genres, followed by sub-sub-genres, and this trend continues to the present day. As a result, the heavy metal movement has branched out into numerous niches, making it challenging to define its core identity. To understand the metal music that exists today, it is essential to grasp the underlying principles and motivations that define the metal movement.\n\nAt its core, the metal movement is characterized by its association with darkness, which can be seen as \"music of excess\" – more emphasis on bass, volume, violence, and theatricality. Musicians in metal bands are highly skilled, evident in their intricate playing styles. Additionally, the movement has a strong connection to the use of psychedelic drugs, which emerged in the 1970s and influenced the creation of avant-garde and otherworldly music. Metal music often incorporates dark and visceral qualities, a departure from the generally lighter tone of popular music. Later generations of metal have drawn inspiration from the Romantic Era's dark and intense qualities. The lyrics of metal songs, such as those in Helter Skelter by the Beatles, exemplify the movement's focus on darkness and the exploration of the human experience.",
            "Before the Surrealist movement emerged, French painter Henri Rousseau was creating works that embodied his own dreams and aspirations. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only captures a woman's wonder at the fantastical world she encounters in her dreams but also reflects Rousseau's internal struggle to balance his desire for recognition with his need for creative freedom. As a painter, Rousseau yearned for the approval of his peers and art enthusiasts, yet he faced an internal conflict: to conform to established styles and gain acceptance from the art world, or to forge his own path and maintain his individuality.\n\nTo understand The Dream, it's essential to know Rousseau's background. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval, northwest France, he came from a relatively affluent family. His father was a successful businessman, but Rousseau himself received no formal art training. Instead, he worked as a municipal toll collector until the age of 40, when he began painting as a way to escape the pain of losing his first wife and eight children. Unlike many of his contemporaries, who romanticized the peasant class, Rousseau's paintings were rooted in his own experiences and the hopes of the ordinary people around him. His quest for acceptance by the art world was fueled by his late start in life and the fact that he began creating art alongside renowned artists like Matisse. As art historian Jan Gordon noted, while both artists were technically competitors, their motivations and styles differed significantly. Matisse sought to avoid clichés in his work, whereas Rousseau aimed to create a conventional piece that would earn him recognition from the prestigious Artiste Français.",
            "The connection between ethics and aesthetics, and truth and beauty, has been a subject of discussion among many prominent thinkers. In my view, this relationship is rooted in a fundamental aspect of human experience. As John Keats poetically conveys in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" beauty and truth are intertwined, and this is all we need to know. While education and experience play a significant role in shaping our understanding of the world, our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seems to be more instinctual, as if we're drawn to them without being explicitly taught. Both ethics and aesthetics are more about describing and explaining concepts rather than providing a set of rules. Our studies of morality and beauty primarily focus on understanding what makes a piece of art or literature beautiful, or an action moral, rather than establishing a set of guidelines for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nMoreover, criticism of art or morals can never fully capture the essence of what is good or beautiful. For instance, a discussion about the Mona Lisa might involve concepts like composition, context, and contrast, but these factors don't fully explain why the painting is considered good art. People often find it difficult to articulate why they love a particular work of art or literature, and they might say something like, \"There's just something about it.\" I believe that art and morals cannot be reduced to a set of descriptive qualities, and both have a transcendent quality that cannot be fully expressed. Flannery O'Connor once said that stories can convey meaning that cannot be put into words, and this is also true for ethics. Ludwig Wittgenstein noted that ethics is transcendental and cannot be expressed. I propose that this ineffable quality is the most powerful aspect of art and morality, and it's this shared transcendent nature that connects them.\n\nI think morality and art are closely related because they both have a profound impact on us at a level that's difficult to put into words. This connection is even stronger in literature, which, as McKean suggests, is distinguished by its moral quality. While moral standards might not be applicable to all art forms, they seem particularly relevant to literature, which is essential to us because of the values it conveys. Living involves values, and literature is a powerful means of exploring and understanding these values.",
            "Germany is a powerful nation with a unique blend of cultures that encompasses the country from the shadows of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel and from Cologne on the Rhine River to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River. This rich cultural heritage is a result of the country's diverse history, shaped by various tribes and influences. \n\nThe term 'Germania' refers to the ancestral homeland of the German people, with its origins being a topic of debate among scholars and historians. According to historical accounts, the name 'Germania' might have originated from the Tungrian tribe or a Germanic tribe that lived before crossing the Rhine River to battle the Gauls. Julius Caesar is credited with using the term 'Germanus' for the first time in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he differentiated between the Gauls he had conquered and the Germanic tribes he had not yet defeated. The term 'Germanus' could be derived from the Gaulish language, referring to a neighboring group, or from the Old Norse word 'ger,' meaning spear, or the Old Irish word 'garim,' meaning 'to shout,' which might describe the loud and boisterous nature of the Germanic tribes.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote extensively about the origins of the Germans in his work 'De Origine et situ Germanorum' around AD 98. According to Tacitus, the Germans were an indigenous people with little to no influence from other cultures. He noted that the Romans did not migrate to Germania, but rather, they visited the region to trade and conquer its resources, while the Germanic tribes engaged in wars with the Romans and other neighboring groups. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the 1st century AD, they interacted with the Roman Empire, trading goods and skills, including serving in the Roman army.",
            "As I gazed downward, my mind was a blank slate, taking in the scene before me without any emotional attachment or analysis.  My thoughts flashed in and out of my consciousness at an incredible pace, leaving no lasting impression.  It was as if my awareness was a fluid, engaged experience, merely observing what lay before me. \n\nAt one point, a friend who was an artist recommended I read \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" to learn about drawing techniques.  I had long been fascinated by drawing since I was six years old, and this book provided a comprehensive guide, covering everything from understanding basic materials to how the brain interprets lines.  One of its key strategies is to frame a picture within a square to simplify its complexities.  For instance, what once appeared as an intricate scene – a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room – can be distilled into a straightforward, simplified image – that same bowl of fruit on a flat surface.\n\nAs I stood before the bowl, I found it impossible to mentally impose this artistic framework.  I was overwhelmed and in awe, unable to do anything but stand there in wonder.  Different artists have their distinct styles, such as Picasso's blue period, Monet's love of greenery, or the Italian Renaissance masters' use of vibrant colors.  If I were to consider myself an artist, this scene before me was the start of my artistic expression, the beginning of \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy hand instinctively reached for the pencil, and as I began to draw, my muscles tensed and relaxed, translating my thoughts into art.  Water droplets and light danced before my eyes, and particles broke away, disappearing into nothingness.  However, my second attempt at drawing was marked by a sudden surge of anxiety, as my hand slapped the handle of the toilet handle in frustration.  Before me lay an unyielding, brown mass that seemed stuck to the bottom of the toilet, an unwelcome gift for the Rite Aid cleaning staff.\n\nWith a mop in hand, my feet shoulder-width apart, and my tie tied uncomfortably tight, I stared at the uninviting, processed matter left behind.  After a few more attempts to flush and moments of introspection, I reached out to grab the roll of toilet paper, wrapping it around my hand like a mitt.  With a slow, deliberate movement, I dipped my mummified hand into the bowl, much like a mother carefully placing a turkey in the oven on Thanksgiving day….",
            "The alarming rate of teenage fatalities behind the wheel is a pressing concern.  Several factors contribute to this tragic statistic, including the fact that the adolescent brain is not fully equipped to handle the risks associated with driving, and the inherent inexperience of young drivers.  This inexperience not only increases the likelihood of fatal accidents but also leads to a higher incidence of rollover accidents, speeding, and driving off the road. \n\nMoreover, when teens drive with their peers, the risk of accidents increases even further.  Research conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center showed a correlation between the age of passengers and the number of traffic accidents.  To address this issue, California and other states have implemented temporary provisional licenses that restrict the hours teens can drive and prohibit minors as passengers.  However, these measures are merely Band-Aid solutions, as the fundamental problem lies in the fact that young drivers, as a group, are statistically unable to adequately manage the risks and responsibilities associated with driving.\n\nExperts, such as psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, argue that even 18-year-olds are not mature enough to handle the demands of driving.  His research suggests that individuals under the age of 19 or 20 have a strong desire for thrill-seeking, which can lead to reckless behavior behind the wheel.  It is logical, therefore, to delay the issuance of driver's licenses until this tendency to take risks has diminished.  If we continue to issue licenses to young teens, we can expect the number of fatal accidents to rise, potentially reaching catastrophic levels.  With the Baby Boomer generation's children soon becoming eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers hitting the roads, the situation is becoming increasingly dire.\n\nA straightforward solution to this issue is to establish a national policy that ensures no one under the age of 18 can operate a vehicle.  Driver's education classes could continue to be provided in schools, and a provisional permit could still be issued before a full license is granted, requiring a certain number of practical driving hours.  The number of hours required could be based on the existing standards set by most states, such as the 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult required in California.  Given that the problem affects drivers across the nation, a uniform, national law would be a reasonable and effective means of protecting young drivers. \n\nMy proposed legislation is not a novel idea, but rather a common-sense solution to a pressing problem.",
            "Upon examining the early films available at the Library of Congress, I decided to review the collection of trick films produced by Edison from 1895 to 1901. This particular subset of films relies heavily on creative editing techniques to create the illusion of something out of nothing. My study primarily focused on analyzing the poetic elements characteristic of most trick films and identifying the distinct features that emerged in some of the later productions. \n\nEarly trick films, which were often set-bound and shot from a fixed position, adhered to a standardized approach that involved using long and medium shots and maintaining a single shot per film. However, there were some groundbreaking films at the beginning of the 20th century that dared to break free from these conventions by incorporating features such as multiple shots. These early films shared a common trait of being shot within an interior set, mimicking the stage setting of a frontal proscenium. The camera remained stationary, never moving to follow characters or objects. This setup was heavily influenced by the theater and vaudeville traditions, where the actors would move laterally, never towards or away from the audience.\n\nOne notable aspect of these early films is the limited movement of actors within the frame. The action in films like \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900) showcases this, where characters enter from one side and move horizontally, staying within the frame. When they exit, the camera remains stationary, not following them off-screen. This composition also led to the minimal use of close-up shots, as the camera would rarely zoom in on a specific detail. Instead, filmmakers relied on long and medium shots, adhering to the traditional theater and vaudeville format where the audience viewed the entire performance from a fixed viewpoint.\n\nThe conventional approach of one shot per film restricted the length of trick films to around a minute or less, depending on the frame rate used. This constraint limited the narrative and dramatic potential of these films, which often focused on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic and disappearing acts, rather than developing a cohesive story. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that a single \"shot\" in a trick film may not always be a single physical shot, but rather a composite of multiple shots cleverly edited together to create an illusion. For example, in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), the physical shot that appears to show Mary's severed head is revealed to be a joined sequence of shots, illustrating the artful manipulation of editing in early film production.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an advocate for the principles of Republicanism, driven by his experiences as an agriculturalist and a brief career in politics. His unwavering commitment to personal freedom and government accountability was a hallmark of his character. His strong agrarian views served as the foundation for his opinions on governance, with a focus on preserving and promoting what he saw as the most superior career path.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a unique opportunity to establish a utopian system, free from the constraints of native traditions that could hinder the development of self-governance. He firmly believed in the inherent rights of individuals, which he considered interdependent and crucial to the well-being of society. He argued that these rights should not be subject to government interference. In his view, the concept of a \"state of nature\" meant that those with physical superiority and malevolent intentions often thrived, but that this should not be the case in a civilized society.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor advocated for a government that acknowledges the duality of human nature, comprising both good and evil. He rigidly adhered to a dualistic morality, stating that a government's virtues and vices are inherently human. He defined virtuous principles as those that protect private property, promote agriculture, and discourage excessive capitalism. Taylor believed that a government grounded in these principles would function equitably, despite the self-interest and avarice that often accompany its administration. He saw self-interest as a natural human motivation, but only considered it evil when it led to the exploitation of others. A good government was necessary to balance human nature, and its principles must be carefully monitored to prevent the introduction of detrimental principles.\n\nLike many Republicans of his time, Taylor championed a strict construction of the Constitution, advocating for a limited federal government with powers explicitly stated in the document. He recognized that a large federal government would be expensive and potentially tyrannical. However, he believed that a literal interpretation of the Constitution, without considering the intent of its authors, could lead to corruption. Furthermore, Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence the true foundation of the United States, as it more explicitly describes the nation as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single entity.",
            "Upon examining Figure 17, a significant drop in commuter log submissions was observed in the third month of the project, which was somewhat disheartening and challenging to explain. The onset of winter at a New England campus likely led to a decrease in bicycle and foot commuting, contributing to this decline. The end of the fall semester in December, coupled with the subsequent holiday season, may have caused the commuter log to fall off the radar for many individuals. Additionally, the prolonged break in late December and early January might have reduced the need for students and faculty to commute to campus. Although classes resumed in late January, the low number of submissions for February remained unexplained. It's possible that the initial enthusiasm for the project naturally waned over time, necessitating strategies to maintain momentum. In response, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a targeted campaign that successfully boosted log submissions for that month. However, sustaining project engagement proved challenging, particularly due to the natural decrease in participation and the added constraints of academic breaks.\n\nOne of the underlying challenges of this project (and similar initiatives) is the widespread preference for personal freedom, independence, and flexibility offered by driving cars. To counter this, it's essential to provide incentives for alternative commuting modes. Throughout the project, we offered gift cards to local businesses, but it would have been intriguing to explore the impact of larger prizes, such as a bicycle, hybrid car, or electric vehicle. This could have potentially mitigated the decline in engagement. The value of the prizes remained constant throughout the project, whereas increasing the prize value over time might have been more effective. Initially, the gift cards seemed sufficient, but announcing additional, higher-value prizes in December (e.g., bicycles) and January (e.g., hybrid or electric cars) could have potentially boosted participation instead of decreasing it.",
            "An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a financial instrument designed to track a specific index, commodity, or collection of assets, similar to an index fund, but with greater flexibility and trading capabilities similar to individual stocks on an exchange.  An ETF offers the diversification benefits of an index fund and the advantages of owning individual stocks, such as short selling, margin buying, and the ability to purchase as few as a single share.  While these benefits are highly appealing, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund.  However, there are some drawbacks, including the requirement to pay commissions for ETF trades, similar to stock transactions.  An additional benefit of ETFs is the wide range of available funds.  To assess the effectiveness of ETFs, it is essential for informed investors to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, actually exist and to what extent.  In this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to determine whether owning a single ETF provides similar benefits to owning a diversified portfolio of the same stocks and whether alternative configurations might offer a more optimal risk-adjusted return.\n\nIn order to simplify the analysis, we have chosen to focus on the top 10 holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets.  We will use the current asset allocation to estimate the contribution of each stock to a portfolio's beta and return if the portfolio were comprised solely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF.  The calculations of beta and return are presented in the following chart.\n\nFrom the chart, it is clear that a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns.  Moreover, the beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF's beta.  Preliminary results suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide higher returns with a lower risk.  Nevertheless, it is possible that the means of the two portfolios may not be statistically different.\n\nTo further assess the statistical difference between these portfolios, we calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, to compare their combined standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" is considered one of his superior works. In this poem, Poe employs the term \"Thulé,\" which has its roots in Virgil. However, it's also tied to a more contemporary source, given Poe's interest in German literature, particularly the works of Goethe. Karl J. Arndt notes the similarity between Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon,\" suggesting that Poe may have been influenced by the latter.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature highlights Goethe's notable work, \"Faust,\" a poetic drama published in two parts, with the second part being released in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Within \"Faust,\" there's a poem called \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells the story of a king who, after his wife's passing, descends into heavy drinking and grief. This character's behavior parallels the description of the king in Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" which can be seen as a dark reflection of the narrator's own struggles with loss and his reliance on drinking. Interestingly, a romantic drama adaptation of \"Faust\" was published in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term Thulé in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe references Thulé twice in his collected works, using the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and employing it as a bookend in \"Dream-Land.\" The two works can be seen as complementary pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a desolate and colorless world, haunted by the presence of deceased friends, much like the King of Thulé, who has lost his wife and is struggling to find purpose.\n\nPoe's familiarity with Goethe's work is also evident through his admiration for Alfred Tennyson, another notable author. Poe's statement on Tennyson suggests that he would have been exposed to Goethe's work through various reproductions and adaptations that were prevalent after the original publication of \"Faust.\"",
            "Under California law, if a customer slips and falls in a grocery store due to an applesauce spill, they might be eligible to receive punitive damages if the store manager was reckless and acted with malicious intent. A judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages without a thorough examination. To justify an award of punitive damages, Palmer must provide evidence that the store manager's actions were taken with a deliberate disregard for the potential harm caused, and that his conduct was reprehensible. Palmer can argue that the manager, Paul Martin, should have known about the potential harm of not cleaning the spill, given that multiple customers had already slipped and fallen at the store in the months preceding Palmer's accident. Additionally, Palmer can argue that Martin's inaction was inexcusable, considering that he had been informed of the spill twice, yet chose to ignore it because he was on dinner break. Although Palmer's claim of Martin's despicable actions may be less convincing, it is still a reasonable argument given the fact that several slip-and-fall incidents had occurred at the store in 2009, and Martin failed to take necessary measures to maintain the store's safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about the applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin responded by stating he was on dinner break and couldn't deal with customer complaints. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin of the spill, but he responded with the same excuse. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, suffering a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, there had been five reported slip-and-fall incidents at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering filing a motion for partial summary judgment on the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The statute defines malice as conduct intending to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when it was committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, where the defendant was aware of the probable consequences of his actions and deliberately failed to avoid them.",
            "It's been almost four years since I took a course on Islam at CBC, and one of the topics that still resonates with me is whether Islam is a hostile religion or not. In my opinion, this question is more relevant today than ever, especially considering the changing media portrayal of Islam in America since 9/11. The fact that a presidential candidate with an obvious Muslim background, such as Barack Obama, was viable in 2008 is a stark contrast to the hostile views that dominated the media in 2001.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad has left an impression on me, as it contrasts with my initial understanding of his history. I had previously believed that Muhammad forced people to convert to Islam, but the biography portrays him as a misunderstood figure who was humble and merciful. According to the account, people were drawn to his teachings, not coerced, and they came to see the truth in his words voluntarily.\n\nInterestingly, there are similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles attributed to Muhammad. For instance, Muhammad's multiplication of food to feed forty men is strikingly similar to the miracles of Jesus. This style of storytelling has made me wonder whether the authors aimed to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove himself, but instead lived a life of truth and miracles. However, this narrative approach downplays the significance of Jesus Christ's life and miracles, making it seem like Muhammad's story is an attempt to co-opt or borrow from Jesus' narrative.\n\nAnother aspect that troubled me about the biography is the reliance on third-party accounts to prove the truth of the stories. While the intention behind this method may have been to provide evidence, it actually diminishes the credibility of the stories and raises suspicions. Furthermore, the portrayal of Muhammad as a gentle and humble man is at odds with historical records, which portray him as a more complex figure. I worry that Muslims today may not be aware of the full history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The Christian teachings and beliefs that Jesus held during his lifetime were initially set aside as Christianity evolved following his passing.  Looking at the broader picture, it's clear that Christianity has drifted further and further from its roots over time.  Today, there's a growing awareness and a progressive shift in the world, particularly among traditional individuals who resist any departure from the original teachings.  However, their influence may not be substantial enough to dictate the course of the religion as a whole.  In the future, a heightened awareness of history among Christians will emerge, and there will be a growing desire to distinguish the doctrines developed over time from Jesus' original intentions.  This reversal will eventually lead to a significant shift in Christian history, as a movement gains momentum, stripping away layers of added doctrine, returning to the core principles Jesus introduced, untainted by the ideas of later thinkers.  This trend will spread across the United States and Europe, influencing the masses, who will return to worshipping in a manner reminiscent of Jesus' time, adhering to his original ideas.  The church as an institution will remain strong, guiding this movement, but the outcome will be a unified, more homogeneous Christian community, with reduced diversity.  As we look at human history, we see that reversals are not uncommon, such as the shift from persecution to the Roman Empire embracing Christianity, or the transformation of the United States from African-American slavery to leadership.  A similar reversal is expected to unfold in the Christian faith, seeking its roots and undoing the diversity that has developed over time.  Crucially, this process will be facilitated by reinterpreting Jesus' words as metaphors rather than literal statements.  To understand this development, we must look back to the earliest roots of Christianity, which originated in Judaism.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., Judaism was already a complex faith with monotheism, divinely revealed scripture, and Hebrew authority at its core.  The Jewish population was not a unified entity, with various groups like Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and common people existing alongside one another.",
            "I firmly believe that beneath the surface, human nature is driven by self-interest and a focus on personal gain. People tend to prioritize their own well-being over others, often disregarding the needs and well-being of those less fortunate. The novel \"The Jungle\" by Upton Sinclair vividly portrays this selfish aspect of human nature through its depiction of the factory owners and managers. These individuals are solely concerned with expanding their businesses and amassing wealth, without regard for the consequences or the harm caused to others. As Sinclair illustrates, the factories' pollution and environmental impact are starkly visible, with massive smokestacks emitting pollutants and animal waste from the overcrowded conditions of the pens.\n\nThe factory owners and managers also exploited their employees, treating them as mere commodities to be used and discarded. They were willing to do whatever it took to increase their profits, even if it meant pushing their workers to their limits and beyond. The novel paints a bleak picture of a system where workers were not valued as individuals, but rather as replaceable assets. The absence of labor laws and regulations during the era enabled the factory owners to operate with impunity, forcing workers to toil in hazardous conditions without any protection or support. The working-class individuals living in Packingtown were expected to endure the harsh conditions of their lives, with no access to resources or organizations that could aid them.\n\nThe labor unions, which were intended to provide support to workers, often ended up perpetuating the system of exploitation. They profited from the struggles of the working-class individuals, further entrenching their exploitation. As a result, the workers were trapped in a cycle of poverty and oppression, described by Sinclair as a form of modern-day slavery. This situation led to widespread immorality and desperation, mirroring the conditions of the old chattel slavery system.",
            "When writing, many authors attempt to evoke a particular sentiment or attitude in their readers towards significant subjects. Some techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs a range of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. One such method involves combining an adjective and a noun in an unconventional way to create a distinct aura around a subject. Another technique is assigning meaning to a symbol and then utilizing it to convey a specific feeling. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald frequently employs the latter technique with various colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. \n\nFitzgerald establishes meaning for colors, particularly white/gray, and later leverages this meaning to evoke a particular feeling in relation to a crucial object. The meaning he creates for white/gray is related to uniformity, with white being associated with a sense of refinement and higher social standing, while gray is linked to something older and faded. \n\nAt the beginning of the novel, Fitzgerald sets up this meaning by consistently using both colors. Characters such as Daisy and Jordan are frequently depicted wearing white, while the narrator, Nick, observes that everyone at a party is dressed in white. However, the only time this is not the case is when Nick is describing his initial impressions of Gatsby's party, where the atmosphere is described as gaudy with primary colors. Fitzgerald further reinforces these color associations by applying them to ordinary, unremarkable subjects, such as buildings and people. He describes Nick's daily commute to work as traveling through \"white chasms of lower New York,\" and the names of people at Gatsby's party appear as \"gray names\" on Nick's schedule. He also uses white or gray to describe ordinary people or places, like Jordan and Daisy's shared \"white girlhood\" or the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes. \n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established the meaning of white/gray, he uses them to signify a lack of importance or uniformity in certain subjects. This technique begins with the character of Daisy. After a period of relative absence from these colors, Fitzgerald begins to associate Daisy with white, portraying her as dressed in a \"little white roadster.\" This depiction reduces Daisy to a uniform, almost anonymous figure, someone Gatsby longs for but does not truly understand. Fitzgerald employs this technique repeatedly to reinforce the idea that Daisy is more of an idealized concept than a fully fleshed-out character, as seen in her wearing a \"gray haze of fur collar\" or another \"white\" dress before the encounter between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County's favorable climate allows for a thriving agricultural sector, with a variety of crops being cultivated, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, and peppers. The region has a strong demand for organic, community-supported agriculture food, resulting in long waiting lists for local organizations. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Many organic farms in the area offer tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. By adopting organic farming practices, landowners can benefit from government programs while also preserving and enhancing the local ecosystem.\n\nIn addition to catering to a lucrative niche market, organic farming brings several environmental benefits, such as increased biodiversity and a healthier environment, due to the absence of chemical use in farming. However, organic farming comes with higher costs and labor requirements compared to conventional farming, as it demands more intensive labor and management to control pests, weeds, and soil fertility without the use of chemicals. Organic farms often face greater losses and lack the efficiency of large-scale operations. Furthermore, practices that benefit wildlife, such as planting cover crops, rotational grazing, and invasive species removal, can also incur higher labor costs. As a result, landowners may seek financial assistance or expert guidance to maximize both profits and environmental quality.\n\nThe selected land parcel is situated in unincorporated San Diego County, California, adjacent to the town of Potrero, and comprises 160 acres of chaparral, Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. The East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan protects over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and several butterfly species, while others are declining and may soon be listed, including the burrowing owl.\n\nThis area has been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries and was later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. As part of an original homestead patent, the land was likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many years. To explore the possibilities for a small farmer in this region, a piece of property was selected from a real estate website, and relevant government programs were researched to identify potential cost-saving options and wildlife-friendly practices. An existing organic farm in the same area served as a model for this hypothetical scenario.",
            "Culture holds significant weight in the negotiation process. Culture encompasses a broad spectrum of characteristics, which are often defined by what they lack or signify rather than their inherent nature. It is crucial to recognize that culture is not a uniform or singular entity, but rather a complex and multifaceted aspect of human experience. Making generalizations about a culture, such as labeling an entire nation as stubborn or accommodating, oversimplifies the complexities involved. Instead, a more effective approach for a negotiator is to comprehend the nuances of a culture's values and how they impact the negotiation at hand. \n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture requires a multifaceted approach, encompassing its history, values, and even its potential biases. Rather than judging or attempting to alter a culture, it is essential to accept and work within its boundaries, particularly when in a weaker negotiating position. When negotiating in a foreign environment, respecting local traditions and customs can facilitate a smoother transition and help overcome cultural barriers. \n\nIt is worth noting that cultural boundaries do not strictly follow national or international lines. Organizational cultures within a nation can exhibit unique characteristics, such as varying work hours, communication styles, or hiring practices. For instance, some companies prioritize work-life balance, while others emphasize long working hours. By examining these differences, we can appreciate the diversity of thought within a given culture. Even within a seemingly uniform culture, there may be more to discover beneath the surface. \n\nUnderstanding core values is vital, as they provide insight into the underlying motivations and driving forces behind a culture. In cultures where saving face or maintaining harmony is highly valued, a negotiator will not publicly criticize their company or superiors to achieve a positive outcome. Conversely, in cultures that prioritize aggressive negotiations, a hard bargain is more likely. Considering these cultural nuances before entering a negotiation can greatly increase its effectiveness. However, it is also essential to establish a personal connection with the opposing party to create a more successful negotiation outcome.",
            "The phrase \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" originates from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible and serves as the starting point for St. Anselm's argument on the existence of God. Similarly, Thomas Aquinas also expresses this belief, which is why we will compare and contrast their arguments to determine whose is more convincing. To ensure a fair comparison, we will assume they both believe in the God of the Bible, as a hypothetical, non-Christian God would not be directly comparable. While both authors present valid points, neither provides a comprehensive foundation for faith in God.\n\nTo illustrate this point, let's examine St. Anselm's argument first. He emphasizes the role of introspection in understanding God, suggesting that the existence of God can be found within one's own mind. Anselm's idea is that our understanding of God is innate, and we don't need external evidence to prove it. This concept is often referred to as faith, where one accepts something as true without concrete empirical evidence. \n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas proposes that the existence of God can be logically proven through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith. This approach has practical implications for evangelism, as it allows potential converts to be persuaded by logic rather than relying on faith. Aquinas provides five distinct logical arguments to demonstrate the necessity of God's existence: the arguments of change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. These arguments demonstrate that the existence of God is a logical necessity, analogous to a missing puzzle piece that can be inferred from the rest of the puzzle without being seen directly.",
            "In the 5th or 6th century BCE, a future Buddha was born, who would later be known as the Buddha. Over the course of his life, he renounced worldly life and achieved enlightenment, leading to the establishment of Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being its most traditional form. This ancient religion, which is approximately 2500 years old, has undergone significant changes since the Buddha's time, as seen in countries like Sri Lanka, where the Theravada nation observes the water-cutting ceremony, a tradition that does not have its roots in the Buddha's teachings. These differences in traditions and core principles can be observed in both the monastic and lay communities of Theravada Buddhism, and have evolved due to a mix of internal and external factors, including both hostile and benign influences.\n\nTo facilitate this discussion, certain key terms will be used frequently. Internal forces refer to changes driven by Buddhist members, regardless of their monastic status, whereas external forces originate from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces aim to harm the Buddhist community, often fueled by a negative perception of the religion, whereas benign forces do not intend to harm or help, but may inadvertently do so. These terms will be used repeatedly in this discussion.\n\nTo begin, it's essential to understand the foundational principles of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the Triple Gem, consisting of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is comprised of the Tripitaka, which includes three collections of texts: the Sutta Pitaka (containing the Suttas), the Vinaya Pitaka (laying out disciplinary rules), and the Abhidhamma Pitaka (covering metaphysical aspects of Buddhism). Key metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these principles is crucial to ending Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, along with the cessation of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), which occur when one achieves enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for living, with five precepts for laymen (non-harming, non-deception, non-theft, non-misbehavior, and non-intoxication) and additional rules for monks. The Four Noble Truths form the central doctrine of Buddhism, stating that life is marked by suffering (Dukkha), that attachment causes suffering, and that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico represent a case study of a 57-year-long rivalry, spanning from 1836 to 1893, marked by periodic clashes and tensions between the two nations. The conflict reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, which resulted in the United States' victory and its acquisition of Texas and the American Southwest. This prolonged rivalry was fueled by fundamental differences in values, customs, and interests, as well as historical grievances, including a clash of material interests. \n\nThis scenario is not unique, as neighboring countries often experience similar rivalries due to shared border disputes and competing interests. The U.S.-Mexico relationship shares similarities with other enduring rivalries between border-sharing nations. Historian David M. Pletcher observed that the United States has faced long-standing diplomatic challenges in Mexico and Cuba, largely due to their geographical proximity and historical tensions. \n\nReligious differences were a significant factor in the U.S.-Mexico conflict, echoing a recurring theme throughout history. As Sally Frahm noted, the United States has historically been wary of Catholicism and monarchy, mirroring the ideological divisions seen in the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. This mistrust was inherited from the historical animosity between the English and Spanish, which hindered the establishment of friendly diplomatic relations between the two nations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts documented 17 disputes between the United States and Mexico during the 57-year period of rivalry. Most of these conflicts centered on territorial issues, including border raids and frontier problems, which persisted until both countries deployed military force along their borders. As historian Schmitt noted, the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States and the U.S. shifted its focus from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico during the latter part of the 19th century.",
            "It's been 15 years since an unexpected illness left me disabled, stripping away my career as a nurse and the security I had worked towards since childhood. I had become a nurse to ensure a stable future, as I had been repeatedly told, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" However, this mantra fell apart when I was 46, single, and without savings. To this day, I rely on Social Security Disability, and the little I had is now gone. Each day is a struggle, constantly threatening my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Yet, I've come to realize that my family and close friends have been my lifeline, and I couldn't have survived without them.\n\nMy experience has taught me that emergencies can strike anyone, big or small. No matter how prepared we think we are, there are some challenges we simply cannot overcome alone. In the US, it's clear that we've become too reliant on the government to solve our problems, but I believe that learning to trust and help one another would be a more effective solution.\n\nThe idea of rugged individualism, often emphasized by conservatives, is a misconception. Our ancestors didn't rely on self-reliance to survive during hard times; it was their compassion, mutual respect, and resource sharing that kept them going. The pioneers who crossed the country in wagon trains didn't achieve their goal alone.\n\nWhile it's essential to be prepared, having a disaster kit or a small farm can only take you so far. True resilience comes from building relationships with those around you, particularly your neighbors. By getting to know them, you'll create a network of support that can help you navigate life's challenges, making a difference in your ability to cope with difficulties.",
            "The mechanisms behind the evolutionary process and the constraints that influence the direction of change are still not fully understood. Although D'Arcy Thompson proposed the idea of using mathematical language to describe organic forms as early as 1917, this concept remains a subject of ongoing study. Recent applications of mathematical modeling have focused on the development and evolution of mollusk skeletons, especially in terms of ontogeny and phylogeny. Our research aims to explore how mathematical modeling in combination with experimental studies can help us understand the underlying mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental changes in the genus Prunum. To achieve this, we have analyzed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that can be used to model and predict hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell, allowing us to create hypothetical shell morphologies that can be used to determine the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. Our findings will be integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to provide a deeper understanding of macroevolutionary events within this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a spiral structure that moves through 360 degrees of space over time. The individual turns or coils of the shell are referred to as whorls, which are thought to rotate around a central axis, known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls grow can vary, and a continuous line divides each whorl, called a suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the last one, known as the body whorl. The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last, while the apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal exits its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nFrom different perspectives, shells can be viewed in apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. The standard orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count the whorls of a shell, one should first view it from the apical perspective and determine the starting point of the first suture. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell, and whorls can be counted from this line, estimating each whorl to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal builds its shell. By tracking the path of the aperture using the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture, it is possible to graphically and mathematically represent this trajectory. Once a mathematical formulation is established, it is then possible to manipulate parameters and modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia has seen little progress in reducing neonatal and infant mortality rates. Although the country is on track to meet several Millennium Development Goals, such as improving access to water and sanitation, its child and maternal health targets are far from being met. To address these shortcomings, a closer examination of the healthcare system is necessary rather than focusing solely on program-specific interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made some progress in increasing the number of births attended by skilled healthcare professionals, with 72% of births now meeting this target. However, this figure includes traditional practitioners, such as midwives, who may not be equipped to handle complications during pregnancy, which contributes to a significant number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. This improvement may be misleading, highlighting the need for further action. Furthermore, there has been a decline in the percentage of children under five years old treated by a healthcare professional for diarrheal cases, and postnatal care data remains incomplete, revealing concerns across the country.\n\nThe cesarean-section rate remains lower than expected at around 4%, and this rate also underscores another pressing issue. The rate of cesarean-sections varies significantly between urban and rural areas, standing at 7% and 2% respectively, indicating a disparity in healthcare access across the country. Moreover, the gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles is substantial, with a 27% difference, suggesting that the poor face significant barriers in accessing healthcare due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nConsidering the next steps for improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the key question revolves around how to effectively address the lack of healthcare services. The question is whether Indonesia should prioritize strengthening its overall health system or adopt program-specific approaches without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children. While programmatic approaches may be appealing due to their targeted objectives and faster results, they also have drawbacks. Investing heavily in one area may divert resources from other areas and create a surge in human resources towards the more funded sector, as seen in the case of HIV/AIDS and family planning. Moreover, running multiple parallel programs can lead to duplication and disorganization of services, increasing administrative burdens and paperwork.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous depiction of the aristocracy during that time period.  Two novels that diverge from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both works employ an element of mystery and an unconventional tone, which helps to enrich the characters within each story, offering deeper insights into their motivations and emotions.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, for instance, the protagonist's inner turmoil is often revealed through dream sequences or trance-like states. These unusual events provide a glimpse into Oliver's inner world, revealing the pain and unease he experiences due to his surroundings. When Oliver relives the shooting scene in chapter 28, it's as if he's reliving it in a dream, symbolizing his loss of control over the events that unfolded. The passage emphasizes Oliver's vulnerability, as his senses are dulled and he's unable to notice the force that's transporting him away from the scene. This event reinforces the notion that Oliver's fate is not entirely in his hands, and that he's subjected to forces beyond his control. This sense of powerlessness is further highlighted by Oliver's inability to take action to change his circumstances, even when his life is at risk. It's implied that his experiences have led to a growing sense of defeat, as if he's been broken by the hardships he's faced, leaving him without the will to resist or take control.\n\nIn a similar vein, Wuthering Heights features a dreamlike narrative that blurs the lines between reality and fantasy. The passage from Wuthering Heights describes a scene where the protagonist is overwhelmed by a cacophony of sounds and visuals, leaving him disoriented and struggling to make sense of his surroundings. The experience is characterized by an undefined sense of pain and unease, which persists and torments him relentlessly. This dreamlike state is a recurring theme in both novels, used to explore the characters' inner worlds and emotional struggles.\n\nThe use of dream sequences in these novels serves to highlight the characters' lack of agency and their vulnerability to external forces. By blurring the lines between reality and fantasy, the authors create a sense of uncertainty and ambiguity, leaving the reader questioning the nature of reality and the characters' place within it. This narrative technique also allows the authors to delve deeper into the characters' emotions and motivations, providing a more nuanced understanding of their experiences and the world they inhabit.",
            "It has been a few years since I worked in an after-school program where I tutored elementary school students. I made it my goal to assist them in any subject they struggled with, but my strengths were in English and reading. I was approached by an instructor to work with a boy named Adrian, who was having trouble reading. At first, I noticed something peculiar - he could pronounce certain letters flawlessly, but struggled with others. It wasn't until I met Adrian's mother that I realized the source of the issue: he knew the English alphabet, but not its pronunciation. This experience has stuck with me and serves as a reminder of the language barrier in schools, particularly in California. It highlights that even children who speak perfect English can face significant challenges with reading.\n\nI share this story to emphasize the issue of language barriers in schools and to demonstrate that it's not always as apparent as we think. Even children who speak English fluently can struggle with reading. This problem is a common challenge that everyone agrees exists. In Adrian's case, his issue was relatively simple to address: additional tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children who barely speak English, the solution is far more complex. There is no single answer, but rather a combination of approaches. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, or other methods alone will not solve this problem. Instead, the key lies in implementing a combination of these strategies.\n\nThe dual language system is a promising approach that can benefit not only children who speak Spanish as their first language but also all children. Research has shown that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns that this approach is resource-intensive and only benefits a small percentage of students, the evidence contradicts this claim. If implemented widely, this approach could benefit all students. To achieve this, we don't need all teachers to be bilingual, which is unrealistic and impractical. However, we can still utilize bilingual aids, tutors, or other support staff to help bridge the language gap.",
            "From a young age, many of us are taught there is something greater than ourselves, something we can't fully comprehend.  Some attend church, temple, or other faith-based institutions to learn about it, while others seek answers within themselves.  Many people accept the faith they were raised with, but some reject the idea of anything beyond their own understanding.  We may adopt a set of values as children, only to change them later as we grow and mature.  No matter which path we choose, we strive to define ourselves through our unique perspectives on spirituality.  We seek guidance and a sense of direction in life.\n\nOne afternoon, my father shared with me the bird he loved the most, the cardinal, while we sat on our front porch during a rainstorm.  As we smoked, the rain pounded against the tin roof above, and the downspouts carried the water down, drowning the plants beside us.  My father stared out into the rain, lost in thought, his eyes displaying a mix of searching and reminiscing.  He'd been struggling with his health, and his appearance had changed significantly.  We avoided eye contact, and I felt a deep sense of isolation, fear, and the inability to discuss my impending loss with him.  I sought comfort by hugging him, sitting down beside him, and gazing out into the rain alongside him.\n\nMy father passed away in December, just five days after my 22nd birthday.  The treatments had prolonged his life beyond the projected timeframe, but they only increased his suffering.  I couldn't understand the purpose of prolonging his pain.  In the silence of the night, I stopped praying, as I questioned whether a higher power had ever truly listened to me. \n\nI chose not to watch my father's final moments, unable to bear the thought of witnessing the life that shaped me come to an end.  I preferred to remember my father through the happy memories, not the sorrow of his passing.  I was convinced that he wouldn't have wanted me to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball on my bed for three days, waiting to hear the news.  Unfortunately, no one even called me to offer their condolences.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is inherently contradictory, as it combines the concepts of 'old' and 'new,' as described by Ian Watt in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been met with mixed reactions, ranging from criticism for its perceived lack of depth to praise for its ability to evoke a sense of the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The origin of the Gothic genre can be attributed to Horace Walpole's novel The Castle of Otranto, which drew inspiration from both ancient and modern romance styles to create a new form of literary expression. Walpole's work incorporated elements of medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions, blending them with the novel's modern format to create a unique storytelling experience. At the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication, the term \"Gothic\" was associated with outdated or unsophisticated concepts, as society and literature were advancing. The combination of Gothic elements and the novel's format, which allowed readers to gain a more intimate understanding of characters' psychology, contributed to the genre's enduring appeal and ability to seem both outdated and new to readers from different eras.\n\nThe concept of chivalry is a prominent theme in Gothic novels, including The Castle of Otranto. The medieval ideal of chivalry, which emphasized the qualities of a noble knight, such as bravery, honor, and competence, was retained and reinterpreted in the original Gothic novel. Chivalry held significant importance for Gothic writers like Walpole, as it represented an idealized and romanticized notion of the past, hinting at the future development of the Romantic movement. Through the use of chivalric concepts and mannerisms, the Gothic past was glorified, aiming to improve the present. Walpole, writing during a tumultuous period in history, was skeptical about the morality and goodness of his contemporaries, as seen in his portrayal of characters like Frederic. This character embodies many chivalric traits, including his status as a prince, his experience of tragedy, and his supposed heroism. The description of Frederic as a gallant and courteous knight is an exaggerated representation, which introduces the Gothic trope of excess, highlighting the genre's inclination towards over-the-top storytelling.",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the comprehensive process of moving goods from the initial customer order through various stages, including raw materials, production, supply, and distribution to the end customer. The concept of supply chain management was introduced by Keith Oliver, a consultant, in 1982. According to Keith Oliver, it involves planning, implementing, and controlling all aspects of the supply chain to meet customer needs efficiently and effectively. The supply chain comprises six critical components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information.\n\nBusiness managers utilize these six key elements to deliver exceptional customer service. Production is the foundation of the supply chain process, requiring careful planning of 'what,' 'when,' 'where,' and 'how' to produce products. Understanding customer demands is crucial for production planning, and this can be achieved by analyzing market trends, which serve as a significant indicator of customer needs. Once market analysis is complete, managers can decide on the products to produce, their quantities, and the optimal production location to meet customer expectations. This decision-making process also involves scheduling workloads, equipment maintenance, and ensuring that production aligns with customer satisfaction.\n\nEvery detail in the production process is vital, and any misstep can result in significant time and financial losses for the company in the long run. A well-structured process, as seen in companies like Wal-Mart and Target, which have established detailed guidelines for various aspects of their business, helps prevent confusion and ensures a smooth workflow. The second essential element of supply chain management is supply, which involves making strategic decisions to determine a company's core capabilities and identify potential outsourcing partnerships. This may involve dividing production into various divisions, each with specialized equipment, workers, and expertise. Outsourcing certain tasks to other companies can help achieve velocity – the ability to provide quality, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness – while maintaining low costs.",
            "The sign held by Ellen Page, star of the film Juno, bears a haunting message: 'Hitler is alive in Burma.'  The statement is a reference to the country now known as Myanmar, a Southeast Asian nation ruled by a ruthless military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, the country witnessed a wave of street protests, dubbed 'The Saffron Revolution,' as thousands of Burmese monks took to the streets, donning their distinctive orange robes. Although the government initially allowed the peaceful demonstrations, the situation quickly escalated into violence, with the military cracking down on the monks and foreign journalists, resulting in the tragic death of a Japanese photojournalist. Estimates of the death toll vary, with some sources suggesting that the true number of fatalities may be in the thousands.\n\nThis is a recurring theme throughout history, where governments have consistently sought to suppress dissent and maintain control over their citizens. From ancient Rome's autocratic rulers to modern-day leaders, the desire for absolute power has been a persistent pattern. Notable examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, where the government brutally suppressed a gathering of intellectuals, activists, and students, and the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, in which Hutu militia groups, backed by the government, systematically targeted Tutsis and moderate ethnic groups. Another infamous example is the Nazi regime's 'Third Reich,' where millions of people, particularly those of Jewish descent, were rounded up and killed. These events serve as stark reminders of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of protecting human rights and freedoms.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting impact on jazz can be attributed to his remarkable longevity and exceptional ability to shape his orchestra creatively. Although he often played subtly on the piano in many of his compositions, as a composer, Ellington excelled at crafting intricate, complex pieces that showcased the unique talents of each band member. By designing a framework that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also writing tightly orchestrated passages that highlighted the distinct styles of individual musicians, Ellington achieved a coherent and original sound for each piece. His mastery of the unique timbres of his players, combined with his understanding of how they blended together in an ensemble, enabled him to create some of the most innovative and brilliant jazz pieces in history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes Ellington's innovative approach to incorporating the voice as a jazz instrument, exemplified in his early work \"Creole Love Call.\" This piece demonstrates Ellington's ability to use the human voice to add texture and color without relying on lyrics, setting it apart from other musical forms. The song features a slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues structure with six distinct choruses. These choruses showcase Ellington's skill in combining different musical elements, including call-and-response patterns, soloists, and instrumental textures.\n\nIn \"Creole Love Call,\" the first chorus features a call-and-response exchange between the voice and reeds, which transitions from smooth to rough. The second chorus features a muted trumpet solo that expands on the melody, emphasizing extended notes. The third chorus showcases a clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle piano phrase with syncopated rhythms. The fourth chorus has the full band echoing the first chorus, with call-and-response interactions between the brass and reed sections. The fifth chorus is climactic, with the reeds initiating the call-and-response pattern in a high register, accompanied by syncopated rhythms from the brass and rhythm sections. The sixth and final chorus returns to the structure of the first, with call-and-response between the voice and reeds, this time featuring the voice using the \"growl\" technique to solo like an instrument. A brief tag concludes the piece with a vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending.\n\nEllington's use of the human voice to add tonal depth to his compositions is a recurring theme throughout his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year after \"Creole Love Call,\" Ellington combines his skill in arranging complex orchestral textures with his sensitivity to tonal color. The call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich and complementary sound by combining vocal and instrumental elements. In \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" Ellington leverages the unique talent of Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a prominent member of his orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone, further showcasing his ability to bring out the best in his musicians.",
            "She had a persistent feeling of incompleteness that began when she was 14 and had continued for three years. It wasn't until she turned 17 that she realized she was looking for a romantic connection rather than a material one. Despite her age, she found herself uninterested in any of the boys she encountered. She frequently questioned why she felt this way, but her introspection couldn't provide a clear explanation. As a result, she continued to go about her life, often pondering her desires.\n\nOn a typical day at home, her parents were known for their calm demeanor and infrequent arguments. In fact, the only disagreements they had were about her strong will and independent nature, which often clashed with their laid-back personalities. She was a lively and likable person who balanced out her parents' calmness. However, this day was different. While searching for new ideas, she was startled by a loud cry and the distress in her mother's voice coming from the kitchen. Rushing to the scene, she frantically asked, \"Mom, what's wrong?\" and found her mother lying on the ground in pain. She quickly put a hand on her mother's shoulder to offer support and asked her to clarify the situation. Her mother, struggling to speak, managed to utter, \"I need you to take me to the hospital.\" Realizing her mother was in severe pain, she offered to drive her and carefully helped her mother into the car. \n\nThe hospital's sterile atmosphere was filled with the scent of disinfectant and the air of concern. Despite the sense of unease that surrounded her, the daughter's focus was solely on her mother. She swiftly carried her into the hospital and called for medical assistance. The doctors and nurses quickly attended to her mother, and the daughter was left to anxiously wait for updates on her mother's condition. It turned out that her mother had fallen off a step stool while trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "The study aimed to assess the relationship between adherence to a Mediterranean Diet, as reflected in an \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" and the risk of chronic heart disease and stroke. This diet is characterized by high consumption of plant-based foods, such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, as well as monounsaturated fats and fish, and lower intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is also allowed.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that adhering to the Mediterranean Diet is associated with a lower risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, and an intervention trial found it to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving cholesterol levels in obese individuals. However, research on the specific link between the Mediterranean Diet and stroke mortality has been limited.\n\nThe study in question followed a cohort of 74,886 women aged 38-63 without a history of heart disease or diabetes, who were part of the Nurses' Health Study. Over a 20-year period from 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score six times, using self-reported food frequency questionnaires that assessed nutrient intake over the past year. The questionnaires were validated through multiple studies, and reports of heart disease, stroke, and other health outcomes were confirmed through medical records and other official documents. When records were not available, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included in the analysis, representing about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal heart attacks.\n\nThe analysis controlled for various factors that could influence the results, such as body mass index, smoking status, physical activity, and medication use. To minimize individual variability and accurately represent long-term dietary habits, the researchers averaged the aMed scores from repeated questionnaires. The study used Cox proportional-hazard modeling to assess the relationship between the aMed score and the risk of heart disease and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal outcomes.\n\nThe results showed that a higher aMed diet score was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths were recorded. Women with the highest aMed diet scores were found to be at lower risk for both heart disease and stroke compared to those with the lowest scores, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The United States experienced a severe financial crisis in 2007, marked by a rise in unemployment, a collapse of the housing market, and the downfall of several major corporations. This ongoing economic downturn has raised important questions about the causes of the crisis and how to prevent similar events in the future. The crisis was primarily triggered by ill-conceived and shortsighted policies that pushed banks and financial institutions to issue sub-prime loans within a fragile and underdeveloped financial framework. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were under pressure to purchase and package these high-risk mortgages into complex securities, which ultimately led to a chain reaction of financial instability when borrowers defaulted on their loans. As a result, the banks found themselves with insufficient capital reserves and were forced to transfer the chaos to the securities they had sold and the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the crisis can be traced back to the Clinton administration's policies in the late 1990s, when it relaxed lending restrictions in an attempt to boost President Clinton's popularity. This move inadvertently set the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. As reported by Steven Holmes of the New York Times in 1999, Fannie Mae was under pressure from the government to increase mortgage lending to low- and moderate-income individuals, while also meeting the expectations of its shareholders for continued growth. Holmes correctly predicted the potential consequences of these actions, warning that the government-subsidized corporation might face financial difficulties in a downturn, requiring a government bailout similar to the one for the savings and loan industry in the 1980s. Unfortunately, the warnings went unheeded, and the economy eventually suffered a devastating collapse.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the proliferation of complex mortgage instruments such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These innovations created a web of interconnectedness between the housing market and other sectors of the economy, leaving households and financial markets vulnerable to even slight changes in the housing market. The result was a housing bubble that eventually burst, causing widespread financial instability. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for approximately 30% of the country's GDP. The crisis ultimately led to the collapse of several major financial institutions, including Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers, while others, such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, were forced to undergo significant regulatory changes. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in 2008.",
            "Ah, the infamous exposition - that part of your story where you spread your creative wings, only to risk losing your readers' interest with an overabundance of background information. Or, worse still, you might inadvertently put them to sleep or prompt them to hit the back button in frustration. Dr. Merlin has been known to lash out at her screen when she finds herself bogged down in unnecessary details, and it's far from an enjoyable experience.\n\nExposition is not a trusted ally in the world of writing. Many readers are already familiar with the fundamental tip \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself slipping into lengthy passages that fail to propel the plot forward. It's a common pitfall that can be avoided by recognizing the temptation to present a character's backstory or history at the expense of engaging storytelling.\n\nExposition is essentially the act of telling the audience about events, typically in a straightforward manner. In film, this can be seen when one character shares an excessive amount of information with another, much like the infamous \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, the author is responsible for embedding exposition into the narrative.\n\nLet's consider an example. Imagine reading a story where the heroine's past is summarized in a few sentences: \"She met her beloved at a certain place and time, got married in a grand ceremony, and witnessed her husband's tragic demise.\" You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to span multiple pages, with the characters having barely a few lines of conversation. Instead, you would expect the author to delve deeper into the husband's character by showing his love through his words and actions, and to explore the heroine's transformation through the impact of her husband's presence in her life. This would enable you to develop an emotional connection with the characters and gain insight into their thoughts, beliefs, and dreams.\n\nIn essence, you would expect more substance to be added to the basic storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\" As a writer, it's your responsibility to provide this depth and richness. While it can be tempting to rush through certain details, it's essential to resist the urge to oversimplify your characters' backgrounds and personalities. For instance, when introducing a new character, you might be tempted to reveal their entire history, from their time in the Air Force to their current role as a night manager at a gas station, including their past marriages and weekend fishing trips. However, it's crucial to avoid overwhelming the reader with too much information and instead opt for a more nuanced and engaging approach.",
            "I watched the morning news from NBC 4 in Columbus, Ohio on August 13, 2011. The live broadcast featured a story about a man from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. Although the wife's name was not mentioned, the husband, Shad Hostettler, was identified, and his mugshot was shown, which appeared to be quite disturbing. The news team devoted approximately two minutes to this developing story, which was sufficient given the circumstances. \n\nAnother story covered a shooting in the Sharon Woods area, where an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers was shot and critically injured. At that time, there were no arrests or suspects, and the SWAT team was investigating. I felt that this story was brief, and I suspect it might have been due to the fact that the victim was a minority and the incident occurred in a predominantly black neighborhood. This observation is consistent with my long-held perception that the media often glosses over crimes committed against minorities. \n\nFollowing that, the news reported on a gunshot wound discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. The authorities believed they knew where the incident occurred and mentioned that the damage was caused by a .22 caliber rifle bullet. A $5,000 reward was being offered for any information that could lead to the capture of the perpetrator. \n\nThe next story was about a forecast for thunderstorms and rain on Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to remain in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. The news team kept this segment brief, using it as a teaser to encourage viewers to stay tuned. \n\nAdditionally, the news covered a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus, which was committed by a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. He was described as being about six feet tall and 150 pounds. I found it unusual that the news emphasized the perpetrator's black skin tone and darkness.\n\nFinally, the broadcast featured a story about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas-based marijuana kingpin who had been found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. It was interesting to note that the news anchor chose to describe his sentence as 300 months rather than 25 years. I am uncertain whether this was an attempt to make the sentence sound more severe or not. The news also highlighted Rodriguez's Hispanic background, which seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "A profound connection exists between brothers, transcending words and emotions. This unbreakable bond encompasses a multitude of feelings - love, pride, envy, and even cruelty - making it difficult to fully comprehend. Brothers possess an uncanny understanding of one another, often seeing in each other a reflection of themselves. It is in the face of extreme adversity that the true nature of this bond reveals itself, whether it be positive or negative. The consequences of these emotions can be severe. To grasp the depth of the emotions tied to this fraternal link, one must accept the repercussions that accompany them. When a brother looks into the eyes of another and sees their own reflection, they gain insight into themselves, not as others perceive them, but as they genuinely are. Their true character is ultimately reflected in their actions and the outcomes of those actions. This theme is explored in James Hurst's \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" a tale of two brothers navigating the complex emotions that come with their relationship. Against the backdrop of a vividly described landscape, these brothers embark on a doomed journey. As their story unfolds, bitter disappointment collides with intense pride in a climactic confrontation, resulting in the survival of only one brother. Through the protagonist, the narrator, and their interactions, the narrative conveys the intricate emotions and worldviews that influence the protagonist's actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single dominant emotion: pride. From the outset, he feels resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle, as the latter's fragile health makes it impossible for him to participate in the activities the protagonist had envisioned for them. The protagonist's dreams of a brother to share experiences with, like exploring the outdoors, are shattered by Doodle's condition. This realization sparks a mix of anger and disappointment within the protagonist, who even contemplates infanticide in a moment of desperation. However, a fleeting glimpse of his brother's smile gives him hope, revealing a deeper love for Doodle that exists beneath his surface-level emotions. This juxtaposition of feelings highlights the complexity of the protagonist's character and the turmoil he experiences as he grapples with the reality of his brother's limitations.",
            "The brain is an intricate and dynamic mechanism for processing information. As technology evolved, the comparisons used to describe it have also become more sophisticated. Initially, the brain was likened to a wax tablet, followed by a sheet of papyrus, a book, and finally a computer. However, it's essential to remember that these comparisons have their limitations and can lead to inaccurate conclusions. \n\nThe process of processing information in the brain begins with the reception of data from sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, temperature, sound waves, and light into electrical signals. The sensory information is then continuously processed through the brain's algorithms, both from the bottom up and from the top down. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing integrates basic information such as color, orientation, and border definition to conclude that it's seeing a box. Meanwhile, top-down processing utilizes the decisions made at earlier stages to facilitate faster object recognition, such as identifying the object as a black box rather than a hole in the background.\n\nOnce information reaches a certain level of processing, an attention filter determines its significance and decides which cognitive processes it should be made accessible to. An example is when your brain processes every blade of grass when looking down at your shoes, but a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing each individual blade. Conversely, you'll more likely notice your name even in a noisy environment. There are various stages of processing, and attention modulates the results repeatedly.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it first needs to store it. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information must be encoded, with different encoding methods applicable to each type of sensory stimulus. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on its visual appearance, sound, or meaning. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Research on animals suggests that working memory, which retains information for approximately 20 seconds, is sustained through an electrical signal that loops through a particular sequence of neurons for a short duration. On the other hand, long-term memory is hypothesized to be sustained through the structure of specific types of proteins.\n\nThere are numerous theories on how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on how humans retrieve memories, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that there are nodes representing concepts, and the nodes are connected based on their relatedness. For instance, in the semantic network, the concept \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the impending threats posed by technology and the capitalist framework that sustains it in his dystopian novel, Brave New World. The society depicted values collective harmony above individuality, conditioning its citizens from the outset to prioritize immediate gratification above all else. The inhabitants are portrayed as pawns in a larger game, bound by a single ideology dictated by the World Controller. When examined through the lens of Marxist ideology, Huxley's work reveals his underlying skepticism towards the emergence of these systems. The novel's use of Marxist terminology, such as homogeny and reification, reinforces the notion that it is a commentary on the flaws in the economic systems of Huxley's time.\n\nThe novel satirizes capitalism by employing the Marxist concept of false consciousness. It suggests that the common people are prevented from understanding their true relationships with other social classes due to their primary focus on personal gain. This is exemplified by the conditioning of the population through hypnopædia, which reinforces the drive to consume, spend, and indulge. The World Controller manipulates the population in this manner, as seen in the actions of the lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, who have no genuine autonomy. Their will is instead shaped by the desires instilled in them, making them complicit in their own oppression.\n\nThe concept of hegemony, where a dominant group exercises control over other social classes, is also evident in Brave New World. The lower classes are unaware of their manipulation, literally buying into an ideology that perpetuates the existing power structure. The upper classes, comprising Alphas and Betas, are either unaware or unresponsive to the manipulation, with few exceptions like Bernard, who merely accepts his position. The novel's portrayal of the social classes' interactions is a significant indication of the perceived effects of capitalist oppression.\n\nThe relationships between individuals in Brave New World are superficial, lacking depth and emotional complexity. Huxley may be suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together erode human free will and expression. Love and intense emotions are absent, replaced by shallow interactions focused on physical appearance, as seen in the characters' comments about women and their encounters. The complacency of each social class with their position in the hierarchy and their absolute obedience to their role in the community reflect the Marxist notion of the proletariat, who are misled into believing their superiority is guaranteed as long as they conform to societal expectations.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for about two and a half years, which equates to four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, navigating the campus can be a significant challenge. In my first year, I lived in East Halls, which is one of the farthest residential areas from the main campus, excluding the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. Moving from my home in Stuart Hall to classrooms in buildings such as the Willard building, located near the center of campus, often took around 25 minutes on foot, especially during adverse weather conditions, which are common in State College. During a conversation with an alumnus not much older than me, I discovered that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the university by large stretches of unused land. However, this vacant space has since been transformed into sports fields, new buildings, and surrounding apartments. As the campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another is becoming increasingly difficult. The most effective solution to this mobility issue on a college campus is undoubtedly the bicycle. However, simply having a bike is not enough; students need to use it regularly, and the campus infrastructure should be designed with cyclists' needs in mind.\n\nTalking to a friend who had recently recommenced biking after a several-year break, I found out that he was wondering why he had stopped. He said, \"Bikes are great,\" and that for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it is the only efficient way to get around.\" In addition to being beneficial for one's health, bicycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical exertion can take you 30 miles or more. As an off-campus resident, I live as far from the campus center as some dorms. This year, I made the smart decision to purchase a bike. With classes in Thomas building, which takes around 25 minutes to walk from my home, riding a bike can significantly cut down the travel time to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly enough. However, my route to Thomas building, Pollock Road, is not the most convenient or safe option for biking. There are also advantages to walking, but personally, I am too busy to walk. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable means of getting to class, which would require an extra 30-40 minutes from my daily schedule, translating to over two and a half hours per week. Adding this to the additional time spent walking to and from other classes, appointments, and other commitments would leave me with no time to spare."
