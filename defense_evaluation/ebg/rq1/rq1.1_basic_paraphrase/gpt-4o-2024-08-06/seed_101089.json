            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture has a crucial impact on negotiations. It can be defined just as much by what it's not as by what it is and what it represents. Culture isn't uniform, nor is it a single entity. Broad statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are inherently simplistic and generalize too much. While understanding cultural generalizations can be useful, it's more beneficial for a negotiator to grasp how a culture's attitudes might influence the negotiation process. When encountering a foreign culture, one tends to relate it to their own, leading to inevitable comparisons.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset can range from studying its history to recognizing its biases. Instead of judging or trying to alter a culture, one should accept it as it is and work within its parameters, especially in negotiations, and particularly if one is negotiating from a weaker position. Similarly, if negotiating on foreign soil, respecting traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and advance the negotiation.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that culture isn't limited to national or international distinctions. Companies within a nation often have their own corporate cultures. For example, a corporate culture might prioritize long office hours or a more flexible schedule. Corporate culture can be observed in employee dress codes, communication styles (direct vs. indirect), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at all levels, while others limit it to company-approved initiatives. The differences in American corporate culture from one company to another (and even within companies across different regions and between urban and suburban areas) illustrate the diversity of thought within a societal culture. While some cultures may seem less stratified and more uniform, this similarity is often just a surface-level observation, prompting a deeper examination.\n\nUnderstanding values is even more crucial, as they explain the reasons behind a culture's behavior. If maintaining face or communal harmony is valued, a negotiator will avoid publicly embarrassing their company or superior to succeed. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that values hard bargaining won't rush to settle quickly. Considering these generalities is important before entering negotiations. However, it's beneficial for a negotiator to learn about their counterpart on a personal level to ensure effective negotiations.",
            "The statement \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God’” originates from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible and serves as the foundation for St. Anselm’s argument about God’s existence. Thomas Aquinas, another thinker we will examine, appears to share this belief. As both philosophers defend the same concept, our task is to evaluate whose argument is superior. For the sake of brevity, we will assume both are correct in their belief in the God of the Bible. Considering a different kind of God would not allow us to fairly compare their arguments, as both focus on the same specific notion of God. However, I propose that while each philosopher presents compelling points, neither offers a comprehensive foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo explore this, we will first look at St. Anselm’s basic argument. Anselm suggests that understanding through faith reveals God within oneself. He argues that because God exists in our understanding, we cannot truly imagine God’s nonexistence. Although his explanation can seem tedious and unclear, the essence is that the evidence for God is found in one’s own mind. St. Anselm advises us that truth about God resides within us, and we find it by examining what we inherently know to be true. External evidence is deemed unnecessary. This acceptance of beliefs without undeniable empirical evidence is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas proposes that God’s existence can be demonstrated solely through reason and empirical evidence, without requiring faith. This approach could aid in evangelism, a key element of Christianity, by converting new believers through logic rather than relying on their acceptance of unproven beliefs. St. Thomas outlines five logical arguments for God’s existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument shows that the need for God is logically necessary. Just as a missing puzzle piece can be identified by examining the assembled puzzle, logic allows us to infer the characteristics and existence of God without direct evidence.",
            "Authors often employ various methods to evoke specific emotions or perspectives in their readers regarding significant topics. Some of these methods prove more effective than others. In his novel, The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes numerous such techniques. Occasionally, Fitzgerald combines adjectives and nouns in unconventional ways to create a particular atmosphere around a subject. At other times, he assigns symbolic meanings to objects and uses them to achieve a similar effect. He notably applies this technique to colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald imbues colors like white/gray and red/pink with meaning, later using them to evoke specific emotions around significant objects.\n\nFitzgerald assigns a sense of uniformity to white/gray, with white symbolizing a slightly more refined and upper-class status, while gray denotes something older and more faded. He establishes this symbolism early in the novel, frequently referencing both colors. Daisy and Jordan are often depicted \"in white\" (8), and indeed, everyone seems to wear white: Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom is seen in a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only instance where white is absent is during Nick's observations of Gatsby's party: the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further solidifies the meanings of these colors by associating them with mundane, insignificant subjects: as Nick commutes to work, he travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names of Gatsby's party guests are \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's list, and Catherine's apartment is part of \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—denoting uniformity (28). He also uses white or gray to describe ordinary people or places: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) appear in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" on the train is \"gray\" (26), and the dog seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nAfter establishing these meanings for white/gray, Fitzgerald uses them to indicate insignificance or uniformity in certain contexts. This use of color symbolism begins with Daisy. After a period without notable references to these colors, Fitzgerald depicts Daisy \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" prompting readers to view Daisy as less of an individual character and more as a uniform entity, something that Gatsby yearns for (74). Fitzgerald continues using this technique with Daisy to reinforce the impression of her as a uniform element, such as mentioning the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18) and her \"white\" dress (115) before the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County boasts significant agricultural productivity due to its mild, sunny climate. The region's typical crops include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a strong demand for organic, community-supported agriculture (CSA) food in the area, with many local organizations having long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also favored. Numerous organic farms offer tours of their operations and provide opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. Such operations enable landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitats, thus facilitating recreational use and creating opportunities for farm tours and educational or profit-generating programs.\n\nWhile organic farming can tap into a potentially profitable niche market, it also offers benefits like increased biodiversity in plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemicals in soil and water. However, organic farming can be more costly than conventional farming, as it demands more labor and management to control pests, weeds, and soil fertility without chemicals. Organic farms often face higher losses compared to conventional ones, and small organic farms lack the efficiency of scale seen in larger operations. Moreover, practices that benefit wildlife, although not directly related to organic farming, may incur higher labor costs, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing, removing invasive species, and managing plant growth to create specific habitats. Therefore, there are several reasons a landowner might seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land selected for this scenario is a 160-acre parcel near Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It consists of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest, situated in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of San Diego's Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This plan, which is still under review, considers over a hundred plant and animal species, including endangered ones like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, as well as declining species like burrowing owls.\n\nHistorically, this area was inhabited by Native Americans for many centuries, and later, in the late 1800s, it was settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers. This land was once part of an original homestead patent and likely used for grazing and wood production over the decades.\n\nI chose a piece of property from a real estate website and investigated available government programs to explore options for a small farmer to reduce costs and maintain wildlife-friendly practices. As an example of what someone farming this land might aim to achieve, I identified an organic farm in the same vicinity.",
            "There exists a unique connection between brothers—an unbreakable and enduring bond. This connection encompasses a spectrum of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers have a profound understanding of each other, unmatched by any other relationship, and often see a reflection of themselves in one another. In moments of crisis, the true essence of this bond becomes evident, whether positive or negative. When these emotions surface, they come with significant consequences. Understanding the emotions that arise from this fraternal bond involves facing the repercussions they entail. Seeing oneself in a brother's eyes reveals one's true self, not as others perceive, but as they truly are. The real character is revealed through actions and their outcomes. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is explored by two brothers, alongside the intense emotions that accompany it. Against a backdrop of a rich and vividly depicted setting, these boys embark on a futile quest. The story reaches its climax as bitter disappointment clashes with immense pride, leaving only one brother alive. The theme is conveyed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, their interactions, and the narrator's perspective, which reveals the protagonist's complex feelings and worldview, both of which heavily influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single dominant emotion: pride. From the moment he and his younger brother, Doodle, venture out together to their final, ill-fated journey, he harbors resentment toward Doodle. He desired a brother with whom he could share his worldly skills, such as \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He longed for a companion to \"race to Horsehead Landing...and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn...\" These aspirations were unattainable due to Doodle's condition. Doodle was born with a severely weak heart, making his survival unlikely and vigorous physical activity nearly impossible. This realization was a harsh blow to the protagonist, whose dreams were dashed. At one point, he even harbored anger towards the fragile child, contemplating suffocating him with a pillow. What child would consider such an act? However, his heart softened when the small child smiled at him, an act that gave the protagonist hope. This indicates that his resolve was likely not strong, as he had an inherent love for his brother deep down.",
            "The human brain is a complex and inventive system for processing information. As technology has evolved from simple to advanced, so too have the metaphors for describing the brain. It was initially likened to a wax tablet, then a papyrus sheet, later a book, and now a computer. When learning about the brain, it's important to remember that these metaphors have limitations and can lead to misunderstandings.  \nInformation processing begins with sensory input, where physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound, or light rays are converted into electrochemical signals by sensory organs. The brain's algorithms continually transform this sensory information through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines basic details like color, orientation, and object borders—where color shifts abruptly—to determine that a box is present. Top-down processing then uses decisions from the bottom-up process to expedite the recognition of the box, such as identifying it as a black box instead of a box-like hole in the white.  \nAfter some degree of processing, an attention filter assesses the signal's significance and determines which cognitive processes should access it. For example, your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, but a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing each one individually. Conversely, you might notice your name being spoken even in a loud room. Processing occurs in multiple stages, with attention continuously modulating the results.  \nFor the brain to process information, it must first store it. Memory comes in various forms, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, with specific encoding types for different sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input might be encoded structurally (appearance of the word), phonemically (sound of the word), or semantically (meaning of the word). Once stored, information needs to be maintained. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which retains information for about 20 seconds, is maintained by electrical signals looping through specific neurons briefly. Long-term memory is thought to be preserved in the structure of certain proteins.  \nThere are many models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on human memory retrieval, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented as nodes, connected based on their relationships. For instance, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which could then link to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a devastating financial crisis. Unemployment rose, the housing market collapsed, and numerous major corporations were left in disarray. This recession continues today, prompting us to question: what caused this crisis, and how can it be prevented? Essentially, the crisis was triggered by shortsighted and selfish political decisions that coerced banks and firms into granting sub-prime loans within an already fragile financial system. At the same time, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were urged to underwrite and bundle these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves and the turmoil spread to the repackaged mortgages they had sold, and eventually, to the larger economy.\n\nThe origins of the financial crisis trace back to 1999 during the Clinton administration, as the President sought to secure a second term by boosting his popularity. The Clinton administration achieved this by easing lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under growing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income individuals and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its impressive profit growth.\" Holmes accurately predicted the outcome: \"But the government-backed corporation may face difficulties in an economic downturn, leading to a government bailout similar to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.\" As discussed earlier, and as Holmes predicted, such reckless lending inevitably led to economic collapse.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic downturn, one being the new, intricate mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were heavily utilized leading up to the crisis, further entangling various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This caused U.S. households and financial markets to overextend themselves in the housing sector, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that invested in these mortgage-backed securities suffered. The five leading U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, amounting to about 30% of the USA's GDP. Ultimately, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at very low prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to become commercial banks subject to stringent regulations. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac held $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That part of your story where you spread your creative wings and captivate everyone with your engaging, even enchanting, writing. Or, alternatively, the part where your readers might doze off or click away, muttering your name in frustration. Dr. Merlin has been known to yell at her screen when she finds herself amid an overload of information, and not in an entertaining way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy kind readers are already familiar with the basic writing advice, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still encounters lengthy text where nothing happens, or too much does. Exposition is like the mischievous imp on your shoulder urging you to lay out the backstory to get to the exciting parts (distinct from the other imp encouraging you to detail every character's childhood).\n\nExposition involves telling the audience what occurred, usually in straightforward prose. In movies, it happens when a character provides a data dump, reminiscent of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing this telling.\n\nLet's consider an example. As you're reading a story, you're informed that the heroine met her beloved at a specific time and place, they had a grand wedding, and her husband was killed before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this whole sequence to span two pages, with each getting only two lines of dialogue. You'd anticipate the author to delve into the husband's character, showing through his words and actions how much he loves his wife, and similarly, you'd expect the heroine to demonstrate, in various ways, how his presence transformed and enriched her life (especially if the story later states this directly). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally invested in his fate and provide insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, the depth of their connection, hints about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams reflected through his perspective, and so on. You would grieve his death with her, thereby deepening your connection to the heroine.\n\nIn essence, you'd expect substance on the simple framework of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that substance. (*looks at the metaphor, sighs, continues anyway*) Sometimes, it's tempting to gloss over certain details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character, and you know he was in the Air Force, now works as a night manager at a gas station, was married twice with no kids, enjoys weekend fishing, secretly dreams of owning the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first was NBC 4's live broadcast this morning (August 13, 2011). The main story involved a man from Ashley, Ohio, named Shad Hostettler, who had stabbed his wife. Although they didn't mention her name, they did show his mugshot and described him as looking menacing. The story was brief, lasting about two minutes, as it was still unfolding. The details given were that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I felt they allocated an appropriate amount of time to this report.\n\nThe second story covered an early morning shooting of an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area, leaving him critically injured. There were no arrests or suspects at the time, and the SWAT Team was investigating. This story was also short, possibly because it involved a \"black\" man or took place in a black neighborhood. I've noticed over the years that crimes involving minorities are often overlooked. If a \"white\" child or adult is kidnapped or becomes a crime victim, the media gives extensive coverage, but minority cases might not even be mentioned.\n\nAnother report was about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They shared details on where the incident likely occurred and identified the bullet as a .22 caliber from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThe next segment was about the predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to remain in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. The weather coverage was brief, likely intended as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nThey also covered a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie, about six feet tall and weighing around 150 pounds. I felt they spent an excessive amount of time emphasizing his skin color and how dark he was.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He was found guilty of conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, they stated his sentence as \"300 months\" instead of 25 years, possibly to make it sound harsher. They also mentioned his Hispanic ethnicity, which I didn't think was relevant to the story.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of security that aims to replicate the performance of an index, commodity, or collection of assets, similar to an index fund. However, it is more adaptable, as it can be traded like a stock on an exchange. An ETF offers the diversification advantages of an index fund along with the perks of single stock ownership, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase even just one share per transaction. These appealing benefits come with the added advantage of lower expense ratios compared to the typical mutual fund. Nonetheless, there are drawbacks, such as the need to pay a commission for ETF trades, just as you would for stock trades. Another advantage of ETFs is the wide range of funds available. Despite these stated benefits, it's wise for a prudent investor to assess whether these benefits, like diversification, genuinely exist and to what degree. In this analysis, we will focus on the ETF IHF, comparing it to its top 10 holdings to see if the advantages of owning a single ETF match those of holding a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, or if there are better configurations of the same stocks that offer a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo evaluate the ETF, we will focus on just the top ten holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets, as including every holding would be cumbersome. Below are the top 10 holdings and their percentage of total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use their current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate each stock's contribution to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consists entirely of these ten stocks in the proportions set by the ETF's holdings. The Beta and return calculations are shown in the chart below.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings has a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta for the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the entire ETF. These findings suggest that a portfolio limited to the top 10 holdings could yield a higher return with a lower beta. However, it's possible that the means of these two portfolios might not be statistically different.\n\nTo determine if these portfolios are statistically different, we calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalize them to 100%, and compare their cumulative standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, there was a steep decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project, which was somewhat discouraging, and it's unclear why this occurred. The arrival of winter at a New England campus likely led to fewer people commuting by bicycle or on foot, contributing to the decline. Additionally, December is the end of the fall semester, when people are busy completing schoolwork and grading, possibly causing the commuter log to be overlooked. Moreover, December marks the start of the hectic holiday season and a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many are not required to visit the campus. Classes resume in late January for the spring semester, which may also explain the low number of logs for that month. However, this doesn't fully account for the low submissions in February. It's possible that any project like this experiences initial enthusiasm that wanes over time. To counteract this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign that successfully increased log submissions that month. Thus, a key challenge was maintaining project momentum despite a natural decline in engagement and the specific issues of holiday and semester breaks in higher education. Another challenge for this project, or any alternative commuting project, is that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars, which is deeply rooted in our culture. Therefore, providing incentives for alternative commuting is crucial. We offered many prizes, such as gift certificates to local eateries, coffee shops, massage therapists, an independent bookstore, and some larger national chains. It would have been interesting to see how offering larger prizes, like a bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car, might have influenced participation and helped address the dip in engagement. The prizes remained the same throughout the project, but increasing their value over time might have been beneficial. While the gift cards were sufficient at the project's start, announcing the addition of a few bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January might have boosted participation and engagement instead of seeing a decrease.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress’s collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films typically utilize creative editing to create illusions. My analysis primarily focused on detailing the stylistic elements prevalent in most trick films and identifying unique features in some later films. Generally, trick films from this period are confined to a set, shot within a frontal proscenium without any camera movement, relying on long and medium shots, and following a strict one shot = one film approach. However, a few films from the early 1900s deviate from these norms by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA key characteristic shared by these trick films is their filming on an interior set within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remains stationary, not following any figures or objects. This composition was typical in early films, influenced by theater and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. Due to this stage-like setup, movement in trick films is mostly lateral, with figures rarely moving towards or away from the camera. For instance, in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), actors enter from the right and move horizontally, but the camera does not track them when they exit the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also means that shots are predominantly long shots, with medium shots being less common, and close-ups never used in any Edison trick films. This mirrors the theater and vaudeville tradition, where the audience views the entire performance within the stage’s borders. Like many early films, actors remain in the middle ground, and close-ups are absent.\n\nTypically, early trick films adhere to the concept that one conceptual shot constitutes a film, limiting their duration to around a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. This also restricts the dramatic or narrative potential of trick films, which mostly showcase short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts, with minimal storytelling. However, in trick films, a single conceptual shot for the viewer might actually be a composite of several shots creating the illusion of appearance or disappearance. For instance, in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), a closer look reveals the point where the shot with Mary’s \"severed head\" starts, despite the entire film being perceived as one continuous shot by the viewer.",
            "Ian Watt characterizes the traditional \"Gothic Novel\" as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" in his work, The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic style has been both criticized and praised, accused of lacking depth yet admired for its 'terrible sublime' quality, as Burke notes. The first \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, blended elements from both \"ancient and modern\" romances to establish the proto-Gothic genre, offering a new literary expression. Walpole combines \"old\" theatrical elements with 'new' imitations of nature found in 'modern' novels to craft what he calls \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). This genre draws heavily from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even during the time The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" was applied to various peoples, styles, and eras, often seen as outdated or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" societal and literary \"progress.\" The merger of theatrical \"Gothic\" elements with the novel's new format, which provided a more personal insight into character psychology, contributed to the Gothic's enduring appeal, making it simultaneously obsolete and fresh to readers far removed from its original creation.\n\nA key Gothic concept in these novels is Chivalry. The medieval notion of chivalry, the training of a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is significant to Gothic authors because it symbolizes the ideal knight—brave, honorable, competent—and reflects the perceived absence of such ideals in society, a concern of writers like Walpole. By incorporating chivalric themes and manners, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized (foreshadowing the Gothic's evolution into Romanticism) to attempt to better the present. When writing The Castle of Otranto, Walpole was experiencing political turmoil and was disillusioned about the future. Engulfed in politics and possibly unjust accusations, he might have begun, perhaps subconsciously, to believe that the moral integrity and innate \"goodness\" of people from the gothic era had been lost in contemporary society. This notion is evident in several characters, including Frederic. Before meeting Frederic, the reader learns he embodies many chivalric qualities, described as:\n\nFrederic's portrayal includes numerous traditional chivalric images; he is primarily a prince who has endured hardship, suffered tragedy, and is thought to have been killed by infidels. The \"gallant and courteous Knight\" figure is exaggerated, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves a series of processes that move goods from the point of a customer's order through stages such as raw materials, supply, production, and distribution until they reach the customer. The concept of supply chain management was introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who defined it as the comprehensive process of planning, executing, and controlling supply chain operations to efficiently meet customer needs. There are six critical components of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to deliver optimal customer service.  \nProduction is the initial phase in the supply chain and serves as its cornerstone. This stage determines the timing, reasons, locations, and methods of production. Managers must understand customer preferences, which can be assessed by analyzing the market, the primary indicator of customer demand. Once managers comprehend market demands, they can decide on the products to manufacture and their quantities. Following these decisions, the next step is to determine the most suitable production facility, considering both volume and quality to meet customer satisfaction. After selecting the production site, managers focus on scheduling tasks and maintaining equipment. Production is a crucial element of the supply chain, where attention to detail is essential. Poor planning can result in significant time and financial losses for a company. For instance, in my experience working at Wal-Mart and Target, both retailers utilize structured guidelines and procedures for every business aspect, from employee uniforms to shipment reception. Such structured processes help companies operate efficiently, minimizing confusion and clarifying expectations.  \nThe second essential component of supply chain management is supply. Supply involves strategic decisions aimed at defining the core capabilities of a facility, with outsourcing partnerships developing from these decisions. A company might have various production divisions for a single product, each with different equipment, personnel, and expertise. Managers must determine which division best suits the different production processes. Additionally, management might opt to outsource work to other firms. The primary motivation for outsourcing is to enhance velocity, which is the ability to deliver quality and flexibility while keeping costs low or stable.",
            "Victorian novels are notable for their detailed descriptions and focus on the period's aristocracy. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights are two Victorian novels that diverge from this norm. These novels incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, which are uncommon in works from that era, enhancing the depth of their characters by offering insights into their motives and emotions.\n\n\"And now, a flood of bewildering and confusing thoughts crowded his mind. He felt as if he were still walking with Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily arguing, for he could hear their words; and when he focused on himself, he realized he was speaking to them. Suddenly, he was startled by the sound of gunfire, loud cries and shouts filled the air; lights flashed before his eyes, and everything was chaotic, as an unseen hand hurriedly carried him away. Amid these rapid visions, there was a vague, uneasy sense of pain that constantly tormented him.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nThe two novels frequently use mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and purpose differ in each instance. In Oliver Twist, these peculiar occurrences often reveal insights into Oliver's deeper layers, his struggles, and his understanding of the reality around him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he vividly relives it as if in a dream while trying to find help. This passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the events and the dire state of his health, which is evident in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing his senses, and he doesn't notice the \"unseen hand\" that carries him away; he re-experiences his despair, detached from the initial shock, as the pain is now constant and linked with fear instead of surprise. This overwhelming situation raises questions about who is responsible for his misfortune since it is certainly not Oliver himself. The shooting underscores Oliver's lack of control over his circumstances, as he cannot even attempt to influence the outcome of the events, even when his life is at risk. This selection implies a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, suggesting that old Fagin has begun to break him, pushing him into accepting despair and affecting his ability to react. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of his own life.\n\n\"The day passed – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as it arrived – and night came again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years back, I worked in an after-school program where I tutored elementary students. I aimed to assist them with any subjects they found difficult, although my expertise was in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to help a young boy named Adrian, who was in the third or fourth grade and struggling significantly with reading. I noticed something unusual about his difficulties; he could pronounce some letters perfectly while others were completely off, which was quite odd. Although Adrian was of Latino descent, he spoke flawless English. We continued having challenges until I met his mother. I was supervising a few kids who stayed behind while the rest went on a field trip when she came in. She didn’t speak English, only Spanish. Using my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate. That’s when I realized the issue: Adrian could read well, but he was unfamiliar with the English alphabet. I’m not sure if my discovery helped him much, but I hope he’s doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issue in schools, particularly in California. It also illustrates that the problem isn’t always obvious. Even a child who speaks perfect English can face significant reading challenges. Acknowledging that this issue exists is easy, but what do we do about it? For Adrian, the solution was straightforward: English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children who barely speak English, the solution is more complex. There isn't a single answer. A combination of dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes is necessary.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is beneficial, not only for children whose first language is Spanish but for all children. Studies show that children in bilingual programs often outperform their peers academically. There’s a lot of fear that this approach wastes resources and doesn’t benefit most students, but that’s incorrect. If these programs were standard rather than exceptions, all students would gain from them. But how do we implement this? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that would be unreasonable and somewhat unrealistic. However, there's no reason we can’t have special aides or tutors who are bilingual.",
            "From a young age, many of us are taught that there is something greater than ourselves, beyond our understanding. Some attend Sunday school to learn about it, others go to Temple, or seek answers within themselves. Many of us adopt the religions passed down by our parents, while some of us completely reject them, denying the existence of anything beyond our own egocentric world. We might embrace one set of beliefs, only to later change them for another. Whatever path we take, we strive to define a part of ourselves through our own spiritual perspectives. We search for guidance to lead us out of darkness and into the light.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father replied when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on our front porch, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof as we smoked together. The gutters spilled rainwater, drowning the plants along the porch's edge. He stared into the rain, a look that seemed part searching, part reminiscing. Over the past few months, he'd grown thinner, his clothes hanging loosely, and his hair was sparser than I remembered. He continued to gaze into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, scared, unable to express to him how much I would miss him, as speaking of it would make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer, and joined him in watching the rain fall in the June twilight.\n\nMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation hadn't eased his suffering but had prolonged his life a few months beyond the doctors' predictions; I couldn't see the value in just extending his pain. I wondered what kind of God would allow this. Alone in the night, I offered no prayers. If God existed, I felt He had long since stopped listening to me.\n\nI didn't want to witness him transition from this life to another. So I didn't. I couldn't bear to watch the end of the life that gave me life. I wanted to remember him for how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than anyone, better than his family, and I knew he wouldn't want his only child to witness his death. I stayed curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an enthusiastic early advocate of Republicanism. Although primarily a farmer, his profession, along with his short political career, made him known for his commitment to and outspoken views on personal freedom and government. His support for an agrarian system formed the foundation of nearly all his governmental opinions. His efforts to preserve and promote what he saw as the most esteemed career influenced his views on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the judicial system.  \nTaylor believed that the United States had a significant opportunity to establish an ideal system because there was no existing native tradition to constrain the government’s founders, allowing them to create a system of self-governance. He was a strong believer in the natural rights of individuals and argued that these rights are interconnected—if one is denied, they all fail, diminishing the value of those that remain. Therefore, these rights should be protected from government interference. He argued that what some referred to as the \"state of nature\" was a scenario where those with physical strength and malicious intelligence thrived, but this should not be the case in a civilized society.  \nTo build this ideal society, Taylor believed a government must be established that acknowledges the inherent good and evil within humans. Taylor held firm views on dualistic morality, asserting that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalism, and argued that a government founded on good principles would operate fairly, despite being led by greed and self-interest. He believed self-interest motivated all human actions but was only deemed evil when it extended beyond creating a society focused on the public good to forming sub-societies that exploited others. A good government was necessary to contain humanity's inherent evil, and it must be carefully monitored to prevent the introduction of bad principles.  \nTaylor, like many staunch Republicans of his era, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He desired a highly limited Federal government, with no more rights or powers than those explicitly granted in the Constitution. He understood that a large Federal government was costly and prone to despotism. However, he also believed that a simple, literal interpretation was risky and could easily become corrupt without considering the writers' intentions. Moreover, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defined the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind processing the scene before me with a detached clarity. Without any emotional involvement, I observed with a practiced focus that refused to connect the object of my observation to any abstract concepts. My thoughts came and went almost instantly, flowing so seamlessly that it seemed as though I had no real thoughts of my own—just a fluid experience of what I was viewing.\n\nOnce, following advice from an artist I collaborated with, I bought an instructional book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had aspired to draw since I was six, and this book covered everything from understanding a pencil to the brain's methods for interpreting lines. One method it taught was to place a square frame around any image the artist wanted to study, transforming a complex scene, like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room, into a manageable picture of just the bowl of fruit on a simple surface.\n\nAt that moment, as I looked down at the bowl before me, I couldn't mentally apply that artist's frame. Overwhelmed and in awe, I could only stand and marvel. Picasso had his blue period, Monet admired greenery, and Italian Renaissance artists displayed a spectrum of colors. If I had any notions of my perspective being artistically valuable, then in front of me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers touched my chosen tool of creativity. Muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand moved through space, transforming my mind's intention into what might have been the most imaginative moment of my life. Water swirled, calm and clear. Flakes of matter detached and drifted away. Muscles tightened, and with a bit more urgency, my hand slapped the toilet handle again. The stubborn brown mass remained, stuck like a slug at the bottom of the toilet.\n\nMop loosely in hand, feet spaced a foot apart, and a green tie uncomfortably knotted around my neck, I frowned slightly at the offensive bundle of processed matter someone had left as a message for those who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid. After a few more flushes and some tranquil, introspective moments, my hand reached for the toilet paper, wrapping itself until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand slowly dipped into the bowl, like a mother reaching into the oven for the Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "Teen drivers are losing their lives in car accidents. Various factors contribute to this alarming trend among America's youngest drivers. According to the National Institutes of Health, a significant issue is that teenagers' brains are not fully equipped to handle driving hazards. Their lack of experience is another core problem, leading not only to more fatal crashes but also to increased incidents of rollovers, speeding, and losing control of the vehicle. Additionally, teenagers are at greater risk when driving with their peers, a common occurrence. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has found a link between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents.\n\nTo improve teen driver safety, states like California have implemented temporary provisional licenses that impose restrictions on driving hours and passenger limits for minors. However, I believe these provisional licenses are merely temporary solutions. The fundamental issue is that young drivers, as a demographic, are statistically unprepared to manage the inherent risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even at age 18, individuals may be too young for a standard driver's license. USA Today highlights Zuckerman's research, which suggests that people under 19-20 have a propensity for thrill-seeking. Therefore, it might be prudent to delay driving until this tendency diminishes. If we continue to license young teens, fatal accidents will persist, and the death toll could rise dramatically in the coming years, especially as the children of Baby Boomers become eligible to drive by 2010, increasing the number of teen drivers on the roads.\n\nAddressing this issue through legislation could be relatively simple. Schools could still offer driver's education to prepare future drivers, but no one under 18 should be allowed to drive. Provisional permits could still be issued before a full license, with a requirement for a specific number of practical driving hours, similar to current state requirements, such as California's six hours of driving instruction and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Given that the troubling statistics for teen drivers are consistent across states, a uniform national law could be a sensible and effective way to protect teens nationwide. The legislative approach I propose is not new.",
            "This paper explores three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with a concise definition of the disorder, followed by an explanation of its diagnosis, highlighting key characteristics or \"red flags.\" The paper concludes with strategies that teachers in mainstream classrooms can use to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), involves the central nervous system's (CNS) ability to process auditory information efficiently and effectively. More specifically, (C)APD pertains to the perceptual processing of sounds within the CNS and the neurobiological activity that supports this processing, leading to electrophysiological auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it is a condition where the brain struggles to properly process auditory information. Individuals with CAPD have normal hearing and are not classified as \"hearing impaired\"; instead, the brain region responsible for interpreting what is heard, such as differentiating words or distinguishing conversation from background noise, does not function as it should.\n\nThe first reference to the disorder later known as CAPD dates back to the mid-1950s, initially termed \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), during research on children with communication disorders. In 1954, the Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started developing tests for these children. By 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the physiology of the central auditory nervous system (CANS) underlying dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 further stimulated research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways, including difficulty localizing or hearing sounds in space, distinguishing between multiple acoustic events, recognizing sound patterns, detecting changes in speech (such as sarcasm), experiencing sound masking, synthesizing auditory clues into meaningful actions, and determining the sequence of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves screening the patient through \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,\" which can be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals using various measures to evaluate auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This process may include questionnaires, surveys, and observations of auditory behavior, assessing how the patient responds to specific stimuli. Currently, no single tool or test consistently achieves a high diagnostic success rate, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Many tests involve presenting the patient with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and asking them to differentiate certain items, such as a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to those signals.",
            "In my pursuit of a social work education, I aim to build a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on aiding children who have suffered abuse or neglect and offering support to families in crisis. The values I bring to social work include service, respect, ethics, a commitment to fostering better relationships among people, and a dedication to professional self-improvement to maintain competence. These values are not only crucial to social workers but are also personally significant to me.\n\nI have always been driven to help others, though I was initially uncertain about which career path to take. During high school and college, I noticed many people avoiding their problems or resorting to unhealthy coping methods. These observations led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. However, still unsure about my career direction, I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, a visit to a friend introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy on her couch, who was there to escape his abusive parents. The following day, I learned he had contacted the police regarding his situation. Eager to assist, I visited his parents’ home, expressed my concerns to the police, and mentioned my recent Psychology degree. The police asked me to speak with the parents, as the law offered no solution for the teenager. When I confronted the parents, they appeared uneasy and offered excuses for their son's \"manipulative\" behavior in seeking outside help for \"simple\" family disputes. This experience prompted me to seriously consider a career in social work to aid children facing such \"simple\" family conflicts.\n\nAnother crucial value in social work is social justice. Society often emphasizes the importance of the individual and mourns those lost, yet clings to outdated traditions rather than true individuality. If we mourn lost individuals, why do we strive for conformity? I embrace my individuality and resist limiting myself to fit in. Throughout high school and college, I actively protested against social injustice, whether it was through expressing myself with bold hair colors, wearing clothes that reflected my personality, getting multiple ear piercings, joining the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), or speaking out against racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. I firmly believe in social justice and will continue to oppose social injustice.",
            "This paper examines the Biological and Sociocultural models concerning the disorder insomnia. The biological model emphasizes inherited genetic information and medical health aspects. In contrast, the Sociocultural models consider environmental relationships and their relevance to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The review of insomnia explores these models, discussing each selected study to enhance understanding of the models. The research explanations and findings are critiqued for their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified as primary sleep disorders, those related to another mental disorder, or those linked to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while sleep disorders associated with another mental disorder relate to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorder categories may result from medical conditions or substance use. Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in achieving or maintaining sleep, whereas Primary Hypersomnia involves trouble staying awake, both persisting for at least a month. Narcolepsy is characterized by cataplexy and/or automatic REM. Dyssomnias focus on sleep initiation and maintenance, while Parasomnias involve behavioral or physiological abnormalities during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep issues due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily focuses on insomnia and, to some extent, primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genes, heritable factors, and physiological aspects related to sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study conducted on mice revealed that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are responsible for sleep/wake states. Activating the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep, and inhibiting it can reduce anxiety and promote sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) was found to increase sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that mouse models can be extrapolated to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A malfunction or absence of this receptor could impair the ability to achieve adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication is that if the phenotype is inherited, it may regulate sleep, and any alteration in the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep, adversely affecting aspects of life such as education, career, and daily activities requiring focus and monotony.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for roughly two and a half years, equating to four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many, myself included. During my freshman year, I lived in a dorm in East Halls, which is essentially the farthest eastern point of the campus, aside from the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard building, located near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes, especially in the frequently bad weather typical of State College. An alum I spoke to, not much older than myself, mentioned that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the university by large expanses of unused land. Now, that space is occupied by sports fields, large new buildings such as the new Creamery and health services building, and is surrounded by apartments. As our campus continues to grow, moving from one area to another becomes increasingly difficult. What’s the best solution to the mobility issue? On a college campus, it's the bicycle. But simply having bikes isn't enough; students need to use them, and the campus should be designed to accommodate cyclists.\n\nI spoke with a friend who recently started biking again after several years. He expressed surprise at why he ever stopped, saying, \"Bikes are great. For a while, it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” Bicycling not only benefits your health but is also the most efficient mode of travel. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical effort can cover 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off-campus, about as far from the campus center as some dorms. The smartest decision I made this year was to purchase a bike. I have a class in the Thomas building every day, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. Biking can reduce that time to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. The only issue is that Pollock Road is the most direct route to the Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, whether on a bike or on foot. Walking has its merits, but I'm too busy for it. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable means to reach class. Walking to Thomas every day would consume an extra 30-40 minutes of my day, totaling over two and a half hours each week. Adding in the time spent walking to other classes and appointments, that's more time than I can afford.",
            "In \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley criticizes the looming dangers of technology and the capitalist systems that support it by depicting a dystopian society. In this world, people prioritize community over individuality and are conditioned from birth to seek immediate gratification above all else. The citizens are mere pawns in a larger scheme, bound to a single ideology as determined by the World Controller. Through a Marxist lens, one can discern Huxley's skepticism towards the development of these systems. Marxist terms such as homogeny and reification underscore the notion that Huxley's novel critiques the shortcomings of the emerging economy of his era. \n\nCapitalism is critiqued through the Marxist concept of false consciousness. Essentially, ordinary citizens are prevented from understanding their true economic relationships with other classes, as they are focused solely on their own benefits. This is attributed to the ideological control over the proletariat and common workers, clearly demonstrated by the conditioning of people in \"Brave New World.\" The lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, lack true autonomy; through hypnopaedia, the urge to consume, spend, and indulge is prioritized above all else. This manipulation is orchestrated by the World Controller. Hegemony, the idea that social classes are dominated entirely by another group, is evident here. The lower classes remain unaware of their manipulation, quite literally 'buying into an ideology that supports that structure' (i.e., capitalism and consumerism). The upper classes have the capacity to recognize this manipulation but remain passive; few Alphas or Betas, beyond characters like Bernard, challenge their roles. The interactions between social classes, as further discussed, highlight the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" genuine relationships between individuals are absent. The novel seemingly does not differentiate characters, even among main figures, who lack depth. Huxley may be implying that the combination of technological and capitalist advances strips individuals of their free will and self-expression. Love and emotional extremes are nonexistent; interactions are superficial, notably reflected in how men discuss women primarily based on their physical attributes (such as their 'pneumatic' quality), and how women openly comment on their encounters. Additionally, each societal class's contentment with their hierarchical status reflects the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their unwavering compliance with their societal roles highlights Marxist views on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform with their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in an Islam course at CBC. A significant topic that sparked intense debate in the class was whether Islam is inherently hostile. I feel this question is even more pertinent today than it was in the past. Reflecting on the events since 9/11, I've noticed a shift in the media's portrayal of Islam, from a hostile perspective towards extremists to a more tolerant stance regarding Islam in America. Back in 2001, it seemed unlikely that a presidential candidate with a name like Barack Obama, who has evident Muslim heritage in his family, could emerge.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet fascinates me because, based on my understanding of Muhammad's history, it seems to contradict his character. From what I previously knew, I believed Muhammad compelled people to convert to Islam, conquering tribes and imposing the religion on them. However, the biography portrays Muhammad as a martyr who was misunderstood and demonstrated humility to others, leading people to gradually recognize the 'truth' in his teachings and seek him out.\n\nFurthermore, there are striking similarities between Jesus' ministry and the 'miracles' attributed to Muhammad. One notable instance is when Muhammad supposedly multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men. This narrative style suggests that the authors aimed to depict Muhammad as a humble prophet who lived truthfully and performed miracles without needing to prove himself. I find this problematic as it diminishes the miracles and life of Jesus Christ, as if they are trying to attribute Jesus' significance to Muhammad.\n\nAdditionally, many stories in the biography appear to serve an agenda of demonstrating how people converted to Islam 'on their own.' However, these accounts are often relayed from a third-party perspective, such as hearing from someone who heard from another, and so on. This approach, intended to validate the stories, instead made them seem less credible and more suspicious to me.\n\nWhat troubles me most about the work is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure—humble, wise, and gentle. Yet, historical accounts contradict the notion of Muhammad being gentle and humble, and I wonder if contemporary Muslims are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's ascent to power.",
            "The core teachings and beliefs of Jesus during his lifetime were quickly set aside as Christian thought evolved after his death. Observing this historical trajectory, it becomes evident that Christianity has gradually drifted away from its original roots. In today's world, there is a growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive attitude. While traditionalists exist and will resist any thinking beyond what they have been taught, they may not have enough influence to sway the entire population. Among Christians, awareness of history is expected to expand significantly in the coming years, sparking a desire to differentiate the doctrines added over time from the true intentions of Jesus. Although it may take decades or even centuries, the outcome seems inevitable: a significant reversal in the trend of Christian history, moving back to its original form. A movement will emerge, gradually peeling away layers of doctrine as if time were reversing, until only the essence of what Jesus introduced to humanity remains, before other thinkers made their claims. As this trend spreads across the United States and Europe, influencing many to practice faith as if they were living in Jesus' time, following only his teachings, the church as an institution will remain strong to guide the way. However, with the theological clock moving backward, the current diversity within Christianity will give way to increasing uniformity in belief and practice. Differences between regions, denominations, and divisions will diminish, resulting in greater similarities. Human history is marked by significant reversals, such as when Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, which later became a Christian institution. Our country has transitioned from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The forthcoming great reversion will unfold within the realm of Christianity, seeking to return to its origins and reducing diversity in the process. A crucial element in this transformation will be interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically rather than literally. So, what has transpired since Jesus' time? Looking far back into history reveals only Judaism, the theological precursor to Christianity. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the concept of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were central to the faith. However, the Jewish population was not unified, dividing into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I think that \"The Jungle\" illustrates how people are inherently greedy and self-serving. They focus solely on improving their own lives without considering those beneath them. This is evident throughout the book, particularly in the behavior of the factory owners and managers. They prioritize expanding their businesses, with no concern for the people or things harmed in the process. Upton Sinclair's narrative describes the destructive impact of pollution, highlighting the owners' disregard for human and animal welfare. They overlook the smoke pouring from the factories and the waste from the livestock pens in Packingtown.\n\nFurthermore, the owners and managers show little concern for their workers, who toil to make them wealthy. They exploit their employees to maximize profits, with \"a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds\" prevailing throughout the workplace, where financial gain takes precedence over human value. Workers endure long hours and face sudden mass layoffs without compensation or job placement assistance. During the time period depicted in \"The Jungle,\" there were few, if any, laws ensuring worker safety and wellbeing, allowing for rampant exploitation and poor working conditions. Although the book doesn't explicitly state it, those who lived and worked in Packingtown were expected to endure the harsh realities both on the job and in their living environments, with no support from agencies or organizations. While unions existed, they often exploited the workers instead of aiding them. The dire treatment and lack of escape from Packingtown's system left workers akin to slaves, described as a \"low-class and mostly foreign\" population teetering on starvation, reliant on ruthless management reminiscent of slave drivers. Under such conditions, immorality was as prevalent and inevitable as in the era of chattel slavery.",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is considered by Edgar Allan Poe to be one of his finer poems. In this work, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which scholar Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil mentioned Thulé as an island located north of Britain, regarded by the Greeks as the boundary of the known world. While Virgil indeed used the term, there is a more contemporary source that deserves acknowledgment. Poe had a keen interest in German authors. This connection is significant as it highlights Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" notes the similarities between their poems, suggesting that Poe was imitating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned writer of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe’s death. Within the second part of \"Faust\" is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells of a king whose wife dies after gifting him a goblet. In mourning, he drinks heavily and cries over his lost queen. Eventually, he resolves to die, giving his possessions to his children, except for the goblet, which he throws into the sea before closing his eyes and dying. The king's demeanor in \"The King of Thulé\" and the description of the king in \"Dream-Land\" are quite similar, possibly reflecting a dark mirror of Poe's own experiences with loss and drinking. \"Faust\" was also adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just before Poe's use of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe mentions Thule twice in his collected works. He references \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and uses the phrase twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be viewed as complementary pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes Thule’s landscape as dark and lonely, haunted by the memories of deceased friends, and devoid of color. These visions resonate with \"The King of Thulé,\" where the king, having lost his wife, is lonely and lacks the will to rule or live. The entire poem seems to depict the speaker stepping into Goethe’s creation.\n\nGoethe was an influential author whom Poe would have known, if only through his admiration for Tennyson. Poe expressed his respect for Tennyson and, through this connection, would have been exposed to Goethe’s work, which was widely reproduced after its original release.",
            "Under California law, a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store might be entitled to punitive damages if it can be shown that the store manager acted with malice by neglecting to clean the spill for half an hour, despite being informed twice, because he was having dinner. It's unlikely that a judge would outright dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive damages. To justify such a claim, a plaintiff must provide evidence that the defendant acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm their conduct could cause, and that the conduct was despicable. Palmer could argue that Martin should have anticipated the harm from not cleaning a spill, given that several D&D customers had previously been injured in similar incidents in the months before her accident. Despite this awareness, Martin did not address the spill. Although Palmer’s claim that Martin’s actions were despicable is less compelling, it remains plausible considering that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009, yet Martin still failed to ensure store safety.  \n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin, who was on a dinner break, dismissed the issue, saying he \"didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also informed Martin of the spill, receiving the same response. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill, suffering a severe back injury. Before Palmer’s accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been recorded at D&D’s in 2009. Palmer is suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages for her injuries, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, punitive damages can be awarded for breaches not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice\" (Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010)). The law defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm or, if not intentional, conduct that is \"despicable\" and performed with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others\" (id. at § (c)(1)). The courts have described conduct as malicious when it is carried out with a conscious disregard for the plaintiff’s rights and where the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences\" (Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979)).",
            "She had always felt a sense of longing, an unfulfilled desire that emerged when she was about 14, just starting her teenage years. This yearning persisted even three years later at 17. By then, she realized she was searching for someone, not something. However, she hadn't developed any interest in boys, despite some showing interest in her with awkward efforts to win her over. She often questioned herself about this unusual feeling, pondering what could make such a peculiar thing happen to a teenage girl. Years of reflection had produced theories, but none convincing enough for her to dwell on. So she continued living her life, constantly questioning her desires.\n\nAt home, days were usually peaceful. Her parents were calm and gentle people, rarely arguing with each other or with her. Their only disagreements were about her asserting her independence and free spirit. She was the lively daughter of a serene couple, her vibrant and fun personality making her well-liked along with her kindness.\n\nBut today wasn't peaceful. As she moved around the house searching for new inspiration, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, her mother's lovely voice. She rushed to the room, panicking as she frantically asked, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the floor, appearing to be in pain, repeatedly saying \"Ow\" with short breaths. The daughter hurried to her side, trying to help. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital,\" her mother said in rushed, strained words, indicating she was in severe pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Following her mother's guidance, she felt grateful for the strength she had gained from her classes. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the back, and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital visit was filled with the smell of disinfectant and an atmosphere of fear and illness, but she was too focused on aiding her mother to notice. She swiftly carried her injured mother inside and called for medical assistance. Several concerned faces gathered, and someone quickly brought a rolling bed to lay her mother on. They immediately took her for examination, leaving her daughter to anxiously wait.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a stepping stool while trying to reach a vase from their highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a decreased risk of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet is an adjusted version of the Med diet, characterized by increased consumption of plant foods, such as plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (in preference to saturated fats), and fish, with a reduced intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown an inverse relationship between adherence to a Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, and an intervention trial found the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, prior studies did not specifically address stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) that evaluated nutrient intake over the previous year. Over 95% of the nurses continued their participation throughout the 20-year period, and the FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed via medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, cases were deemed \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts classified as such. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of postmenopausal hormones were calculated for each FFQ, and from 1986 onwards, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo minimize individual random variation and better capture long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were computed (averaging scores from the previous two years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could obscure results) by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the relationship between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with distinct models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nA higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as shown by an elevated aMed diet score, was linked with a reduced risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up, there were 2,391 new CHD cases, 1,763 new stroke cases, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (including fatal CHD and strokes combined). Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The sign declares, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" \n\nEllen Page, known for her role in Juno, stands alone on a street corner holding a cardboard sign with this disturbing message, written in Sharpie. Burma, now called Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by an oppressive military junta that seized power in a 1962 coup. In 2007, the country witnessed its first public demonstrations in a decade, led mainly by Burmese monks. These protests became known as \"The Saffron Revolution,\" named after the monks' saffron-colored robes. Initially, the government allowed the monks to protest peacefully, but the situation soon deteriorated into what many viewed as a full-scale conflict between the monks and the military junta, with the military invading and pillaging monasteries nationwide. Foreign journalists were detained and imprisoned, with Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai being killed on September 27, 2007, simply for attending a street protest. Although the official death toll was reported as 13, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army shortly before the official announcement, claimed that \"many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is not a new phenomenon. While these examples are among the more recent atrocities in our world, the desire of governments to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over their citizens has existed throughout history. Early Roman emperors proclaimed themselves divinely chosen to have complete authority over every aspect of society. Japanese emperors were believed to be gods themselves, sent to lead their people to prosperity. Meanwhile, then-U.S. President George W. Bush reportedly had regular calls with Ted Haggard, leader of an organization for uninformed individuals, affiliated with the Republican Party.\n\nNotable historical examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to challenge authoritarian rule. The death toll from this event is disputed, with Chinese government reports stating 200-300 deaths, while the Chinese Red Cross reported 2,000-3,000. Another instance is the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s, where Hutu militias, backed by the government, systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of their ethnicity. Hitler's 'Third Reich' is another extreme case, involving the widespread persecution and execution of Jews across multiple countries.",
            "Duke Ellington's significant contribution to jazz is largely attributed to his long career and his exceptional ability to shape his orchestra creatively. While his presence at the piano is understated in many of the compositions for this assignment, as a composer, Ellington was adept at crafting intricate and layered pieces that highlighted the talents of individual band members. He designed frameworks that allowed soloists to improvise freely, alongside composing tightly orchestrated segments that leveraged the unique styles of his musicians to enhance musical concepts. In this way, he also accentuated the overall tone of the orchestra, producing cohesive and original sounds for each composition. Ellington's expertise in understanding the distinct sounds of his musicians and how they integrated within an expanding ensemble enabled him to create some of the most innovative and remarkable works in jazz history. The Grove Music dictionary, when discussing Ellington's sound and innovation, cites \"Creole Love Call\" as an example of his use of the voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This early piece illustrates Ellington's application of the voice to add texture and color without relying on lyrics. \"Creole Love Call\" also showcases Ellington's knack for complementing the style of his soloists, a skill evident throughout his career. This measured, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece consists of six choruses: Chorus 1 features a call and response between voice and reeds, transitioning from a smooth, melodic start to a rougher end. Chorus 2 has a muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the main melody, highlighting several extended blue notes. Chorus 3 includes a sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, supported by a subtle syncopated piano phrase. Chorus 4 sees the full band echoing the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections. Chorus 5 is the climactic section, with the reeds initiating the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. Chorus 6 revisits the first chorus's structure, with call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice employs the \"growl\" technique, soloing like an instrument. The piece concludes with a brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by the trombone. Ellington's use of voice to add tonal color to this piece is a stylistic hallmark throughout his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington merges his skill in tight orchestration with his sensitivity to tone color. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing blends the vocal qualities of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice, creating a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" further develops these ideas, as Ellington effectively utilizes Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a regular in Ellington's orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "What drives the evolution of organisms in specific ways? Are there limitations that shape the path of evolutionary changes? In 1917, D’Arcy Thompson remarked that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" and this statement still holds true today. Recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to understand general aspects of mollusk shell formation throughout their development and evolutionary history (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of developmental and evolutionary changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help reveal the mechanisms behind the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental changes. We used X-ray images of Prunum species to define quantitative parameters for modeling both hypothetical and real shell shapes. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We created models of potential shell shapes to explore the limits of morphological change in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a deeper understanding of major evolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be imagined as a tube that moves over time through 360 degrees of space. The turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which whorls expand can vary, with a continuous line called a suture marking each whorl. Typically, the largest whorl in a shell is the final one, known as the body whorl. The spire consists of all whorls except the last, with the apex marking the tip of the spire and the opposite end called the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The \"usual\" orientation is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.)\n\nTo count whorls, begin by viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying where the first suture starts. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell into two sections. Whorls are counted from this line and estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a sequence of apertures that progress through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced using the coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture, along with the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be depicted both graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical model is established, it is possible to adjust parameters and alter the mollusk’s shell formation process.",
            "Over the past decade, the rates of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia have remained largely unchanged. Although the nation is progressing towards several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, the improvements in child and maternal health are insufficient to reach the 2015 targets. The reasons for these deficiencies will be explored below, highlighting the necessity of enhancing the health system rather than concentrating solely on program-specific interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen progress in the number of births attended by skilled health workers, with 72% currently meeting this criterion. However, this statistic includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who cannot perform medical interventions in complicated pregnancies, which contributes to the high rate of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. Thus, the advancements in this indicator may be somewhat deceptive, indicating much work still needs to be done. Moreover, there is a decrease in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five being treated by healthcare professionals. Although data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is evident that this is also an area of concern, with low rates reported nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain below expectations at around 4%. The disparity in c-section rates—7% in urban areas compared to just 2% in rural areas—highlights a significant issue of unequal healthcare access. Clearly, healthcare services are concentrated in urban locales. Access issues also relate to vertical equity, with a 27% gap in service use between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles, suggesting that the poor have far more difficulty accessing healthcare, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn considering future strategies for improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the fundamental question is how best to address the lack of services. Should Indonesia focus on developing program-specific strategies or on strengthening the overall health system without singling out pre and postnatal care for mothers and children? While targeted programmatic approaches are appealing due to their precise, manageable goals and typically quicker results, they come with certain drawbacks. A significant downside is that concentrating resources on one health sector often leads to neglect in others, with human resources gravitating towards better-funded areas (as seen with international funding for HIV/AIDS impacting the family planning sector). Additionally, running multiple parallel programs can lead to redundant and uncoordinated services, increasing the administrative burden for supplies and funding applications.",
            "Over the last century, the classification of Popular Music has expanded so much that it is challenging to list all the genres. Adding to the complexity, nearly all genres—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—have given rise to numerous sub-genres and even sub-sub-genres. One could argue that the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has evolved into one of the most varied and expressive genres in popular music over the past 40 years. Its expressiveness comes from its broad emotional range, often leaning toward darker themes. The diversity of Heavy Metal became evident soon after its inception, as people recognized its flexibility and began creating their own sub-genres, leading to further sub-sub-genres, a trend that continues today.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal movement has diversified into so many niche groups that defining what constitutes heavy metal has become challenging. It has incorporated a wide array of themes from other genres, but, like anything else, it originated from somewhere. To truly understand the metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp what the metal movement is and why it is considered a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nIn many respects, metal is a movement characterized by darkness. It can be described as a \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more aggression, more theatricality. It is less primitive and more sophisticated; musicians in metal bands are highly skilled, and this proficiency is evident in their music. Metal is also a movement heavily influenced by drugs, particularly during the psychedelic drug surge in the mid-70s, which led to increasingly wild and other-worldly music, with drugs serving as a catalyst for creation. It possesses many dark, visceral qualities that were new to the music scene as much of popular music tended to avoid the darker emotional spectrum. Additionally, later generations of metal have drawn some inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities prominent during the Romantic Era. Lyrics like those in \"Helter Skelter\" illustrate the darkness that is central to the movement.\n\nThe lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" showcase the darker side of The Beatles, reflecting a turbulent, possibly drug-influenced journey. This song is sometimes considered one of the first Heavy Metal tracks, created in response to a Rolling Stones song with similarly heavy, dark themes. The Beatles wanted to demonstrate they could be just as intense as the Stones, so they included this song on The White Album.",
            "Several decades before the Surrealists started creating their dream-inspired art, Henri Rousseau was meticulously developing his own dreams, both in reality and in his imagination. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only depicts a woman marveling at the wonders of a dream world but also embodies Rousseau’s personal aspirations and ambitions as an artist. Since he began his artistic journey, Rousseau longed for recognition, acceptance, and acclaim from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet he grappled with a significant internal conflict to fulfill this ambition. The Dream illustrates Rousseau’s lifelong internal struggle to either conform to or imitate popular art styles to gain acceptance within the critical art community he admired, or to maintain his creative independence and forge his own path.\n\nTo fully appreciate The Dream from this perspective, one must first understand Rousseau’s background. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who experienced \"bourgeois prosperity\" (Shattuck 47). Without any formal artistic training, Rousseau worked until the age of forty in France’s municipal toll service, known as a gabelou, though he was mistakenly referred to as a douanier, or customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The loss of his first wife Clémence, following the deaths of eight infant children, left him with one surviving daughter, Julia, and deep sorrow (Shattuck 49). Seeking solace and a new beginning, Rousseau turned to painting for comfort. Unlike his contemporaries who idealized the peasant life in their art, Rousseau was fundamentally a folk painter with the aspirations common to his social class.\n\nRousseau’s intense desire for acceptance in the art world is understandable considering his circumstances: he was self-taught, started his artistic career later in life, and was creating art alongside many other renowned modern artists. Despite years of work, Rousseau only began to receive due recognition around the same time Matisse was establishing his reputation. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes that although Rousseau and Matisse were technically rivals, they differed in style, subject matter, and their motivations for painting: “Matisse feared painting in a clichéd manner, while Rousseau aspired to create art so conventional he would gain entry to the Artiste Français” (92).",
            "Numerous prominent thinkers have suggested a deep link between ethics and aesthetics, as well as between truth and beauty. I think there is a fundamental reason for this connection. As John Keats expresses in “Ode on a Grecian Urn,” “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of our knowledge comes from education or experience, but we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics naturally, as Keats hints, without formal teaching. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than dictate. Our exploration of morality and beauty primarily seeks to explain why a piece of art or literature is appealing, or why an action is moral, rather than establishing rules for evaluating or creating good art or moral conduct.\n\nMoreover, critiques of art or morals never fully capture the essence of what is good or beautiful. Discussions on the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but ultimately, these do not explain why it is considered good art. Often, when asked about a favored artwork or literary piece, people might say, “There's just something about it,” before offering a more detailed critique. I believe that art and morals cannot be entirely reduced to their characteristics. As Flannery O'Connor states, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how thoroughly we describe a literary work, something transcendent remains. I think ethics shares this quality. Wittgenstein notes, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.” I propose that this “something,” this indefinable quality, is the most compelling aspect of art and morality, and that this transcendental nature provides a connection between them.\n\nI believe the close relationship between morality and art arises because we experience both most profoundly at a noumenal level, to use a Kantian concept. They affect us in ways that can be felt, but not entirely explained. This connection is even more pronounced in literature. As McKean remarks, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Modern Germany is seen as a powerful and unified nation, showcasing a diverse culture that stretches from the Alpine shadows in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This cultural richness extends from Cologne on the Rhine River, through the heart of Germany, to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. It's not surprising that contemporary Germany's culture stems from various sources and tribes.\n\nThe ancestral homeland of the Germans is known as Germania. The name's origin is a subject of debate among scholars and historians. Tacitus suggested it derived from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before crossing the Rhine to confront the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he subdued the Gauls and clashed with Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine under dubious motives. He borrowed this term from the Gauls themselves to differentiate between the Gauls he had conquered and the tribes he had not. While the exact origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighboring tribe in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter of his first book on these wars, Caesar mentions: \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others suggest the name could originate from the spear they used in warfare, called a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim, meaning \"to shout,\" implying that the Germans were loud or noisy (Names of Germany).\n\nIn his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" the early Roman historian Tacitus chronicled the origins of the Germans, asserting, \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)\" (Tacitus, 98).\n\nAnd who would choose to leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, at least not initially. They would send expeditions to Germania for goods and occasionally launch land campaigns, but typically they returned to their vast empire. As Germanic tribes began to emerge in the mid-first century, they settled on the Roman Empire's borders, trading goods from the land and serving as skilled soldiers in the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "In the play Twelfth Night, it suggests that while disguises can be effective tools for sustaining prolonged deception, ultimately, one must abandon these false identities to avoid losing their true selves. However, ending a deception can lead to feelings of alienation. Ultimately, a person must choose between self-preservation and maintaining relationships with those around them. Some may react indifferently upon discovering they've been deceived, while others may take offense at the deception. The issue of deception in gender role reversal brings additional complexities, most notably questioning why someone would feel compelled to abandon their own identity to adopt that of the opposite gender. For Viola, it is clearly a means of self-protection: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Upon arriving in an unfamiliar place, Viola finds it necessary to disguise herself as a man to ensure her safety from potential threats. Her plan succeeds, but it also isolates her from other women, severing her from a crucial support network. Complicating matters further, Viola's male disguise is so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and inadvertently falls in love with her, as shown by Olivia's plea: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, Viola must navigate her own repressed romantic feelings towards Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261). While this situation might seem progressive, modern readers might view Twelfth Night as a depiction of how deception can uncover hidden emotions, particularly for Olivia and Orsino. Certain sections suggest that these characters might have unspoken desires that Viola/Cesario’s presence compels them to confront. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because she perceives him as a man, or does she secretly have feelings for women? One might argue against this, as Shakespeare's portrayal of Olivia seems to satirize those of his era who judge others solely on appearance. This is demonstrated by how easily Olivia shifts her romantic interest from Cesario to Sebastian, eventually seeing Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German colonial rule has been characterized by many as particularly harsh, especially concerning the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in what was then German South West Africa. However, it's overly simplistic to describe an entire colonial empire with a single broad stroke. The policies and governance of the German colonial empire were as diverse as the territories it encompassed. Similarly, the educational systems varied across the colonies. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (now Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a significant number of educated and literate Africans. German efforts in education within Kamerun and other colonies received commendation from writers of the era. The scenario in South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) was notably different. Unlike East Africa, where the government established state schools and actively participated in educating the local population, in South West Africa, education for the natives was largely left to missionary groups with minimal government assistance. However, the government heavily invested in the education of Europeans in the region, setting up state schools and providing more substantial support and regulation for missionary schools. These policies continued to impact South West Africa long after German rule ended. While other German colonies had significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to the unique circumstances of South West Africa. This paper aims to delve into these factors, with a focus on recent research regarding the perspectives of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans. There is an extensive body of literature specifically addressing education in the German colonial empire. Most of these works, written in German during or shortly after the colonial period, aimed to describe the educational systems in these colonies. Later English-language studies expanded the conversation by comparing educational systems across different German colonies and analyzing specific educational aspects in greater detail. These studies highlighted significant differences between the colonies' educational systems. Cohen's work, a prominent study, explicitly addresses the theme of this paper by comparing the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa and discussing the factors accounting for their differences. According to Cohen, the large European settler population in South West Africa explains many of the unique features of its educational system. Compared to Germany's other colonies, South West Africa had a somewhat temperate climate, despite much of its land being arid desert. The European population reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans resided in South West Africa, while the next largest settler population was in East Africa, with only 5,336 Europeans.",
            "The United States and Mexico are examples of two countries that experienced a long-standing rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The peak of this conflict was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, gaining Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Numerous other conflicts occurred between the two nations, eventually subsiding just before World War I. The rivalry was fueled by clashes over key issues such as religion, culture, tradition, and significant material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis situation is similar to that of many other countries that have enduring rivalries with neighboring nations. Countries that share borders often experience conflicts of interest that lead to rival positions. The United States and Mexico are similar to many enduring rivalries between nations that share a common border. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, both of these countries are geographically close to the United States and have historically been rivals, while other Latin American countries have enjoyed good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences created a division between the two nations, a common issue throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). Similar to the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was both an ideological struggle and a competition over vital interests, the conflict here was based not on political structures but on religious preferences. This distrust stemmed from historical tensions between the English and Spanish, which were inherited from their former colonial rulers and posed a significant challenge in establishing friendly foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identified 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry. Most of these disputes, as described by Diehl and Goerts, involved territorial issues, such as border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier problems. Raids by bandits and outlaws into American border towns were a significant issue until both the United States and Mexico used military force to secure their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). Schmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry began to fade as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and concluded as American ambitions shifted \"from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p. 110) in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was unexpectedly and suddenly disabled by an illness I had never heard of. At that time, I was a nurse, a career I chose because of a strong desire for the safety and security I lacked during childhood. I often heard the saying, \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick,\" as I grew up. Even though my aspirations were to become a scientist or journalist—or perhaps a bit of both—I opted for nursing.\n\nNonetheless, there I was at 46 years old, single, with little savings and unable to work. I am still disabled today, and after 15 years of relying on Social Security Disability, I have almost nothing left that I can call my own. I manage to get by, but every day is a challenge, threatening my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Nothing in my life is predictable anymore, yet one thing remains true: I wouldn't have survived all these years without the support of my family and a few good friends, no matter how strong I believed myself to be. When true disaster hits, you don't feel strong at all.\n\nMy point is that emergencies, both big and small, are inevitable in life. There are no guarantees, and despite our best preparations, some challenges are too great to face alone.\n\nI completely agree that in the U.S., we should stop relying solely on big government, which is clearly deteriorating and ineffective. However, I would much prefer to see Americans learning to trust and assist one another and asking for help, rather than each of us individually retreating to build fallout shelters.\n\nConservatives in the U.S. often speak about the \"rugged individualism\" that built the nation, but truthfully, what sustained our ancestors during tough times was not rugged individualism but rather compassion, mutual respect, and resource sharing. The pioneers who journeyed across the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, definitely be prepared—I am. I have a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, plastic sheeting, and duct tape for windows in case of a biological attack. I own several flashlights, various batteries, plenty of candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and can preserve your own food, go for it. It's an excellent idea, as is having a wood stove, as long as you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while doing all this, make sure to get to know your neighbors.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born who would later be known as Buddha. Throughout his life, he gave up worldly possessions, achieved enlightenment, and his teachings laid the groundwork for Buddhism. The most traditional branch of this religion is called Theravada Buddhism. Buddhism has existed for about 2,500 years, and it has evolved since the time of Buddha. This evolution is evident in places like Sri Lanka, a Theravada Buddhist country, where the annual water-cutting ceremony takes place. This ceremony, involving both monks and laypeople, holds religious significance despite not being directly taught by Buddha. Changes in Buddhism range from surface-level traditions to the fundamental beliefs about salvation. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community, including both monastic and lay members, has had to adapt its principles due to various influences. These influences can be external or internal and can be either harmful or neutral. \n\nIn this discussion, several key terms will be used frequently. \"Internal\" forces originate within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic status, while \"external\" forces come from non-Buddhists. A \"hostile\" force is one that harms or intends to harm the Buddhist community due to negative views of Buddhism. A \"benign\" force neither aims to harm nor help the community but may inadvertently do one or the other. These terms will be referenced repeatedly.\n\nInitially, it's crucial to understand the fundamentals of the religion—the core doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma primarily comprises the Tripitaka, or the three baskets, of Buddhist writings. The Sutta Pitaka contains the discourses, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the monastic rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka includes the philosophical aspects of Buddhism. These philosophical aspects involve concepts like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (life's inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). By understanding these ideas, one can end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. Enlightenment brings an end to Sansara along with lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for life. Laypeople adhere to five precepts: not to kill, lie, steal, engage in sexual misconduct, or take intoxicants. Monks follow many more rules. The fundamental doctrinal concept in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths: first, the truth that life is suffering (Dukkha); second, that attachment causes suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture has a crucial impact on negotiations. It can be defined just as much by what it's not as by what it is and what it represents. Culture isn't uniform, nor is it a single entity. Broad statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are inherently simplistic and generalize too much. While understanding cultural generalizations can be useful, it's more beneficial for a negotiator to grasp how a culture's attitudes might influence the negotiation process. When encountering a foreign culture, one tends to relate it to their own, leading to inevitable comparisons.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset can range from studying its history to recognizing its biases. Instead of judging or trying to alter a culture, one should accept it as it is and work within its parameters, especially in negotiations, and particularly if one is negotiating from a weaker position. Similarly, if negotiating on foreign soil, respecting traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and advance the negotiation.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that culture isn't limited to national or international distinctions. Companies within a nation often have their own corporate cultures. For example, a corporate culture might prioritize long office hours or a more flexible schedule. Corporate culture can be observed in employee dress codes, communication styles (direct vs. indirect), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at all levels, while others limit it to company-approved initiatives. The differences in American corporate culture from one company to another (and even within companies across different regions and between urban and suburban areas) illustrate the diversity of thought within a societal culture. While some cultures may seem less stratified and more uniform, this similarity is often just a surface-level observation, prompting a deeper examination.\n\nUnderstanding values is even more crucial, as they explain the reasons behind a culture's behavior. If maintaining face or communal harmony is valued, a negotiator will avoid publicly embarrassing their company or superior to succeed. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that values hard bargaining won't rush to settle quickly. Considering these generalities is important before entering negotiations. However, it's beneficial for a negotiator to learn about their counterpart on a personal level to ensure effective negotiations.",
            "The statement \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God’” originates from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible and serves as the foundation for St. Anselm’s argument about God’s existence. Thomas Aquinas, another thinker we will examine, appears to share this belief. As both philosophers defend the same concept, our task is to evaluate whose argument is superior. For the sake of brevity, we will assume both are correct in their belief in the God of the Bible. Considering a different kind of God would not allow us to fairly compare their arguments, as both focus on the same specific notion of God. However, I propose that while each philosopher presents compelling points, neither offers a comprehensive foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo explore this, we will first look at St. Anselm’s basic argument. Anselm suggests that understanding through faith reveals God within oneself. He argues that because God exists in our understanding, we cannot truly imagine God’s nonexistence. Although his explanation can seem tedious and unclear, the essence is that the evidence for God is found in one’s own mind. St. Anselm advises us that truth about God resides within us, and we find it by examining what we inherently know to be true. External evidence is deemed unnecessary. This acceptance of beliefs without undeniable empirical evidence is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas proposes that God’s existence can be demonstrated solely through reason and empirical evidence, without requiring faith. This approach could aid in evangelism, a key element of Christianity, by converting new believers through logic rather than relying on their acceptance of unproven beliefs. St. Thomas outlines five logical arguments for God’s existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument shows that the need for God is logically necessary. Just as a missing puzzle piece can be identified by examining the assembled puzzle, logic allows us to infer the characteristics and existence of God without direct evidence.",
            "Authors often employ various methods to evoke specific emotions or perspectives in their readers regarding significant topics. Some of these methods prove more effective than others. In his novel, The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes numerous such techniques. Occasionally, Fitzgerald combines adjectives and nouns in unconventional ways to create a particular atmosphere around a subject. At other times, he assigns symbolic meanings to objects and uses them to achieve a similar effect. He notably applies this technique to colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald imbues colors like white/gray and red/pink with meaning, later using them to evoke specific emotions around significant objects.\n\nFitzgerald assigns a sense of uniformity to white/gray, with white symbolizing a slightly more refined and upper-class status, while gray denotes something older and more faded. He establishes this symbolism early in the novel, frequently referencing both colors. Daisy and Jordan are often depicted \"in white\" (8), and indeed, everyone seems to wear white: Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom is seen in a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only instance where white is absent is during Nick's observations of Gatsby's party: the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further solidifies the meanings of these colors by associating them with mundane, insignificant subjects: as Nick commutes to work, he travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names of Gatsby's party guests are \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's list, and Catherine's apartment is part of \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—denoting uniformity (28). He also uses white or gray to describe ordinary people or places: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) appear in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" on the train is \"gray\" (26), and the dog seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nAfter establishing these meanings for white/gray, Fitzgerald uses them to indicate insignificance or uniformity in certain contexts. This use of color symbolism begins with Daisy. After a period without notable references to these colors, Fitzgerald depicts Daisy \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" prompting readers to view Daisy as less of an individual character and more as a uniform entity, something that Gatsby yearns for (74). Fitzgerald continues using this technique with Daisy to reinforce the impression of her as a uniform element, such as mentioning the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18) and her \"white\" dress (115) before the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County boasts significant agricultural productivity due to its mild, sunny climate. The region's typical crops include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a strong demand for organic, community-supported agriculture (CSA) food in the area, with many local organizations having long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also favored. Numerous organic farms offer tours of their operations and provide opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. Such operations enable landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitats, thus facilitating recreational use and creating opportunities for farm tours and educational or profit-generating programs.\n\nWhile organic farming can tap into a potentially profitable niche market, it also offers benefits like increased biodiversity in plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemicals in soil and water. However, organic farming can be more costly than conventional farming, as it demands more labor and management to control pests, weeds, and soil fertility without chemicals. Organic farms often face higher losses compared to conventional ones, and small organic farms lack the efficiency of scale seen in larger operations. Moreover, practices that benefit wildlife, although not directly related to organic farming, may incur higher labor costs, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing, removing invasive species, and managing plant growth to create specific habitats. Therefore, there are several reasons a landowner might seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land selected for this scenario is a 160-acre parcel near Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It consists of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest, situated in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of San Diego's Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This plan, which is still under review, considers over a hundred plant and animal species, including endangered ones like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, as well as declining species like burrowing owls.\n\nHistorically, this area was inhabited by Native Americans for many centuries, and later, in the late 1800s, it was settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers. This land was once part of an original homestead patent and likely used for grazing and wood production over the decades.\n\nI chose a piece of property from a real estate website and investigated available government programs to explore options for a small farmer to reduce costs and maintain wildlife-friendly practices. As an example of what someone farming this land might aim to achieve, I identified an organic farm in the same vicinity.",
            "There exists a unique connection between brothers—an unbreakable and enduring bond. This connection encompasses a spectrum of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers have a profound understanding of each other, unmatched by any other relationship, and often see a reflection of themselves in one another. In moments of crisis, the true essence of this bond becomes evident, whether positive or negative. When these emotions surface, they come with significant consequences. Understanding the emotions that arise from this fraternal bond involves facing the repercussions they entail. Seeing oneself in a brother's eyes reveals one's true self, not as others perceive, but as they truly are. The real character is revealed through actions and their outcomes. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is explored by two brothers, alongside the intense emotions that accompany it. Against a backdrop of a rich and vividly depicted setting, these boys embark on a futile quest. The story reaches its climax as bitter disappointment clashes with immense pride, leaving only one brother alive. The theme is conveyed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, their interactions, and the narrator's perspective, which reveals the protagonist's complex feelings and worldview, both of which heavily influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single dominant emotion: pride. From the moment he and his younger brother, Doodle, venture out together to their final, ill-fated journey, he harbors resentment toward Doodle. He desired a brother with whom he could share his worldly skills, such as \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He longed for a companion to \"race to Horsehead Landing...and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn...\" These aspirations were unattainable due to Doodle's condition. Doodle was born with a severely weak heart, making his survival unlikely and vigorous physical activity nearly impossible. This realization was a harsh blow to the protagonist, whose dreams were dashed. At one point, he even harbored anger towards the fragile child, contemplating suffocating him with a pillow. What child would consider such an act? However, his heart softened when the small child smiled at him, an act that gave the protagonist hope. This indicates that his resolve was likely not strong, as he had an inherent love for his brother deep down.",
            "The human brain is a complex and inventive system for processing information. As technology has evolved from simple to advanced, so too have the metaphors for describing the brain. It was initially likened to a wax tablet, then a papyrus sheet, later a book, and now a computer. When learning about the brain, it's important to remember that these metaphors have limitations and can lead to misunderstandings.  \nInformation processing begins with sensory input, where physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound, or light rays are converted into electrochemical signals by sensory organs. The brain's algorithms continually transform this sensory information through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines basic details like color, orientation, and object borders—where color shifts abruptly—to determine that a box is present. Top-down processing then uses decisions from the bottom-up process to expedite the recognition of the box, such as identifying it as a black box instead of a box-like hole in the white.  \nAfter some degree of processing, an attention filter assesses the signal's significance and determines which cognitive processes should access it. For example, your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, but a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing each one individually. Conversely, you might notice your name being spoken even in a loud room. Processing occurs in multiple stages, with attention continuously modulating the results.  \nFor the brain to process information, it must first store it. Memory comes in various forms, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, with specific encoding types for different sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input might be encoded structurally (appearance of the word), phonemically (sound of the word), or semantically (meaning of the word). Once stored, information needs to be maintained. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which retains information for about 20 seconds, is maintained by electrical signals looping through specific neurons briefly. Long-term memory is thought to be preserved in the structure of certain proteins.  \nThere are many models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on human memory retrieval, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented as nodes, connected based on their relationships. For instance, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which could then link to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a devastating financial crisis. Unemployment rose, the housing market collapsed, and numerous major corporations were left in disarray. This recession continues today, prompting us to question: what caused this crisis, and how can it be prevented? Essentially, the crisis was triggered by shortsighted and selfish political decisions that coerced banks and firms into granting sub-prime loans within an already fragile financial system. At the same time, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were urged to underwrite and bundle these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves and the turmoil spread to the repackaged mortgages they had sold, and eventually, to the larger economy.\n\nThe origins of the financial crisis trace back to 1999 during the Clinton administration, as the President sought to secure a second term by boosting his popularity. The Clinton administration achieved this by easing lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under growing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income individuals and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its impressive profit growth.\" Holmes accurately predicted the outcome: \"But the government-backed corporation may face difficulties in an economic downturn, leading to a government bailout similar to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.\" As discussed earlier, and as Holmes predicted, such reckless lending inevitably led to economic collapse.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic downturn, one being the new, intricate mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were heavily utilized leading up to the crisis, further entangling various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This caused U.S. households and financial markets to overextend themselves in the housing sector, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that invested in these mortgage-backed securities suffered. The five leading U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, amounting to about 30% of the USA's GDP. Ultimately, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at very low prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to become commercial banks subject to stringent regulations. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac held $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That part of your story where you spread your creative wings and captivate everyone with your engaging, even enchanting, writing. Or, alternatively, the part where your readers might doze off or click away, muttering your name in frustration. Dr. Merlin has been known to yell at her screen when she finds herself amid an overload of information, and not in an entertaining way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy kind readers are already familiar with the basic writing advice, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still encounters lengthy text where nothing happens, or too much does. Exposition is like the mischievous imp on your shoulder urging you to lay out the backstory to get to the exciting parts (distinct from the other imp encouraging you to detail every character's childhood).\n\nExposition involves telling the audience what occurred, usually in straightforward prose. In movies, it happens when a character provides a data dump, reminiscent of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing this telling.\n\nLet's consider an example. As you're reading a story, you're informed that the heroine met her beloved at a specific time and place, they had a grand wedding, and her husband was killed before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this whole sequence to span two pages, with each getting only two lines of dialogue. You'd anticipate the author to delve into the husband's character, showing through his words and actions how much he loves his wife, and similarly, you'd expect the heroine to demonstrate, in various ways, how his presence transformed and enriched her life (especially if the story later states this directly). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally invested in his fate and provide insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, the depth of their connection, hints about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams reflected through his perspective, and so on. You would grieve his death with her, thereby deepening your connection to the heroine.\n\nIn essence, you'd expect substance on the simple framework of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that substance. (*looks at the metaphor, sighs, continues anyway*) Sometimes, it's tempting to gloss over certain details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character, and you know he was in the Air Force, now works as a night manager at a gas station, was married twice with no kids, enjoys weekend fishing, secretly dreams of owning the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first was NBC 4's live broadcast this morning (August 13, 2011). The main story involved a man from Ashley, Ohio, named Shad Hostettler, who had stabbed his wife. Although they didn't mention her name, they did show his mugshot and described him as looking menacing. The story was brief, lasting about two minutes, as it was still unfolding. The details given were that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I felt they allocated an appropriate amount of time to this report.\n\nThe second story covered an early morning shooting of an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area, leaving him critically injured. There were no arrests or suspects at the time, and the SWAT Team was investigating. This story was also short, possibly because it involved a \"black\" man or took place in a black neighborhood. I've noticed over the years that crimes involving minorities are often overlooked. If a \"white\" child or adult is kidnapped or becomes a crime victim, the media gives extensive coverage, but minority cases might not even be mentioned.\n\nAnother report was about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They shared details on where the incident likely occurred and identified the bullet as a .22 caliber from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThe next segment was about the predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to remain in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. The weather coverage was brief, likely intended as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nThey also covered a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie, about six feet tall and weighing around 150 pounds. I felt they spent an excessive amount of time emphasizing his skin color and how dark he was.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He was found guilty of conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, they stated his sentence as \"300 months\" instead of 25 years, possibly to make it sound harsher. They also mentioned his Hispanic ethnicity, which I didn't think was relevant to the story.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of security that aims to replicate the performance of an index, commodity, or collection of assets, similar to an index fund. However, it is more adaptable, as it can be traded like a stock on an exchange. An ETF offers the diversification advantages of an index fund along with the perks of single stock ownership, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase even just one share per transaction. These appealing benefits come with the added advantage of lower expense ratios compared to the typical mutual fund. Nonetheless, there are drawbacks, such as the need to pay a commission for ETF trades, just as you would for stock trades. Another advantage of ETFs is the wide range of funds available. Despite these stated benefits, it's wise for a prudent investor to assess whether these benefits, like diversification, genuinely exist and to what degree. In this analysis, we will focus on the ETF IHF, comparing it to its top 10 holdings to see if the advantages of owning a single ETF match those of holding a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, or if there are better configurations of the same stocks that offer a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo evaluate the ETF, we will focus on just the top ten holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets, as including every holding would be cumbersome. Below are the top 10 holdings and their percentage of total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use their current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate each stock's contribution to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consists entirely of these ten stocks in the proportions set by the ETF's holdings. The Beta and return calculations are shown in the chart below.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings has a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta for the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the entire ETF. These findings suggest that a portfolio limited to the top 10 holdings could yield a higher return with a lower beta. However, it's possible that the means of these two portfolios might not be statistically different.\n\nTo determine if these portfolios are statistically different, we calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalize them to 100%, and compare their cumulative standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, there was a steep decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project, which was somewhat discouraging, and it's unclear why this occurred. The arrival of winter at a New England campus likely led to fewer people commuting by bicycle or on foot, contributing to the decline. Additionally, December is the end of the fall semester, when people are busy completing schoolwork and grading, possibly causing the commuter log to be overlooked. Moreover, December marks the start of the hectic holiday season and a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many are not required to visit the campus. Classes resume in late January for the spring semester, which may also explain the low number of logs for that month. However, this doesn't fully account for the low submissions in February. It's possible that any project like this experiences initial enthusiasm that wanes over time. To counteract this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign that successfully increased log submissions that month. Thus, a key challenge was maintaining project momentum despite a natural decline in engagement and the specific issues of holiday and semester breaks in higher education. Another challenge for this project, or any alternative commuting project, is that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars, which is deeply rooted in our culture. Therefore, providing incentives for alternative commuting is crucial. We offered many prizes, such as gift certificates to local eateries, coffee shops, massage therapists, an independent bookstore, and some larger national chains. It would have been interesting to see how offering larger prizes, like a bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car, might have influenced participation and helped address the dip in engagement. The prizes remained the same throughout the project, but increasing their value over time might have been beneficial. While the gift cards were sufficient at the project's start, announcing the addition of a few bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January might have boosted participation and engagement instead of seeing a decrease.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress’s collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films typically utilize creative editing to create illusions. My analysis primarily focused on detailing the stylistic elements prevalent in most trick films and identifying unique features in some later films. Generally, trick films from this period are confined to a set, shot within a frontal proscenium without any camera movement, relying on long and medium shots, and following a strict one shot = one film approach. However, a few films from the early 1900s deviate from these norms by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA key characteristic shared by these trick films is their filming on an interior set within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remains stationary, not following any figures or objects. This composition was typical in early films, influenced by theater and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. Due to this stage-like setup, movement in trick films is mostly lateral, with figures rarely moving towards or away from the camera. For instance, in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), actors enter from the right and move horizontally, but the camera does not track them when they exit the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also means that shots are predominantly long shots, with medium shots being less common, and close-ups never used in any Edison trick films. This mirrors the theater and vaudeville tradition, where the audience views the entire performance within the stage’s borders. Like many early films, actors remain in the middle ground, and close-ups are absent.\n\nTypically, early trick films adhere to the concept that one conceptual shot constitutes a film, limiting their duration to around a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. This also restricts the dramatic or narrative potential of trick films, which mostly showcase short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts, with minimal storytelling. However, in trick films, a single conceptual shot for the viewer might actually be a composite of several shots creating the illusion of appearance or disappearance. For instance, in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), a closer look reveals the point where the shot with Mary’s \"severed head\" starts, despite the entire film being perceived as one continuous shot by the viewer.",
            "Ian Watt characterizes the traditional \"Gothic Novel\" as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" in his work, The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic style has been both criticized and praised, accused of lacking depth yet admired for its 'terrible sublime' quality, as Burke notes. The first \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, blended elements from both \"ancient and modern\" romances to establish the proto-Gothic genre, offering a new literary expression. Walpole combines \"old\" theatrical elements with 'new' imitations of nature found in 'modern' novels to craft what he calls \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). This genre draws heavily from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even during the time The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" was applied to various peoples, styles, and eras, often seen as outdated or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" societal and literary \"progress.\" The merger of theatrical \"Gothic\" elements with the novel's new format, which provided a more personal insight into character psychology, contributed to the Gothic's enduring appeal, making it simultaneously obsolete and fresh to readers far removed from its original creation.\n\nA key Gothic concept in these novels is Chivalry. The medieval notion of chivalry, the training of a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is significant to Gothic authors because it symbolizes the ideal knight—brave, honorable, competent—and reflects the perceived absence of such ideals in society, a concern of writers like Walpole. By incorporating chivalric themes and manners, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized (foreshadowing the Gothic's evolution into Romanticism) to attempt to better the present. When writing The Castle of Otranto, Walpole was experiencing political turmoil and was disillusioned about the future. Engulfed in politics and possibly unjust accusations, he might have begun, perhaps subconsciously, to believe that the moral integrity and innate \"goodness\" of people from the gothic era had been lost in contemporary society. This notion is evident in several characters, including Frederic. Before meeting Frederic, the reader learns he embodies many chivalric qualities, described as:\n\nFrederic's portrayal includes numerous traditional chivalric images; he is primarily a prince who has endured hardship, suffered tragedy, and is thought to have been killed by infidels. The \"gallant and courteous Knight\" figure is exaggerated, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves a series of processes that move goods from the point of a customer's order through stages such as raw materials, supply, production, and distribution until they reach the customer. The concept of supply chain management was introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who defined it as the comprehensive process of planning, executing, and controlling supply chain operations to efficiently meet customer needs. There are six critical components of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to deliver optimal customer service.  \nProduction is the initial phase in the supply chain and serves as its cornerstone. This stage determines the timing, reasons, locations, and methods of production. Managers must understand customer preferences, which can be assessed by analyzing the market, the primary indicator of customer demand. Once managers comprehend market demands, they can decide on the products to manufacture and their quantities. Following these decisions, the next step is to determine the most suitable production facility, considering both volume and quality to meet customer satisfaction. After selecting the production site, managers focus on scheduling tasks and maintaining equipment. Production is a crucial element of the supply chain, where attention to detail is essential. Poor planning can result in significant time and financial losses for a company. For instance, in my experience working at Wal-Mart and Target, both retailers utilize structured guidelines and procedures for every business aspect, from employee uniforms to shipment reception. Such structured processes help companies operate efficiently, minimizing confusion and clarifying expectations.  \nThe second essential component of supply chain management is supply. Supply involves strategic decisions aimed at defining the core capabilities of a facility, with outsourcing partnerships developing from these decisions. A company might have various production divisions for a single product, each with different equipment, personnel, and expertise. Managers must determine which division best suits the different production processes. Additionally, management might opt to outsource work to other firms. The primary motivation for outsourcing is to enhance velocity, which is the ability to deliver quality and flexibility while keeping costs low or stable.",
            "Victorian novels are notable for their detailed descriptions and focus on the period's aristocracy. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights are two Victorian novels that diverge from this norm. These novels incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, which are uncommon in works from that era, enhancing the depth of their characters by offering insights into their motives and emotions.\n\n\"And now, a flood of bewildering and confusing thoughts crowded his mind. He felt as if he were still walking with Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily arguing, for he could hear their words; and when he focused on himself, he realized he was speaking to them. Suddenly, he was startled by the sound of gunfire, loud cries and shouts filled the air; lights flashed before his eyes, and everything was chaotic, as an unseen hand hurriedly carried him away. Amid these rapid visions, there was a vague, uneasy sense of pain that constantly tormented him.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nThe two novels frequently use mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and purpose differ in each instance. In Oliver Twist, these peculiar occurrences often reveal insights into Oliver's deeper layers, his struggles, and his understanding of the reality around him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he vividly relives it as if in a dream while trying to find help. This passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the events and the dire state of his health, which is evident in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing his senses, and he doesn't notice the \"unseen hand\" that carries him away; he re-experiences his despair, detached from the initial shock, as the pain is now constant and linked with fear instead of surprise. This overwhelming situation raises questions about who is responsible for his misfortune since it is certainly not Oliver himself. The shooting underscores Oliver's lack of control over his circumstances, as he cannot even attempt to influence the outcome of the events, even when his life is at risk. This selection implies a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, suggesting that old Fagin has begun to break him, pushing him into accepting despair and affecting his ability to react. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of his own life.\n\n\"The day passed – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as it arrived – and night came again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years back, I worked in an after-school program where I tutored elementary students. I aimed to assist them with any subjects they found difficult, although my expertise was in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to help a young boy named Adrian, who was in the third or fourth grade and struggling significantly with reading. I noticed something unusual about his difficulties; he could pronounce some letters perfectly while others were completely off, which was quite odd. Although Adrian was of Latino descent, he spoke flawless English. We continued having challenges until I met his mother. I was supervising a few kids who stayed behind while the rest went on a field trip when she came in. She didn’t speak English, only Spanish. Using my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate. That’s when I realized the issue: Adrian could read well, but he was unfamiliar with the English alphabet. I’m not sure if my discovery helped him much, but I hope he’s doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issue in schools, particularly in California. It also illustrates that the problem isn’t always obvious. Even a child who speaks perfect English can face significant reading challenges. Acknowledging that this issue exists is easy, but what do we do about it? For Adrian, the solution was straightforward: English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children who barely speak English, the solution is more complex. There isn't a single answer. A combination of dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes is necessary.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is beneficial, not only for children whose first language is Spanish but for all children. Studies show that children in bilingual programs often outperform their peers academically. There’s a lot of fear that this approach wastes resources and doesn’t benefit most students, but that’s incorrect. If these programs were standard rather than exceptions, all students would gain from them. But how do we implement this? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that would be unreasonable and somewhat unrealistic. However, there's no reason we can’t have special aides or tutors who are bilingual.",
            "From a young age, many of us are taught that there is something greater than ourselves, beyond our understanding. Some attend Sunday school to learn about it, others go to Temple, or seek answers within themselves. Many of us adopt the religions passed down by our parents, while some of us completely reject them, denying the existence of anything beyond our own egocentric world. We might embrace one set of beliefs, only to later change them for another. Whatever path we take, we strive to define a part of ourselves through our own spiritual perspectives. We search for guidance to lead us out of darkness and into the light.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father replied when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on our front porch, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof as we smoked together. The gutters spilled rainwater, drowning the plants along the porch's edge. He stared into the rain, a look that seemed part searching, part reminiscing. Over the past few months, he'd grown thinner, his clothes hanging loosely, and his hair was sparser than I remembered. He continued to gaze into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, scared, unable to express to him how much I would miss him, as speaking of it would make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer, and joined him in watching the rain fall in the June twilight.\n\nMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation hadn't eased his suffering but had prolonged his life a few months beyond the doctors' predictions; I couldn't see the value in just extending his pain. I wondered what kind of God would allow this. Alone in the night, I offered no prayers. If God existed, I felt He had long since stopped listening to me.\n\nI didn't want to witness him transition from this life to another. So I didn't. I couldn't bear to watch the end of the life that gave me life. I wanted to remember him for how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than anyone, better than his family, and I knew he wouldn't want his only child to witness his death. I stayed curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an enthusiastic early advocate of Republicanism. Although primarily a farmer, his profession, along with his short political career, made him known for his commitment to and outspoken views on personal freedom and government. His support for an agrarian system formed the foundation of nearly all his governmental opinions. His efforts to preserve and promote what he saw as the most esteemed career influenced his views on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the judicial system.  \nTaylor believed that the United States had a significant opportunity to establish an ideal system because there was no existing native tradition to constrain the government’s founders, allowing them to create a system of self-governance. He was a strong believer in the natural rights of individuals and argued that these rights are interconnected—if one is denied, they all fail, diminishing the value of those that remain. Therefore, these rights should be protected from government interference. He argued that what some referred to as the \"state of nature\" was a scenario where those with physical strength and malicious intelligence thrived, but this should not be the case in a civilized society.  \nTo build this ideal society, Taylor believed a government must be established that acknowledges the inherent good and evil within humans. Taylor held firm views on dualistic morality, asserting that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalism, and argued that a government founded on good principles would operate fairly, despite being led by greed and self-interest. He believed self-interest motivated all human actions but was only deemed evil when it extended beyond creating a society focused on the public good to forming sub-societies that exploited others. A good government was necessary to contain humanity's inherent evil, and it must be carefully monitored to prevent the introduction of bad principles.  \nTaylor, like many staunch Republicans of his era, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He desired a highly limited Federal government, with no more rights or powers than those explicitly granted in the Constitution. He understood that a large Federal government was costly and prone to despotism. However, he also believed that a simple, literal interpretation was risky and could easily become corrupt without considering the writers' intentions. Moreover, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defined the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind processing the scene before me with a detached clarity. Without any emotional involvement, I observed with a practiced focus that refused to connect the object of my observation to any abstract concepts. My thoughts came and went almost instantly, flowing so seamlessly that it seemed as though I had no real thoughts of my own—just a fluid experience of what I was viewing.\n\nOnce, following advice from an artist I collaborated with, I bought an instructional book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had aspired to draw since I was six, and this book covered everything from understanding a pencil to the brain's methods for interpreting lines. One method it taught was to place a square frame around any image the artist wanted to study, transforming a complex scene, like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room, into a manageable picture of just the bowl of fruit on a simple surface.\n\nAt that moment, as I looked down at the bowl before me, I couldn't mentally apply that artist's frame. Overwhelmed and in awe, I could only stand and marvel. Picasso had his blue period, Monet admired greenery, and Italian Renaissance artists displayed a spectrum of colors. If I had any notions of my perspective being artistically valuable, then in front of me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers touched my chosen tool of creativity. Muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand moved through space, transforming my mind's intention into what might have been the most imaginative moment of my life. Water swirled, calm and clear. Flakes of matter detached and drifted away. Muscles tightened, and with a bit more urgency, my hand slapped the toilet handle again. The stubborn brown mass remained, stuck like a slug at the bottom of the toilet.\n\nMop loosely in hand, feet spaced a foot apart, and a green tie uncomfortably knotted around my neck, I frowned slightly at the offensive bundle of processed matter someone had left as a message for those who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid. After a few more flushes and some tranquil, introspective moments, my hand reached for the toilet paper, wrapping itself until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand slowly dipped into the bowl, like a mother reaching into the oven for the Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "Teen drivers are losing their lives in car accidents. Various factors contribute to this alarming trend among America's youngest drivers. According to the National Institutes of Health, a significant issue is that teenagers' brains are not fully equipped to handle driving hazards. Their lack of experience is another core problem, leading not only to more fatal crashes but also to increased incidents of rollovers, speeding, and losing control of the vehicle. Additionally, teenagers are at greater risk when driving with their peers, a common occurrence. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has found a link between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents.\n\nTo improve teen driver safety, states like California have implemented temporary provisional licenses that impose restrictions on driving hours and passenger limits for minors. However, I believe these provisional licenses are merely temporary solutions. The fundamental issue is that young drivers, as a demographic, are statistically unprepared to manage the inherent risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even at age 18, individuals may be too young for a standard driver's license. USA Today highlights Zuckerman's research, which suggests that people under 19-20 have a propensity for thrill-seeking. Therefore, it might be prudent to delay driving until this tendency diminishes. If we continue to license young teens, fatal accidents will persist, and the death toll could rise dramatically in the coming years, especially as the children of Baby Boomers become eligible to drive by 2010, increasing the number of teen drivers on the roads.\n\nAddressing this issue through legislation could be relatively simple. Schools could still offer driver's education to prepare future drivers, but no one under 18 should be allowed to drive. Provisional permits could still be issued before a full license, with a requirement for a specific number of practical driving hours, similar to current state requirements, such as California's six hours of driving instruction and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Given that the troubling statistics for teen drivers are consistent across states, a uniform national law could be a sensible and effective way to protect teens nationwide. The legislative approach I propose is not new.",
            "This paper explores three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with a concise definition of the disorder, followed by an explanation of its diagnosis, highlighting key characteristics or \"red flags.\" The paper concludes with strategies that teachers in mainstream classrooms can use to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), involves the central nervous system's (CNS) ability to process auditory information efficiently and effectively. More specifically, (C)APD pertains to the perceptual processing of sounds within the CNS and the neurobiological activity that supports this processing, leading to electrophysiological auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it is a condition where the brain struggles to properly process auditory information. Individuals with CAPD have normal hearing and are not classified as \"hearing impaired\"; instead, the brain region responsible for interpreting what is heard, such as differentiating words or distinguishing conversation from background noise, does not function as it should.\n\nThe first reference to the disorder later known as CAPD dates back to the mid-1950s, initially termed \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), during research on children with communication disorders. In 1954, the Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started developing tests for these children. By 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the physiology of the central auditory nervous system (CANS) underlying dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 further stimulated research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways, including difficulty localizing or hearing sounds in space, distinguishing between multiple acoustic events, recognizing sound patterns, detecting changes in speech (such as sarcasm), experiencing sound masking, synthesizing auditory clues into meaningful actions, and determining the sequence of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves screening the patient through \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,\" which can be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals using various measures to evaluate auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This process may include questionnaires, surveys, and observations of auditory behavior, assessing how the patient responds to specific stimuli. Currently, no single tool or test consistently achieves a high diagnostic success rate, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Many tests involve presenting the patient with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and asking them to differentiate certain items, such as a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to those signals.",
            "In my pursuit of a social work education, I aim to build a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on aiding children who have suffered abuse or neglect and offering support to families in crisis. The values I bring to social work include service, respect, ethics, a commitment to fostering better relationships among people, and a dedication to professional self-improvement to maintain competence. These values are not only crucial to social workers but are also personally significant to me.\n\nI have always been driven to help others, though I was initially uncertain about which career path to take. During high school and college, I noticed many people avoiding their problems or resorting to unhealthy coping methods. These observations led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. However, still unsure about my career direction, I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, a visit to a friend introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy on her couch, who was there to escape his abusive parents. The following day, I learned he had contacted the police regarding his situation. Eager to assist, I visited his parents’ home, expressed my concerns to the police, and mentioned my recent Psychology degree. The police asked me to speak with the parents, as the law offered no solution for the teenager. When I confronted the parents, they appeared uneasy and offered excuses for their son's \"manipulative\" behavior in seeking outside help for \"simple\" family disputes. This experience prompted me to seriously consider a career in social work to aid children facing such \"simple\" family conflicts.\n\nAnother crucial value in social work is social justice. Society often emphasizes the importance of the individual and mourns those lost, yet clings to outdated traditions rather than true individuality. If we mourn lost individuals, why do we strive for conformity? I embrace my individuality and resist limiting myself to fit in. Throughout high school and college, I actively protested against social injustice, whether it was through expressing myself with bold hair colors, wearing clothes that reflected my personality, getting multiple ear piercings, joining the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), or speaking out against racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. I firmly believe in social justice and will continue to oppose social injustice.",
            "This paper examines the Biological and Sociocultural models concerning the disorder insomnia. The biological model emphasizes inherited genetic information and medical health aspects. In contrast, the Sociocultural models consider environmental relationships and their relevance to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The review of insomnia explores these models, discussing each selected study to enhance understanding of the models. The research explanations and findings are critiqued for their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified as primary sleep disorders, those related to another mental disorder, or those linked to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while sleep disorders associated with another mental disorder relate to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorder categories may result from medical conditions or substance use. Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in achieving or maintaining sleep, whereas Primary Hypersomnia involves trouble staying awake, both persisting for at least a month. Narcolepsy is characterized by cataplexy and/or automatic REM. Dyssomnias focus on sleep initiation and maintenance, while Parasomnias involve behavioral or physiological abnormalities during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep issues due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily focuses on insomnia and, to some extent, primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genes, heritable factors, and physiological aspects related to sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study conducted on mice revealed that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are responsible for sleep/wake states. Activating the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep, and inhibiting it can reduce anxiety and promote sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) was found to increase sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that mouse models can be extrapolated to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A malfunction or absence of this receptor could impair the ability to achieve adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication is that if the phenotype is inherited, it may regulate sleep, and any alteration in the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep, adversely affecting aspects of life such as education, career, and daily activities requiring focus and monotony.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for roughly two and a half years, equating to four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many, myself included. During my freshman year, I lived in a dorm in East Halls, which is essentially the farthest eastern point of the campus, aside from the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard building, located near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes, especially in the frequently bad weather typical of State College. An alum I spoke to, not much older than myself, mentioned that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the university by large expanses of unused land. Now, that space is occupied by sports fields, large new buildings such as the new Creamery and health services building, and is surrounded by apartments. As our campus continues to grow, moving from one area to another becomes increasingly difficult. What’s the best solution to the mobility issue? On a college campus, it's the bicycle. But simply having bikes isn't enough; students need to use them, and the campus should be designed to accommodate cyclists.\n\nI spoke with a friend who recently started biking again after several years. He expressed surprise at why he ever stopped, saying, \"Bikes are great. For a while, it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” Bicycling not only benefits your health but is also the most efficient mode of travel. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical effort can cover 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off-campus, about as far from the campus center as some dorms. The smartest decision I made this year was to purchase a bike. I have a class in the Thomas building every day, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. Biking can reduce that time to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. The only issue is that Pollock Road is the most direct route to the Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, whether on a bike or on foot. Walking has its merits, but I'm too busy for it. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable means to reach class. Walking to Thomas every day would consume an extra 30-40 minutes of my day, totaling over two and a half hours each week. Adding in the time spent walking to other classes and appointments, that's more time than I can afford.",
            "In \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley criticizes the looming dangers of technology and the capitalist systems that support it by depicting a dystopian society. In this world, people prioritize community over individuality and are conditioned from birth to seek immediate gratification above all else. The citizens are mere pawns in a larger scheme, bound to a single ideology as determined by the World Controller. Through a Marxist lens, one can discern Huxley's skepticism towards the development of these systems. Marxist terms such as homogeny and reification underscore the notion that Huxley's novel critiques the shortcomings of the emerging economy of his era. \n\nCapitalism is critiqued through the Marxist concept of false consciousness. Essentially, ordinary citizens are prevented from understanding their true economic relationships with other classes, as they are focused solely on their own benefits. This is attributed to the ideological control over the proletariat and common workers, clearly demonstrated by the conditioning of people in \"Brave New World.\" The lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, lack true autonomy; through hypnopaedia, the urge to consume, spend, and indulge is prioritized above all else. This manipulation is orchestrated by the World Controller. Hegemony, the idea that social classes are dominated entirely by another group, is evident here. The lower classes remain unaware of their manipulation, quite literally 'buying into an ideology that supports that structure' (i.e., capitalism and consumerism). The upper classes have the capacity to recognize this manipulation but remain passive; few Alphas or Betas, beyond characters like Bernard, challenge their roles. The interactions between social classes, as further discussed, highlight the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" genuine relationships between individuals are absent. The novel seemingly does not differentiate characters, even among main figures, who lack depth. Huxley may be implying that the combination of technological and capitalist advances strips individuals of their free will and self-expression. Love and emotional extremes are nonexistent; interactions are superficial, notably reflected in how men discuss women primarily based on their physical attributes (such as their 'pneumatic' quality), and how women openly comment on their encounters. Additionally, each societal class's contentment with their hierarchical status reflects the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their unwavering compliance with their societal roles highlights Marxist views on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform with their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in an Islam course at CBC. A significant topic that sparked intense debate in the class was whether Islam is inherently hostile. I feel this question is even more pertinent today than it was in the past. Reflecting on the events since 9/11, I've noticed a shift in the media's portrayal of Islam, from a hostile perspective towards extremists to a more tolerant stance regarding Islam in America. Back in 2001, it seemed unlikely that a presidential candidate with a name like Barack Obama, who has evident Muslim heritage in his family, could emerge.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet fascinates me because, based on my understanding of Muhammad's history, it seems to contradict his character. From what I previously knew, I believed Muhammad compelled people to convert to Islam, conquering tribes and imposing the religion on them. However, the biography portrays Muhammad as a martyr who was misunderstood and demonstrated humility to others, leading people to gradually recognize the 'truth' in his teachings and seek him out.\n\nFurthermore, there are striking similarities between Jesus' ministry and the 'miracles' attributed to Muhammad. One notable instance is when Muhammad supposedly multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men. This narrative style suggests that the authors aimed to depict Muhammad as a humble prophet who lived truthfully and performed miracles without needing to prove himself. I find this problematic as it diminishes the miracles and life of Jesus Christ, as if they are trying to attribute Jesus' significance to Muhammad.\n\nAdditionally, many stories in the biography appear to serve an agenda of demonstrating how people converted to Islam 'on their own.' However, these accounts are often relayed from a third-party perspective, such as hearing from someone who heard from another, and so on. This approach, intended to validate the stories, instead made them seem less credible and more suspicious to me.\n\nWhat troubles me most about the work is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure—humble, wise, and gentle. Yet, historical accounts contradict the notion of Muhammad being gentle and humble, and I wonder if contemporary Muslims are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's ascent to power.",
            "The core teachings and beliefs of Jesus during his lifetime were quickly set aside as Christian thought evolved after his death. Observing this historical trajectory, it becomes evident that Christianity has gradually drifted away from its original roots. In today's world, there is a growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive attitude. While traditionalists exist and will resist any thinking beyond what they have been taught, they may not have enough influence to sway the entire population. Among Christians, awareness of history is expected to expand significantly in the coming years, sparking a desire to differentiate the doctrines added over time from the true intentions of Jesus. Although it may take decades or even centuries, the outcome seems inevitable: a significant reversal in the trend of Christian history, moving back to its original form. A movement will emerge, gradually peeling away layers of doctrine as if time were reversing, until only the essence of what Jesus introduced to humanity remains, before other thinkers made their claims. As this trend spreads across the United States and Europe, influencing many to practice faith as if they were living in Jesus' time, following only his teachings, the church as an institution will remain strong to guide the way. However, with the theological clock moving backward, the current diversity within Christianity will give way to increasing uniformity in belief and practice. Differences between regions, denominations, and divisions will diminish, resulting in greater similarities. Human history is marked by significant reversals, such as when Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, which later became a Christian institution. Our country has transitioned from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The forthcoming great reversion will unfold within the realm of Christianity, seeking to return to its origins and reducing diversity in the process. A crucial element in this transformation will be interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically rather than literally. So, what has transpired since Jesus' time? Looking far back into history reveals only Judaism, the theological precursor to Christianity. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the concept of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were central to the faith. However, the Jewish population was not unified, dividing into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I think that \"The Jungle\" illustrates how people are inherently greedy and self-serving. They focus solely on improving their own lives without considering those beneath them. This is evident throughout the book, particularly in the behavior of the factory owners and managers. They prioritize expanding their businesses, with no concern for the people or things harmed in the process. Upton Sinclair's narrative describes the destructive impact of pollution, highlighting the owners' disregard for human and animal welfare. They overlook the smoke pouring from the factories and the waste from the livestock pens in Packingtown.\n\nFurthermore, the owners and managers show little concern for their workers, who toil to make them wealthy. They exploit their employees to maximize profits, with \"a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds\" prevailing throughout the workplace, where financial gain takes precedence over human value. Workers endure long hours and face sudden mass layoffs without compensation or job placement assistance. During the time period depicted in \"The Jungle,\" there were few, if any, laws ensuring worker safety and wellbeing, allowing for rampant exploitation and poor working conditions. Although the book doesn't explicitly state it, those who lived and worked in Packingtown were expected to endure the harsh realities both on the job and in their living environments, with no support from agencies or organizations. While unions existed, they often exploited the workers instead of aiding them. The dire treatment and lack of escape from Packingtown's system left workers akin to slaves, described as a \"low-class and mostly foreign\" population teetering on starvation, reliant on ruthless management reminiscent of slave drivers. Under such conditions, immorality was as prevalent and inevitable as in the era of chattel slavery.",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is considered by Edgar Allan Poe to be one of his finer poems. In this work, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which scholar Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil mentioned Thulé as an island located north of Britain, regarded by the Greeks as the boundary of the known world. While Virgil indeed used the term, there is a more contemporary source that deserves acknowledgment. Poe had a keen interest in German authors. This connection is significant as it highlights Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" notes the similarities between their poems, suggesting that Poe was imitating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned writer of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe’s death. Within the second part of \"Faust\" is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells of a king whose wife dies after gifting him a goblet. In mourning, he drinks heavily and cries over his lost queen. Eventually, he resolves to die, giving his possessions to his children, except for the goblet, which he throws into the sea before closing his eyes and dying. The king's demeanor in \"The King of Thulé\" and the description of the king in \"Dream-Land\" are quite similar, possibly reflecting a dark mirror of Poe's own experiences with loss and drinking. \"Faust\" was also adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just before Poe's use of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe mentions Thule twice in his collected works. He references \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and uses the phrase twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be viewed as complementary pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes Thule’s landscape as dark and lonely, haunted by the memories of deceased friends, and devoid of color. These visions resonate with \"The King of Thulé,\" where the king, having lost his wife, is lonely and lacks the will to rule or live. The entire poem seems to depict the speaker stepping into Goethe’s creation.\n\nGoethe was an influential author whom Poe would have known, if only through his admiration for Tennyson. Poe expressed his respect for Tennyson and, through this connection, would have been exposed to Goethe’s work, which was widely reproduced after its original release.",
            "Under California law, a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store might be entitled to punitive damages if it can be shown that the store manager acted with malice by neglecting to clean the spill for half an hour, despite being informed twice, because he was having dinner. It's unlikely that a judge would outright dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive damages. To justify such a claim, a plaintiff must provide evidence that the defendant acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm their conduct could cause, and that the conduct was despicable. Palmer could argue that Martin should have anticipated the harm from not cleaning a spill, given that several D&D customers had previously been injured in similar incidents in the months before her accident. Despite this awareness, Martin did not address the spill. Although Palmer’s claim that Martin’s actions were despicable is less compelling, it remains plausible considering that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009, yet Martin still failed to ensure store safety.  \n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin, who was on a dinner break, dismissed the issue, saying he \"didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also informed Martin of the spill, receiving the same response. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill, suffering a severe back injury. Before Palmer’s accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been recorded at D&D’s in 2009. Palmer is suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages for her injuries, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, punitive damages can be awarded for breaches not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice\" (Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010)). The law defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm or, if not intentional, conduct that is \"despicable\" and performed with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others\" (id. at § (c)(1)). The courts have described conduct as malicious when it is carried out with a conscious disregard for the plaintiff’s rights and where the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences\" (Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979)).",
            "She had always felt a sense of longing, an unfulfilled desire that emerged when she was about 14, just starting her teenage years. This yearning persisted even three years later at 17. By then, she realized she was searching for someone, not something. However, she hadn't developed any interest in boys, despite some showing interest in her with awkward efforts to win her over. She often questioned herself about this unusual feeling, pondering what could make such a peculiar thing happen to a teenage girl. Years of reflection had produced theories, but none convincing enough for her to dwell on. So she continued living her life, constantly questioning her desires.\n\nAt home, days were usually peaceful. Her parents were calm and gentle people, rarely arguing with each other or with her. Their only disagreements were about her asserting her independence and free spirit. She was the lively daughter of a serene couple, her vibrant and fun personality making her well-liked along with her kindness.\n\nBut today wasn't peaceful. As she moved around the house searching for new inspiration, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, her mother's lovely voice. She rushed to the room, panicking as she frantically asked, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the floor, appearing to be in pain, repeatedly saying \"Ow\" with short breaths. The daughter hurried to her side, trying to help. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital,\" her mother said in rushed, strained words, indicating she was in severe pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Following her mother's guidance, she felt grateful for the strength she had gained from her classes. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the back, and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital visit was filled with the smell of disinfectant and an atmosphere of fear and illness, but she was too focused on aiding her mother to notice. She swiftly carried her injured mother inside and called for medical assistance. Several concerned faces gathered, and someone quickly brought a rolling bed to lay her mother on. They immediately took her for examination, leaving her daughter to anxiously wait.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a stepping stool while trying to reach a vase from their highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a decreased risk of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet is an adjusted version of the Med diet, characterized by increased consumption of plant foods, such as plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (in preference to saturated fats), and fish, with a reduced intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown an inverse relationship between adherence to a Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, and an intervention trial found the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, prior studies did not specifically address stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) that evaluated nutrient intake over the previous year. Over 95% of the nurses continued their participation throughout the 20-year period, and the FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed via medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, cases were deemed \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts classified as such. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of postmenopausal hormones were calculated for each FFQ, and from 1986 onwards, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo minimize individual random variation and better capture long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were computed (averaging scores from the previous two years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could obscure results) by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the relationship between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with distinct models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nA higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as shown by an elevated aMed diet score, was linked with a reduced risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up, there were 2,391 new CHD cases, 1,763 new stroke cases, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (including fatal CHD and strokes combined). Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The sign declares, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" \n\nEllen Page, known for her role in Juno, stands alone on a street corner holding a cardboard sign with this disturbing message, written in Sharpie. Burma, now called Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by an oppressive military junta that seized power in a 1962 coup. In 2007, the country witnessed its first public demonstrations in a decade, led mainly by Burmese monks. These protests became known as \"The Saffron Revolution,\" named after the monks' saffron-colored robes. Initially, the government allowed the monks to protest peacefully, but the situation soon deteriorated into what many viewed as a full-scale conflict between the monks and the military junta, with the military invading and pillaging monasteries nationwide. Foreign journalists were detained and imprisoned, with Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai being killed on September 27, 2007, simply for attending a street protest. Although the official death toll was reported as 13, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army shortly before the official announcement, claimed that \"many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is not a new phenomenon. While these examples are among the more recent atrocities in our world, the desire of governments to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over their citizens has existed throughout history. Early Roman emperors proclaimed themselves divinely chosen to have complete authority over every aspect of society. Japanese emperors were believed to be gods themselves, sent to lead their people to prosperity. Meanwhile, then-U.S. President George W. Bush reportedly had regular calls with Ted Haggard, leader of an organization for uninformed individuals, affiliated with the Republican Party.\n\nNotable historical examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to challenge authoritarian rule. The death toll from this event is disputed, with Chinese government reports stating 200-300 deaths, while the Chinese Red Cross reported 2,000-3,000. Another instance is the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s, where Hutu militias, backed by the government, systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of their ethnicity. Hitler's 'Third Reich' is another extreme case, involving the widespread persecution and execution of Jews across multiple countries.",
            "Duke Ellington's significant contribution to jazz is largely attributed to his long career and his exceptional ability to shape his orchestra creatively. While his presence at the piano is understated in many of the compositions for this assignment, as a composer, Ellington was adept at crafting intricate and layered pieces that highlighted the talents of individual band members. He designed frameworks that allowed soloists to improvise freely, alongside composing tightly orchestrated segments that leveraged the unique styles of his musicians to enhance musical concepts. In this way, he also accentuated the overall tone of the orchestra, producing cohesive and original sounds for each composition. Ellington's expertise in understanding the distinct sounds of his musicians and how they integrated within an expanding ensemble enabled him to create some of the most innovative and remarkable works in jazz history. The Grove Music dictionary, when discussing Ellington's sound and innovation, cites \"Creole Love Call\" as an example of his use of the voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This early piece illustrates Ellington's application of the voice to add texture and color without relying on lyrics. \"Creole Love Call\" also showcases Ellington's knack for complementing the style of his soloists, a skill evident throughout his career. This measured, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece consists of six choruses: Chorus 1 features a call and response between voice and reeds, transitioning from a smooth, melodic start to a rougher end. Chorus 2 has a muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the main melody, highlighting several extended blue notes. Chorus 3 includes a sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, supported by a subtle syncopated piano phrase. Chorus 4 sees the full band echoing the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections. Chorus 5 is the climactic section, with the reeds initiating the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. Chorus 6 revisits the first chorus's structure, with call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice employs the \"growl\" technique, soloing like an instrument. The piece concludes with a brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by the trombone. Ellington's use of voice to add tonal color to this piece is a stylistic hallmark throughout his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington merges his skill in tight orchestration with his sensitivity to tone color. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing blends the vocal qualities of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice, creating a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" further develops these ideas, as Ellington effectively utilizes Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a regular in Ellington's orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "What drives the evolution of organisms in specific ways? Are there limitations that shape the path of evolutionary changes? In 1917, D’Arcy Thompson remarked that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" and this statement still holds true today. Recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to understand general aspects of mollusk shell formation throughout their development and evolutionary history (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of developmental and evolutionary changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help reveal the mechanisms behind the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental changes. We used X-ray images of Prunum species to define quantitative parameters for modeling both hypothetical and real shell shapes. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We created models of potential shell shapes to explore the limits of morphological change in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a deeper understanding of major evolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be imagined as a tube that moves over time through 360 degrees of space. The turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which whorls expand can vary, with a continuous line called a suture marking each whorl. Typically, the largest whorl in a shell is the final one, known as the body whorl. The spire consists of all whorls except the last, with the apex marking the tip of the spire and the opposite end called the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The \"usual\" orientation is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.)\n\nTo count whorls, begin by viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying where the first suture starts. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell into two sections. Whorls are counted from this line and estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a sequence of apertures that progress through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced using the coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture, along with the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be depicted both graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical model is established, it is possible to adjust parameters and alter the mollusk’s shell formation process.",
            "Over the past decade, the rates of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia have remained largely unchanged. Although the nation is progressing towards several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, the improvements in child and maternal health are insufficient to reach the 2015 targets. The reasons for these deficiencies will be explored below, highlighting the necessity of enhancing the health system rather than concentrating solely on program-specific interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen progress in the number of births attended by skilled health workers, with 72% currently meeting this criterion. However, this statistic includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who cannot perform medical interventions in complicated pregnancies, which contributes to the high rate of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. Thus, the advancements in this indicator may be somewhat deceptive, indicating much work still needs to be done. Moreover, there is a decrease in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five being treated by healthcare professionals. Although data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is evident that this is also an area of concern, with low rates reported nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain below expectations at around 4%. The disparity in c-section rates—7% in urban areas compared to just 2% in rural areas—highlights a significant issue of unequal healthcare access. Clearly, healthcare services are concentrated in urban locales. Access issues also relate to vertical equity, with a 27% gap in service use between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles, suggesting that the poor have far more difficulty accessing healthcare, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn considering future strategies for improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the fundamental question is how best to address the lack of services. Should Indonesia focus on developing program-specific strategies or on strengthening the overall health system without singling out pre and postnatal care for mothers and children? While targeted programmatic approaches are appealing due to their precise, manageable goals and typically quicker results, they come with certain drawbacks. A significant downside is that concentrating resources on one health sector often leads to neglect in others, with human resources gravitating towards better-funded areas (as seen with international funding for HIV/AIDS impacting the family planning sector). Additionally, running multiple parallel programs can lead to redundant and uncoordinated services, increasing the administrative burden for supplies and funding applications.",
            "Over the last century, the classification of Popular Music has expanded so much that it is challenging to list all the genres. Adding to the complexity, nearly all genres—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—have given rise to numerous sub-genres and even sub-sub-genres. One could argue that the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has evolved into one of the most varied and expressive genres in popular music over the past 40 years. Its expressiveness comes from its broad emotional range, often leaning toward darker themes. The diversity of Heavy Metal became evident soon after its inception, as people recognized its flexibility and began creating their own sub-genres, leading to further sub-sub-genres, a trend that continues today.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal movement has diversified into so many niche groups that defining what constitutes heavy metal has become challenging. It has incorporated a wide array of themes from other genres, but, like anything else, it originated from somewhere. To truly understand the metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp what the metal movement is and why it is considered a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nIn many respects, metal is a movement characterized by darkness. It can be described as a \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more aggression, more theatricality. It is less primitive and more sophisticated; musicians in metal bands are highly skilled, and this proficiency is evident in their music. Metal is also a movement heavily influenced by drugs, particularly during the psychedelic drug surge in the mid-70s, which led to increasingly wild and other-worldly music, with drugs serving as a catalyst for creation. It possesses many dark, visceral qualities that were new to the music scene as much of popular music tended to avoid the darker emotional spectrum. Additionally, later generations of metal have drawn some inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities prominent during the Romantic Era. Lyrics like those in \"Helter Skelter\" illustrate the darkness that is central to the movement.\n\nThe lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" showcase the darker side of The Beatles, reflecting a turbulent, possibly drug-influenced journey. This song is sometimes considered one of the first Heavy Metal tracks, created in response to a Rolling Stones song with similarly heavy, dark themes. The Beatles wanted to demonstrate they could be just as intense as the Stones, so they included this song on The White Album.",
            "Several decades before the Surrealists started creating their dream-inspired art, Henri Rousseau was meticulously developing his own dreams, both in reality and in his imagination. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only depicts a woman marveling at the wonders of a dream world but also embodies Rousseau’s personal aspirations and ambitions as an artist. Since he began his artistic journey, Rousseau longed for recognition, acceptance, and acclaim from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet he grappled with a significant internal conflict to fulfill this ambition. The Dream illustrates Rousseau’s lifelong internal struggle to either conform to or imitate popular art styles to gain acceptance within the critical art community he admired, or to maintain his creative independence and forge his own path.\n\nTo fully appreciate The Dream from this perspective, one must first understand Rousseau’s background. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who experienced \"bourgeois prosperity\" (Shattuck 47). Without any formal artistic training, Rousseau worked until the age of forty in France’s municipal toll service, known as a gabelou, though he was mistakenly referred to as a douanier, or customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The loss of his first wife Clémence, following the deaths of eight infant children, left him with one surviving daughter, Julia, and deep sorrow (Shattuck 49). Seeking solace and a new beginning, Rousseau turned to painting for comfort. Unlike his contemporaries who idealized the peasant life in their art, Rousseau was fundamentally a folk painter with the aspirations common to his social class.\n\nRousseau’s intense desire for acceptance in the art world is understandable considering his circumstances: he was self-taught, started his artistic career later in life, and was creating art alongside many other renowned modern artists. Despite years of work, Rousseau only began to receive due recognition around the same time Matisse was establishing his reputation. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes that although Rousseau and Matisse were technically rivals, they differed in style, subject matter, and their motivations for painting: “Matisse feared painting in a clichéd manner, while Rousseau aspired to create art so conventional he would gain entry to the Artiste Français” (92).",
            "Numerous prominent thinkers have suggested a deep link between ethics and aesthetics, as well as between truth and beauty. I think there is a fundamental reason for this connection. As John Keats expresses in “Ode on a Grecian Urn,” “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of our knowledge comes from education or experience, but we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics naturally, as Keats hints, without formal teaching. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than dictate. Our exploration of morality and beauty primarily seeks to explain why a piece of art or literature is appealing, or why an action is moral, rather than establishing rules for evaluating or creating good art or moral conduct.\n\nMoreover, critiques of art or morals never fully capture the essence of what is good or beautiful. Discussions on the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but ultimately, these do not explain why it is considered good art. Often, when asked about a favored artwork or literary piece, people might say, “There's just something about it,” before offering a more detailed critique. I believe that art and morals cannot be entirely reduced to their characteristics. As Flannery O'Connor states, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how thoroughly we describe a literary work, something transcendent remains. I think ethics shares this quality. Wittgenstein notes, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.” I propose that this “something,” this indefinable quality, is the most compelling aspect of art and morality, and that this transcendental nature provides a connection between them.\n\nI believe the close relationship between morality and art arises because we experience both most profoundly at a noumenal level, to use a Kantian concept. They affect us in ways that can be felt, but not entirely explained. This connection is even more pronounced in literature. As McKean remarks, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Modern Germany is seen as a powerful and unified nation, showcasing a diverse culture that stretches from the Alpine shadows in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This cultural richness extends from Cologne on the Rhine River, through the heart of Germany, to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. It's not surprising that contemporary Germany's culture stems from various sources and tribes.\n\nThe ancestral homeland of the Germans is known as Germania. The name's origin is a subject of debate among scholars and historians. Tacitus suggested it derived from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before crossing the Rhine to confront the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he subdued the Gauls and clashed with Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine under dubious motives. He borrowed this term from the Gauls themselves to differentiate between the Gauls he had conquered and the tribes he had not. While the exact origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighboring tribe in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter of his first book on these wars, Caesar mentions: \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others suggest the name could originate from the spear they used in warfare, called a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim, meaning \"to shout,\" implying that the Germans were loud or noisy (Names of Germany).\n\nIn his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" the early Roman historian Tacitus chronicled the origins of the Germans, asserting, \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)\" (Tacitus, 98).\n\nAnd who would choose to leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, at least not initially. They would send expeditions to Germania for goods and occasionally launch land campaigns, but typically they returned to their vast empire. As Germanic tribes began to emerge in the mid-first century, they settled on the Roman Empire's borders, trading goods from the land and serving as skilled soldiers in the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "In the play Twelfth Night, it suggests that while disguises can be effective tools for sustaining prolonged deception, ultimately, one must abandon these false identities to avoid losing their true selves. However, ending a deception can lead to feelings of alienation. Ultimately, a person must choose between self-preservation and maintaining relationships with those around them. Some may react indifferently upon discovering they've been deceived, while others may take offense at the deception. The issue of deception in gender role reversal brings additional complexities, most notably questioning why someone would feel compelled to abandon their own identity to adopt that of the opposite gender. For Viola, it is clearly a means of self-protection: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Upon arriving in an unfamiliar place, Viola finds it necessary to disguise herself as a man to ensure her safety from potential threats. Her plan succeeds, but it also isolates her from other women, severing her from a crucial support network. Complicating matters further, Viola's male disguise is so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and inadvertently falls in love with her, as shown by Olivia's plea: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, Viola must navigate her own repressed romantic feelings towards Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261). While this situation might seem progressive, modern readers might view Twelfth Night as a depiction of how deception can uncover hidden emotions, particularly for Olivia and Orsino. Certain sections suggest that these characters might have unspoken desires that Viola/Cesario’s presence compels them to confront. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because she perceives him as a man, or does she secretly have feelings for women? One might argue against this, as Shakespeare's portrayal of Olivia seems to satirize those of his era who judge others solely on appearance. This is demonstrated by how easily Olivia shifts her romantic interest from Cesario to Sebastian, eventually seeing Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German colonial rule has been characterized by many as particularly harsh, especially concerning the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in what was then German South West Africa. However, it's overly simplistic to describe an entire colonial empire with a single broad stroke. The policies and governance of the German colonial empire were as diverse as the territories it encompassed. Similarly, the educational systems varied across the colonies. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (now Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a significant number of educated and literate Africans. German efforts in education within Kamerun and other colonies received commendation from writers of the era. The scenario in South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) was notably different. Unlike East Africa, where the government established state schools and actively participated in educating the local population, in South West Africa, education for the natives was largely left to missionary groups with minimal government assistance. However, the government heavily invested in the education of Europeans in the region, setting up state schools and providing more substantial support and regulation for missionary schools. These policies continued to impact South West Africa long after German rule ended. While other German colonies had significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to the unique circumstances of South West Africa. This paper aims to delve into these factors, with a focus on recent research regarding the perspectives of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans. There is an extensive body of literature specifically addressing education in the German colonial empire. Most of these works, written in German during or shortly after the colonial period, aimed to describe the educational systems in these colonies. Later English-language studies expanded the conversation by comparing educational systems across different German colonies and analyzing specific educational aspects in greater detail. These studies highlighted significant differences between the colonies' educational systems. Cohen's work, a prominent study, explicitly addresses the theme of this paper by comparing the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa and discussing the factors accounting for their differences. According to Cohen, the large European settler population in South West Africa explains many of the unique features of its educational system. Compared to Germany's other colonies, South West Africa had a somewhat temperate climate, despite much of its land being arid desert. The European population reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans resided in South West Africa, while the next largest settler population was in East Africa, with only 5,336 Europeans.",
            "The United States and Mexico are examples of two countries that experienced a long-standing rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The peak of this conflict was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, gaining Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Numerous other conflicts occurred between the two nations, eventually subsiding just before World War I. The rivalry was fueled by clashes over key issues such as religion, culture, tradition, and significant material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis situation is similar to that of many other countries that have enduring rivalries with neighboring nations. Countries that share borders often experience conflicts of interest that lead to rival positions. The United States and Mexico are similar to many enduring rivalries between nations that share a common border. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, both of these countries are geographically close to the United States and have historically been rivals, while other Latin American countries have enjoyed good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences created a division between the two nations, a common issue throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). Similar to the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was both an ideological struggle and a competition over vital interests, the conflict here was based not on political structures but on religious preferences. This distrust stemmed from historical tensions between the English and Spanish, which were inherited from their former colonial rulers and posed a significant challenge in establishing friendly foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identified 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry. Most of these disputes, as described by Diehl and Goerts, involved territorial issues, such as border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier problems. Raids by bandits and outlaws into American border towns were a significant issue until both the United States and Mexico used military force to secure their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). Schmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry began to fade as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and concluded as American ambitions shifted \"from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p. 110) in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was unexpectedly and suddenly disabled by an illness I had never heard of. At that time, I was a nurse, a career I chose because of a strong desire for the safety and security I lacked during childhood. I often heard the saying, \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick,\" as I grew up. Even though my aspirations were to become a scientist or journalist—or perhaps a bit of both—I opted for nursing.\n\nNonetheless, there I was at 46 years old, single, with little savings and unable to work. I am still disabled today, and after 15 years of relying on Social Security Disability, I have almost nothing left that I can call my own. I manage to get by, but every day is a challenge, threatening my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Nothing in my life is predictable anymore, yet one thing remains true: I wouldn't have survived all these years without the support of my family and a few good friends, no matter how strong I believed myself to be. When true disaster hits, you don't feel strong at all.\n\nMy point is that emergencies, both big and small, are inevitable in life. There are no guarantees, and despite our best preparations, some challenges are too great to face alone.\n\nI completely agree that in the U.S., we should stop relying solely on big government, which is clearly deteriorating and ineffective. However, I would much prefer to see Americans learning to trust and assist one another and asking for help, rather than each of us individually retreating to build fallout shelters.\n\nConservatives in the U.S. often speak about the \"rugged individualism\" that built the nation, but truthfully, what sustained our ancestors during tough times was not rugged individualism but rather compassion, mutual respect, and resource sharing. The pioneers who journeyed across the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, definitely be prepared—I am. I have a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, plastic sheeting, and duct tape for windows in case of a biological attack. I own several flashlights, various batteries, plenty of candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and can preserve your own food, go for it. It's an excellent idea, as is having a wood stove, as long as you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while doing all this, make sure to get to know your neighbors.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born who would later be known as Buddha. Throughout his life, he gave up worldly possessions, achieved enlightenment, and his teachings laid the groundwork for Buddhism. The most traditional branch of this religion is called Theravada Buddhism. Buddhism has existed for about 2,500 years, and it has evolved since the time of Buddha. This evolution is evident in places like Sri Lanka, a Theravada Buddhist country, where the annual water-cutting ceremony takes place. This ceremony, involving both monks and laypeople, holds religious significance despite not being directly taught by Buddha. Changes in Buddhism range from surface-level traditions to the fundamental beliefs about salvation. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community, including both monastic and lay members, has had to adapt its principles due to various influences. These influences can be external or internal and can be either harmful or neutral. \n\nIn this discussion, several key terms will be used frequently. \"Internal\" forces originate within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic status, while \"external\" forces come from non-Buddhists. A \"hostile\" force is one that harms or intends to harm the Buddhist community due to negative views of Buddhism. A \"benign\" force neither aims to harm nor help the community but may inadvertently do one or the other. These terms will be referenced repeatedly.\n\nInitially, it's crucial to understand the fundamentals of the religion—the core doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma primarily comprises the Tripitaka, or the three baskets, of Buddhist writings. The Sutta Pitaka contains the discourses, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the monastic rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka includes the philosophical aspects of Buddhism. These philosophical aspects involve concepts like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (life's inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). By understanding these ideas, one can end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. Enlightenment brings an end to Sansara along with lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for life. Laypeople adhere to five precepts: not to kill, lie, steal, engage in sexual misconduct, or take intoxicants. Monks follow many more rules. The fundamental doctrinal concept in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths: first, the truth that life is suffering (Dukkha); second, that attachment causes suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture has a crucial impact on negotiations. It can be defined just as much by what it's not as by what it is and what it represents. Culture isn't uniform, nor is it a single entity. Broad statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are inherently simplistic and generalize too much. While understanding cultural generalizations can be useful, it's more beneficial for a negotiator to grasp how a culture's attitudes might influence the negotiation process. When encountering a foreign culture, one tends to relate it to their own, leading to inevitable comparisons.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset can range from studying its history to recognizing its biases. Instead of judging or trying to alter a culture, one should accept it as it is and work within its parameters, especially in negotiations, and particularly if one is negotiating from a weaker position. Similarly, if negotiating on foreign soil, respecting traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and advance the negotiation.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that culture isn't limited to national or international distinctions. Companies within a nation often have their own corporate cultures. For example, a corporate culture might prioritize long office hours or a more flexible schedule. Corporate culture can be observed in employee dress codes, communication styles (direct vs. indirect), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at all levels, while others limit it to company-approved initiatives. The differences in American corporate culture from one company to another (and even within companies across different regions and between urban and suburban areas) illustrate the diversity of thought within a societal culture. While some cultures may seem less stratified and more uniform, this similarity is often just a surface-level observation, prompting a deeper examination.\n\nUnderstanding values is even more crucial, as they explain the reasons behind a culture's behavior. If maintaining face or communal harmony is valued, a negotiator will avoid publicly embarrassing their company or superior to succeed. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that values hard bargaining won't rush to settle quickly. Considering these generalities is important before entering negotiations. However, it's beneficial for a negotiator to learn about their counterpart on a personal level to ensure effective negotiations.",
            "The statement \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God’” originates from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible and serves as the foundation for St. Anselm’s argument about God’s existence. Thomas Aquinas, another thinker we will examine, appears to share this belief. As both philosophers defend the same concept, our task is to evaluate whose argument is superior. For the sake of brevity, we will assume both are correct in their belief in the God of the Bible. Considering a different kind of God would not allow us to fairly compare their arguments, as both focus on the same specific notion of God. However, I propose that while each philosopher presents compelling points, neither offers a comprehensive foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo explore this, we will first look at St. Anselm’s basic argument. Anselm suggests that understanding through faith reveals God within oneself. He argues that because God exists in our understanding, we cannot truly imagine God’s nonexistence. Although his explanation can seem tedious and unclear, the essence is that the evidence for God is found in one’s own mind. St. Anselm advises us that truth about God resides within us, and we find it by examining what we inherently know to be true. External evidence is deemed unnecessary. This acceptance of beliefs without undeniable empirical evidence is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas proposes that God’s existence can be demonstrated solely through reason and empirical evidence, without requiring faith. This approach could aid in evangelism, a key element of Christianity, by converting new believers through logic rather than relying on their acceptance of unproven beliefs. St. Thomas outlines five logical arguments for God’s existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument shows that the need for God is logically necessary. Just as a missing puzzle piece can be identified by examining the assembled puzzle, logic allows us to infer the characteristics and existence of God without direct evidence.",
            "Authors often employ various methods to evoke specific emotions or perspectives in their readers regarding significant topics. Some of these methods prove more effective than others. In his novel, The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes numerous such techniques. Occasionally, Fitzgerald combines adjectives and nouns in unconventional ways to create a particular atmosphere around a subject. At other times, he assigns symbolic meanings to objects and uses them to achieve a similar effect. He notably applies this technique to colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald imbues colors like white/gray and red/pink with meaning, later using them to evoke specific emotions around significant objects.\n\nFitzgerald assigns a sense of uniformity to white/gray, with white symbolizing a slightly more refined and upper-class status, while gray denotes something older and more faded. He establishes this symbolism early in the novel, frequently referencing both colors. Daisy and Jordan are often depicted \"in white\" (8), and indeed, everyone seems to wear white: Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom is seen in a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only instance where white is absent is during Nick's observations of Gatsby's party: the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further solidifies the meanings of these colors by associating them with mundane, insignificant subjects: as Nick commutes to work, he travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names of Gatsby's party guests are \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's list, and Catherine's apartment is part of \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—denoting uniformity (28). He also uses white or gray to describe ordinary people or places: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) appear in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" on the train is \"gray\" (26), and the dog seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nAfter establishing these meanings for white/gray, Fitzgerald uses them to indicate insignificance or uniformity in certain contexts. This use of color symbolism begins with Daisy. After a period without notable references to these colors, Fitzgerald depicts Daisy \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" prompting readers to view Daisy as less of an individual character and more as a uniform entity, something that Gatsby yearns for (74). Fitzgerald continues using this technique with Daisy to reinforce the impression of her as a uniform element, such as mentioning the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18) and her \"white\" dress (115) before the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County boasts significant agricultural productivity due to its mild, sunny climate. The region's typical crops include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a strong demand for organic, community-supported agriculture (CSA) food in the area, with many local organizations having long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also favored. Numerous organic farms offer tours of their operations and provide opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. Such operations enable landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitats, thus facilitating recreational use and creating opportunities for farm tours and educational or profit-generating programs.\n\nWhile organic farming can tap into a potentially profitable niche market, it also offers benefits like increased biodiversity in plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemicals in soil and water. However, organic farming can be more costly than conventional farming, as it demands more labor and management to control pests, weeds, and soil fertility without chemicals. Organic farms often face higher losses compared to conventional ones, and small organic farms lack the efficiency of scale seen in larger operations. Moreover, practices that benefit wildlife, although not directly related to organic farming, may incur higher labor costs, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing, removing invasive species, and managing plant growth to create specific habitats. Therefore, there are several reasons a landowner might seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land selected for this scenario is a 160-acre parcel near Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It consists of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest, situated in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of San Diego's Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This plan, which is still under review, considers over a hundred plant and animal species, including endangered ones like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, as well as declining species like burrowing owls.\n\nHistorically, this area was inhabited by Native Americans for many centuries, and later, in the late 1800s, it was settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers. This land was once part of an original homestead patent and likely used for grazing and wood production over the decades.\n\nI chose a piece of property from a real estate website and investigated available government programs to explore options for a small farmer to reduce costs and maintain wildlife-friendly practices. As an example of what someone farming this land might aim to achieve, I identified an organic farm in the same vicinity.",
            "There exists a unique connection between brothers—an unbreakable and enduring bond. This connection encompasses a spectrum of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers have a profound understanding of each other, unmatched by any other relationship, and often see a reflection of themselves in one another. In moments of crisis, the true essence of this bond becomes evident, whether positive or negative. When these emotions surface, they come with significant consequences. Understanding the emotions that arise from this fraternal bond involves facing the repercussions they entail. Seeing oneself in a brother's eyes reveals one's true self, not as others perceive, but as they truly are. The real character is revealed through actions and their outcomes. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is explored by two brothers, alongside the intense emotions that accompany it. Against a backdrop of a rich and vividly depicted setting, these boys embark on a futile quest. The story reaches its climax as bitter disappointment clashes with immense pride, leaving only one brother alive. The theme is conveyed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, their interactions, and the narrator's perspective, which reveals the protagonist's complex feelings and worldview, both of which heavily influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single dominant emotion: pride. From the moment he and his younger brother, Doodle, venture out together to their final, ill-fated journey, he harbors resentment toward Doodle. He desired a brother with whom he could share his worldly skills, such as \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He longed for a companion to \"race to Horsehead Landing...and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn...\" These aspirations were unattainable due to Doodle's condition. Doodle was born with a severely weak heart, making his survival unlikely and vigorous physical activity nearly impossible. This realization was a harsh blow to the protagonist, whose dreams were dashed. At one point, he even harbored anger towards the fragile child, contemplating suffocating him with a pillow. What child would consider such an act? However, his heart softened when the small child smiled at him, an act that gave the protagonist hope. This indicates that his resolve was likely not strong, as he had an inherent love for his brother deep down.",
            "The human brain is a complex and inventive system for processing information. As technology has evolved from simple to advanced, so too have the metaphors for describing the brain. It was initially likened to a wax tablet, then a papyrus sheet, later a book, and now a computer. When learning about the brain, it's important to remember that these metaphors have limitations and can lead to misunderstandings.  \nInformation processing begins with sensory input, where physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound, or light rays are converted into electrochemical signals by sensory organs. The brain's algorithms continually transform this sensory information through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines basic details like color, orientation, and object borders—where color shifts abruptly—to determine that a box is present. Top-down processing then uses decisions from the bottom-up process to expedite the recognition of the box, such as identifying it as a black box instead of a box-like hole in the white.  \nAfter some degree of processing, an attention filter assesses the signal's significance and determines which cognitive processes should access it. For example, your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, but a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing each one individually. Conversely, you might notice your name being spoken even in a loud room. Processing occurs in multiple stages, with attention continuously modulating the results.  \nFor the brain to process information, it must first store it. Memory comes in various forms, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, with specific encoding types for different sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input might be encoded structurally (appearance of the word), phonemically (sound of the word), or semantically (meaning of the word). Once stored, information needs to be maintained. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which retains information for about 20 seconds, is maintained by electrical signals looping through specific neurons briefly. Long-term memory is thought to be preserved in the structure of certain proteins.  \nThere are many models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on human memory retrieval, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented as nodes, connected based on their relationships. For instance, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which could then link to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a devastating financial crisis. Unemployment rose, the housing market collapsed, and numerous major corporations were left in disarray. This recession continues today, prompting us to question: what caused this crisis, and how can it be prevented? Essentially, the crisis was triggered by shortsighted and selfish political decisions that coerced banks and firms into granting sub-prime loans within an already fragile financial system. At the same time, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were urged to underwrite and bundle these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves and the turmoil spread to the repackaged mortgages they had sold, and eventually, to the larger economy.\n\nThe origins of the financial crisis trace back to 1999 during the Clinton administration, as the President sought to secure a second term by boosting his popularity. The Clinton administration achieved this by easing lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under growing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income individuals and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its impressive profit growth.\" Holmes accurately predicted the outcome: \"But the government-backed corporation may face difficulties in an economic downturn, leading to a government bailout similar to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.\" As discussed earlier, and as Holmes predicted, such reckless lending inevitably led to economic collapse.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic downturn, one being the new, intricate mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were heavily utilized leading up to the crisis, further entangling various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This caused U.S. households and financial markets to overextend themselves in the housing sector, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that invested in these mortgage-backed securities suffered. The five leading U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, amounting to about 30% of the USA's GDP. Ultimately, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at very low prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to become commercial banks subject to stringent regulations. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac held $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That part of your story where you spread your creative wings and captivate everyone with your engaging, even enchanting, writing. Or, alternatively, the part where your readers might doze off or click away, muttering your name in frustration. Dr. Merlin has been known to yell at her screen when she finds herself amid an overload of information, and not in an entertaining way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy kind readers are already familiar with the basic writing advice, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still encounters lengthy text where nothing happens, or too much does. Exposition is like the mischievous imp on your shoulder urging you to lay out the backstory to get to the exciting parts (distinct from the other imp encouraging you to detail every character's childhood).\n\nExposition involves telling the audience what occurred, usually in straightforward prose. In movies, it happens when a character provides a data dump, reminiscent of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing this telling.\n\nLet's consider an example. As you're reading a story, you're informed that the heroine met her beloved at a specific time and place, they had a grand wedding, and her husband was killed before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this whole sequence to span two pages, with each getting only two lines of dialogue. You'd anticipate the author to delve into the husband's character, showing through his words and actions how much he loves his wife, and similarly, you'd expect the heroine to demonstrate, in various ways, how his presence transformed and enriched her life (especially if the story later states this directly). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally invested in his fate and provide insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, the depth of their connection, hints about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams reflected through his perspective, and so on. You would grieve his death with her, thereby deepening your connection to the heroine.\n\nIn essence, you'd expect substance on the simple framework of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that substance. (*looks at the metaphor, sighs, continues anyway*) Sometimes, it's tempting to gloss over certain details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character, and you know he was in the Air Force, now works as a night manager at a gas station, was married twice with no kids, enjoys weekend fishing, secretly dreams of owning the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first was NBC 4's live broadcast this morning (August 13, 2011). The main story involved a man from Ashley, Ohio, named Shad Hostettler, who had stabbed his wife. Although they didn't mention her name, they did show his mugshot and described him as looking menacing. The story was brief, lasting about two minutes, as it was still unfolding. The details given were that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I felt they allocated an appropriate amount of time to this report.\n\nThe second story covered an early morning shooting of an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area, leaving him critically injured. There were no arrests or suspects at the time, and the SWAT Team was investigating. This story was also short, possibly because it involved a \"black\" man or took place in a black neighborhood. I've noticed over the years that crimes involving minorities are often overlooked. If a \"white\" child or adult is kidnapped or becomes a crime victim, the media gives extensive coverage, but minority cases might not even be mentioned.\n\nAnother report was about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They shared details on where the incident likely occurred and identified the bullet as a .22 caliber from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThe next segment was about the predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to remain in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. The weather coverage was brief, likely intended as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nThey also covered a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie, about six feet tall and weighing around 150 pounds. I felt they spent an excessive amount of time emphasizing his skin color and how dark he was.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He was found guilty of conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, they stated his sentence as \"300 months\" instead of 25 years, possibly to make it sound harsher. They also mentioned his Hispanic ethnicity, which I didn't think was relevant to the story.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of security that aims to replicate the performance of an index, commodity, or collection of assets, similar to an index fund. However, it is more adaptable, as it can be traded like a stock on an exchange. An ETF offers the diversification advantages of an index fund along with the perks of single stock ownership, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase even just one share per transaction. These appealing benefits come with the added advantage of lower expense ratios compared to the typical mutual fund. Nonetheless, there are drawbacks, such as the need to pay a commission for ETF trades, just as you would for stock trades. Another advantage of ETFs is the wide range of funds available. Despite these stated benefits, it's wise for a prudent investor to assess whether these benefits, like diversification, genuinely exist and to what degree. In this analysis, we will focus on the ETF IHF, comparing it to its top 10 holdings to see if the advantages of owning a single ETF match those of holding a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, or if there are better configurations of the same stocks that offer a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo evaluate the ETF, we will focus on just the top ten holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets, as including every holding would be cumbersome. Below are the top 10 holdings and their percentage of total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use their current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate each stock's contribution to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consists entirely of these ten stocks in the proportions set by the ETF's holdings. The Beta and return calculations are shown in the chart below.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings has a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta for the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the entire ETF. These findings suggest that a portfolio limited to the top 10 holdings could yield a higher return with a lower beta. However, it's possible that the means of these two portfolios might not be statistically different.\n\nTo determine if these portfolios are statistically different, we calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalize them to 100%, and compare their cumulative standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, there was a steep decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project, which was somewhat discouraging, and it's unclear why this occurred. The arrival of winter at a New England campus likely led to fewer people commuting by bicycle or on foot, contributing to the decline. Additionally, December is the end of the fall semester, when people are busy completing schoolwork and grading, possibly causing the commuter log to be overlooked. Moreover, December marks the start of the hectic holiday season and a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many are not required to visit the campus. Classes resume in late January for the spring semester, which may also explain the low number of logs for that month. However, this doesn't fully account for the low submissions in February. It's possible that any project like this experiences initial enthusiasm that wanes over time. To counteract this trend, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign that successfully increased log submissions that month. Thus, a key challenge was maintaining project momentum despite a natural decline in engagement and the specific issues of holiday and semester breaks in higher education. Another challenge for this project, or any alternative commuting project, is that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars, which is deeply rooted in our culture. Therefore, providing incentives for alternative commuting is crucial. We offered many prizes, such as gift certificates to local eateries, coffee shops, massage therapists, an independent bookstore, and some larger national chains. It would have been interesting to see how offering larger prizes, like a bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car, might have influenced participation and helped address the dip in engagement. The prizes remained the same throughout the project, but increasing their value over time might have been beneficial. While the gift cards were sufficient at the project's start, announcing the addition of a few bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January might have boosted participation and engagement instead of seeing a decrease.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress’s collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films typically utilize creative editing to create illusions. My analysis primarily focused on detailing the stylistic elements prevalent in most trick films and identifying unique features in some later films. Generally, trick films from this period are confined to a set, shot within a frontal proscenium without any camera movement, relying on long and medium shots, and following a strict one shot = one film approach. However, a few films from the early 1900s deviate from these norms by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA key characteristic shared by these trick films is their filming on an interior set within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remains stationary, not following any figures or objects. This composition was typical in early films, influenced by theater and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. Due to this stage-like setup, movement in trick films is mostly lateral, with figures rarely moving towards or away from the camera. For instance, in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), actors enter from the right and move horizontally, but the camera does not track them when they exit the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also means that shots are predominantly long shots, with medium shots being less common, and close-ups never used in any Edison trick films. This mirrors the theater and vaudeville tradition, where the audience views the entire performance within the stage’s borders. Like many early films, actors remain in the middle ground, and close-ups are absent.\n\nTypically, early trick films adhere to the concept that one conceptual shot constitutes a film, limiting their duration to around a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. This also restricts the dramatic or narrative potential of trick films, which mostly showcase short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts, with minimal storytelling. However, in trick films, a single conceptual shot for the viewer might actually be a composite of several shots creating the illusion of appearance or disappearance. For instance, in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), a closer look reveals the point where the shot with Mary’s \"severed head\" starts, despite the entire film being perceived as one continuous shot by the viewer.",
            "Ian Watt characterizes the traditional \"Gothic Novel\" as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" in his work, The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic style has been both criticized and praised, accused of lacking depth yet admired for its 'terrible sublime' quality, as Burke notes. The first \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, blended elements from both \"ancient and modern\" romances to establish the proto-Gothic genre, offering a new literary expression. Walpole combines \"old\" theatrical elements with 'new' imitations of nature found in 'modern' novels to craft what he calls \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). This genre draws heavily from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even during the time The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" was applied to various peoples, styles, and eras, often seen as outdated or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" societal and literary \"progress.\" The merger of theatrical \"Gothic\" elements with the novel's new format, which provided a more personal insight into character psychology, contributed to the Gothic's enduring appeal, making it simultaneously obsolete and fresh to readers far removed from its original creation.\n\nA key Gothic concept in these novels is Chivalry. The medieval notion of chivalry, the training of a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is significant to Gothic authors because it symbolizes the ideal knight—brave, honorable, competent—and reflects the perceived absence of such ideals in society, a concern of writers like Walpole. By incorporating chivalric themes and manners, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized (foreshadowing the Gothic's evolution into Romanticism) to attempt to better the present. When writing The Castle of Otranto, Walpole was experiencing political turmoil and was disillusioned about the future. Engulfed in politics and possibly unjust accusations, he might have begun, perhaps subconsciously, to believe that the moral integrity and innate \"goodness\" of people from the gothic era had been lost in contemporary society. This notion is evident in several characters, including Frederic. Before meeting Frederic, the reader learns he embodies many chivalric qualities, described as:\n\nFrederic's portrayal includes numerous traditional chivalric images; he is primarily a prince who has endured hardship, suffered tragedy, and is thought to have been killed by infidels. The \"gallant and courteous Knight\" figure is exaggerated, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves a series of processes that move goods from the point of a customer's order through stages such as raw materials, supply, production, and distribution until they reach the customer. The concept of supply chain management was introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who defined it as the comprehensive process of planning, executing, and controlling supply chain operations to efficiently meet customer needs. There are six critical components of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to deliver optimal customer service.  \nProduction is the initial phase in the supply chain and serves as its cornerstone. This stage determines the timing, reasons, locations, and methods of production. Managers must understand customer preferences, which can be assessed by analyzing the market, the primary indicator of customer demand. Once managers comprehend market demands, they can decide on the products to manufacture and their quantities. Following these decisions, the next step is to determine the most suitable production facility, considering both volume and quality to meet customer satisfaction. After selecting the production site, managers focus on scheduling tasks and maintaining equipment. Production is a crucial element of the supply chain, where attention to detail is essential. Poor planning can result in significant time and financial losses for a company. For instance, in my experience working at Wal-Mart and Target, both retailers utilize structured guidelines and procedures for every business aspect, from employee uniforms to shipment reception. Such structured processes help companies operate efficiently, minimizing confusion and clarifying expectations.  \nThe second essential component of supply chain management is supply. Supply involves strategic decisions aimed at defining the core capabilities of a facility, with outsourcing partnerships developing from these decisions. A company might have various production divisions for a single product, each with different equipment, personnel, and expertise. Managers must determine which division best suits the different production processes. Additionally, management might opt to outsource work to other firms. The primary motivation for outsourcing is to enhance velocity, which is the ability to deliver quality and flexibility while keeping costs low or stable.",
            "Victorian novels are notable for their detailed descriptions and focus on the period's aristocracy. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights are two Victorian novels that diverge from this norm. These novels incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, which are uncommon in works from that era, enhancing the depth of their characters by offering insights into their motives and emotions.\n\n\"And now, a flood of bewildering and confusing thoughts crowded his mind. He felt as if he were still walking with Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily arguing, for he could hear their words; and when he focused on himself, he realized he was speaking to them. Suddenly, he was startled by the sound of gunfire, loud cries and shouts filled the air; lights flashed before his eyes, and everything was chaotic, as an unseen hand hurriedly carried him away. Amid these rapid visions, there was a vague, uneasy sense of pain that constantly tormented him.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nThe two novels frequently use mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and purpose differ in each instance. In Oliver Twist, these peculiar occurrences often reveal insights into Oliver's deeper layers, his struggles, and his understanding of the reality around him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he vividly relives it as if in a dream while trying to find help. This passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the events and the dire state of his health, which is evident in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing his senses, and he doesn't notice the \"unseen hand\" that carries him away; he re-experiences his despair, detached from the initial shock, as the pain is now constant and linked with fear instead of surprise. This overwhelming situation raises questions about who is responsible for his misfortune since it is certainly not Oliver himself. The shooting underscores Oliver's lack of control over his circumstances, as he cannot even attempt to influence the outcome of the events, even when his life is at risk. This selection implies a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, suggesting that old Fagin has begun to break him, pushing him into accepting despair and affecting his ability to react. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of his own life.\n\n\"The day passed – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as it arrived – and night came again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years back, I worked in an after-school program where I tutored elementary students. I aimed to assist them with any subjects they found difficult, although my expertise was in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to help a young boy named Adrian, who was in the third or fourth grade and struggling significantly with reading. I noticed something unusual about his difficulties; he could pronounce some letters perfectly while others were completely off, which was quite odd. Although Adrian was of Latino descent, he spoke flawless English. We continued having challenges until I met his mother. I was supervising a few kids who stayed behind while the rest went on a field trip when she came in. She didn’t speak English, only Spanish. Using my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate. That’s when I realized the issue: Adrian could read well, but he was unfamiliar with the English alphabet. I’m not sure if my discovery helped him much, but I hope he’s doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issue in schools, particularly in California. It also illustrates that the problem isn’t always obvious. Even a child who speaks perfect English can face significant reading challenges. Acknowledging that this issue exists is easy, but what do we do about it? For Adrian, the solution was straightforward: English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children who barely speak English, the solution is more complex. There isn't a single answer. A combination of dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes is necessary.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is beneficial, not only for children whose first language is Spanish but for all children. Studies show that children in bilingual programs often outperform their peers academically. There’s a lot of fear that this approach wastes resources and doesn’t benefit most students, but that’s incorrect. If these programs were standard rather than exceptions, all students would gain from them. But how do we implement this? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that would be unreasonable and somewhat unrealistic. However, there's no reason we can’t have special aides or tutors who are bilingual.",
            "From a young age, many of us are taught that there is something greater than ourselves, beyond our understanding. Some attend Sunday school to learn about it, others go to Temple, or seek answers within themselves. Many of us adopt the religions passed down by our parents, while some of us completely reject them, denying the existence of anything beyond our own egocentric world. We might embrace one set of beliefs, only to later change them for another. Whatever path we take, we strive to define a part of ourselves through our own spiritual perspectives. We search for guidance to lead us out of darkness and into the light.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father replied when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on our front porch, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof as we smoked together. The gutters spilled rainwater, drowning the plants along the porch's edge. He stared into the rain, a look that seemed part searching, part reminiscing. Over the past few months, he'd grown thinner, his clothes hanging loosely, and his hair was sparser than I remembered. He continued to gaze into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, scared, unable to express to him how much I would miss him, as speaking of it would make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer, and joined him in watching the rain fall in the June twilight.\n\nMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation hadn't eased his suffering but had prolonged his life a few months beyond the doctors' predictions; I couldn't see the value in just extending his pain. I wondered what kind of God would allow this. Alone in the night, I offered no prayers. If God existed, I felt He had long since stopped listening to me.\n\nI didn't want to witness him transition from this life to another. So I didn't. I couldn't bear to watch the end of the life that gave me life. I wanted to remember him for how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than anyone, better than his family, and I knew he wouldn't want his only child to witness his death. I stayed curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an enthusiastic early advocate of Republicanism. Although primarily a farmer, his profession, along with his short political career, made him known for his commitment to and outspoken views on personal freedom and government. His support for an agrarian system formed the foundation of nearly all his governmental opinions. His efforts to preserve and promote what he saw as the most esteemed career influenced his views on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the judicial system.  \nTaylor believed that the United States had a significant opportunity to establish an ideal system because there was no existing native tradition to constrain the government’s founders, allowing them to create a system of self-governance. He was a strong believer in the natural rights of individuals and argued that these rights are interconnected—if one is denied, they all fail, diminishing the value of those that remain. Therefore, these rights should be protected from government interference. He argued that what some referred to as the \"state of nature\" was a scenario where those with physical strength and malicious intelligence thrived, but this should not be the case in a civilized society.  \nTo build this ideal society, Taylor believed a government must be established that acknowledges the inherent good and evil within humans. Taylor held firm views on dualistic morality, asserting that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalism, and argued that a government founded on good principles would operate fairly, despite being led by greed and self-interest. He believed self-interest motivated all human actions but was only deemed evil when it extended beyond creating a society focused on the public good to forming sub-societies that exploited others. A good government was necessary to contain humanity's inherent evil, and it must be carefully monitored to prevent the introduction of bad principles.  \nTaylor, like many staunch Republicans of his era, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He desired a highly limited Federal government, with no more rights or powers than those explicitly granted in the Constitution. He understood that a large Federal government was costly and prone to despotism. However, he also believed that a simple, literal interpretation was risky and could easily become corrupt without considering the writers' intentions. Moreover, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defined the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind processing the scene before me with a detached clarity. Without any emotional involvement, I observed with a practiced focus that refused to connect the object of my observation to any abstract concepts. My thoughts came and went almost instantly, flowing so seamlessly that it seemed as though I had no real thoughts of my own—just a fluid experience of what I was viewing.\n\nOnce, following advice from an artist I collaborated with, I bought an instructional book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had aspired to draw since I was six, and this book covered everything from understanding a pencil to the brain's methods for interpreting lines. One method it taught was to place a square frame around any image the artist wanted to study, transforming a complex scene, like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room, into a manageable picture of just the bowl of fruit on a simple surface.\n\nAt that moment, as I looked down at the bowl before me, I couldn't mentally apply that artist's frame. Overwhelmed and in awe, I could only stand and marvel. Picasso had his blue period, Monet admired greenery, and Italian Renaissance artists displayed a spectrum of colors. If I had any notions of my perspective being artistically valuable, then in front of me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers touched my chosen tool of creativity. Muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand moved through space, transforming my mind's intention into what might have been the most imaginative moment of my life. Water swirled, calm and clear. Flakes of matter detached and drifted away. Muscles tightened, and with a bit more urgency, my hand slapped the toilet handle again. The stubborn brown mass remained, stuck like a slug at the bottom of the toilet.\n\nMop loosely in hand, feet spaced a foot apart, and a green tie uncomfortably knotted around my neck, I frowned slightly at the offensive bundle of processed matter someone had left as a message for those who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid. After a few more flushes and some tranquil, introspective moments, my hand reached for the toilet paper, wrapping itself until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand slowly dipped into the bowl, like a mother reaching into the oven for the Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "Teen drivers are losing their lives in car accidents. Various factors contribute to this alarming trend among America's youngest drivers. According to the National Institutes of Health, a significant issue is that teenagers' brains are not fully equipped to handle driving hazards. Their lack of experience is another core problem, leading not only to more fatal crashes but also to increased incidents of rollovers, speeding, and losing control of the vehicle. Additionally, teenagers are at greater risk when driving with their peers, a common occurrence. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has found a link between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents.\n\nTo improve teen driver safety, states like California have implemented temporary provisional licenses that impose restrictions on driving hours and passenger limits for minors. However, I believe these provisional licenses are merely temporary solutions. The fundamental issue is that young drivers, as a demographic, are statistically unprepared to manage the inherent risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even at age 18, individuals may be too young for a standard driver's license. USA Today highlights Zuckerman's research, which suggests that people under 19-20 have a propensity for thrill-seeking. Therefore, it might be prudent to delay driving until this tendency diminishes. If we continue to license young teens, fatal accidents will persist, and the death toll could rise dramatically in the coming years, especially as the children of Baby Boomers become eligible to drive by 2010, increasing the number of teen drivers on the roads.\n\nAddressing this issue through legislation could be relatively simple. Schools could still offer driver's education to prepare future drivers, but no one under 18 should be allowed to drive. Provisional permits could still be issued before a full license, with a requirement for a specific number of practical driving hours, similar to current state requirements, such as California's six hours of driving instruction and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Given that the troubling statistics for teen drivers are consistent across states, a uniform national law could be a sensible and effective way to protect teens nationwide. The legislative approach I propose is not new.",
            "This paper explores three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with a concise definition of the disorder, followed by an explanation of its diagnosis, highlighting key characteristics or \"red flags.\" The paper concludes with strategies that teachers in mainstream classrooms can use to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), involves the central nervous system's (CNS) ability to process auditory information efficiently and effectively. More specifically, (C)APD pertains to the perceptual processing of sounds within the CNS and the neurobiological activity that supports this processing, leading to electrophysiological auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it is a condition where the brain struggles to properly process auditory information. Individuals with CAPD have normal hearing and are not classified as \"hearing impaired\"; instead, the brain region responsible for interpreting what is heard, such as differentiating words or distinguishing conversation from background noise, does not function as it should.\n\nThe first reference to the disorder later known as CAPD dates back to the mid-1950s, initially termed \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), during research on children with communication disorders. In 1954, the Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started developing tests for these children. By 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the physiology of the central auditory nervous system (CANS) underlying dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 further stimulated research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways, including difficulty localizing or hearing sounds in space, distinguishing between multiple acoustic events, recognizing sound patterns, detecting changes in speech (such as sarcasm), experiencing sound masking, synthesizing auditory clues into meaningful actions, and determining the sequence of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves screening the patient through \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,\" which can be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals using various measures to evaluate auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This process may include questionnaires, surveys, and observations of auditory behavior, assessing how the patient responds to specific stimuli. Currently, no single tool or test consistently achieves a high diagnostic success rate, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Many tests involve presenting the patient with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and asking them to differentiate certain items, such as a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to those signals.",
            "In my pursuit of a social work education, I aim to build a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on aiding children who have suffered abuse or neglect and offering support to families in crisis. The values I bring to social work include service, respect, ethics, a commitment to fostering better relationships among people, and a dedication to professional self-improvement to maintain competence. These values are not only crucial to social workers but are also personally significant to me.\n\nI have always been driven to help others, though I was initially uncertain about which career path to take. During high school and college, I noticed many people avoiding their problems or resorting to unhealthy coping methods. These observations led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. However, still unsure about my career direction, I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, a visit to a friend introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy on her couch, who was there to escape his abusive parents. The following day, I learned he had contacted the police regarding his situation. Eager to assist, I visited his parents’ home, expressed my concerns to the police, and mentioned my recent Psychology degree. The police asked me to speak with the parents, as the law offered no solution for the teenager. When I confronted the parents, they appeared uneasy and offered excuses for their son's \"manipulative\" behavior in seeking outside help for \"simple\" family disputes. This experience prompted me to seriously consider a career in social work to aid children facing such \"simple\" family conflicts.\n\nAnother crucial value in social work is social justice. Society often emphasizes the importance of the individual and mourns those lost, yet clings to outdated traditions rather than true individuality. If we mourn lost individuals, why do we strive for conformity? I embrace my individuality and resist limiting myself to fit in. Throughout high school and college, I actively protested against social injustice, whether it was through expressing myself with bold hair colors, wearing clothes that reflected my personality, getting multiple ear piercings, joining the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), or speaking out against racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. I firmly believe in social justice and will continue to oppose social injustice.",
            "This paper examines the Biological and Sociocultural models concerning the disorder insomnia. The biological model emphasizes inherited genetic information and medical health aspects. In contrast, the Sociocultural models consider environmental relationships and their relevance to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The review of insomnia explores these models, discussing each selected study to enhance understanding of the models. The research explanations and findings are critiqued for their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified as primary sleep disorders, those related to another mental disorder, or those linked to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while sleep disorders associated with another mental disorder relate to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorder categories may result from medical conditions or substance use. Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in achieving or maintaining sleep, whereas Primary Hypersomnia involves trouble staying awake, both persisting for at least a month. Narcolepsy is characterized by cataplexy and/or automatic REM. Dyssomnias focus on sleep initiation and maintenance, while Parasomnias involve behavioral or physiological abnormalities during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep issues due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily focuses on insomnia and, to some extent, primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genes, heritable factors, and physiological aspects related to sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study conducted on mice revealed that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are responsible for sleep/wake states. Activating the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep, and inhibiting it can reduce anxiety and promote sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) was found to increase sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that mouse models can be extrapolated to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A malfunction or absence of this receptor could impair the ability to achieve adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication is that if the phenotype is inherited, it may regulate sleep, and any alteration in the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep, adversely affecting aspects of life such as education, career, and daily activities requiring focus and monotony.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for roughly two and a half years, equating to four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many, myself included. During my freshman year, I lived in a dorm in East Halls, which is essentially the farthest eastern point of the campus, aside from the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard building, located near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes, especially in the frequently bad weather typical of State College. An alum I spoke to, not much older than myself, mentioned that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the university by large expanses of unused land. Now, that space is occupied by sports fields, large new buildings such as the new Creamery and health services building, and is surrounded by apartments. As our campus continues to grow, moving from one area to another becomes increasingly difficult. What’s the best solution to the mobility issue? On a college campus, it's the bicycle. But simply having bikes isn't enough; students need to use them, and the campus should be designed to accommodate cyclists.\n\nI spoke with a friend who recently started biking again after several years. He expressed surprise at why he ever stopped, saying, \"Bikes are great. For a while, it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” Bicycling not only benefits your health but is also the most efficient mode of travel. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical effort can cover 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off-campus, about as far from the campus center as some dorms. The smartest decision I made this year was to purchase a bike. I have a class in the Thomas building every day, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. Biking can reduce that time to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. The only issue is that Pollock Road is the most direct route to the Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, whether on a bike or on foot. Walking has its merits, but I'm too busy for it. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable means to reach class. Walking to Thomas every day would consume an extra 30-40 minutes of my day, totaling over two and a half hours each week. Adding in the time spent walking to other classes and appointments, that's more time than I can afford.",
            "In \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley criticizes the looming dangers of technology and the capitalist systems that support it by depicting a dystopian society. In this world, people prioritize community over individuality and are conditioned from birth to seek immediate gratification above all else. The citizens are mere pawns in a larger scheme, bound to a single ideology as determined by the World Controller. Through a Marxist lens, one can discern Huxley's skepticism towards the development of these systems. Marxist terms such as homogeny and reification underscore the notion that Huxley's novel critiques the shortcomings of the emerging economy of his era. \n\nCapitalism is critiqued through the Marxist concept of false consciousness. Essentially, ordinary citizens are prevented from understanding their true economic relationships with other classes, as they are focused solely on their own benefits. This is attributed to the ideological control over the proletariat and common workers, clearly demonstrated by the conditioning of people in \"Brave New World.\" The lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, lack true autonomy; through hypnopaedia, the urge to consume, spend, and indulge is prioritized above all else. This manipulation is orchestrated by the World Controller. Hegemony, the idea that social classes are dominated entirely by another group, is evident here. The lower classes remain unaware of their manipulation, quite literally 'buying into an ideology that supports that structure' (i.e., capitalism and consumerism). The upper classes have the capacity to recognize this manipulation but remain passive; few Alphas or Betas, beyond characters like Bernard, challenge their roles. The interactions between social classes, as further discussed, highlight the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" genuine relationships between individuals are absent. The novel seemingly does not differentiate characters, even among main figures, who lack depth. Huxley may be implying that the combination of technological and capitalist advances strips individuals of their free will and self-expression. Love and emotional extremes are nonexistent; interactions are superficial, notably reflected in how men discuss women primarily based on their physical attributes (such as their 'pneumatic' quality), and how women openly comment on their encounters. Additionally, each societal class's contentment with their hierarchical status reflects the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their unwavering compliance with their societal roles highlights Marxist views on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform with their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in an Islam course at CBC. A significant topic that sparked intense debate in the class was whether Islam is inherently hostile. I feel this question is even more pertinent today than it was in the past. Reflecting on the events since 9/11, I've noticed a shift in the media's portrayal of Islam, from a hostile perspective towards extremists to a more tolerant stance regarding Islam in America. Back in 2001, it seemed unlikely that a presidential candidate with a name like Barack Obama, who has evident Muslim heritage in his family, could emerge.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet fascinates me because, based on my understanding of Muhammad's history, it seems to contradict his character. From what I previously knew, I believed Muhammad compelled people to convert to Islam, conquering tribes and imposing the religion on them. However, the biography portrays Muhammad as a martyr who was misunderstood and demonstrated humility to others, leading people to gradually recognize the 'truth' in his teachings and seek him out.\n\nFurthermore, there are striking similarities between Jesus' ministry and the 'miracles' attributed to Muhammad. One notable instance is when Muhammad supposedly multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men. This narrative style suggests that the authors aimed to depict Muhammad as a humble prophet who lived truthfully and performed miracles without needing to prove himself. I find this problematic as it diminishes the miracles and life of Jesus Christ, as if they are trying to attribute Jesus' significance to Muhammad.\n\nAdditionally, many stories in the biography appear to serve an agenda of demonstrating how people converted to Islam 'on their own.' However, these accounts are often relayed from a third-party perspective, such as hearing from someone who heard from another, and so on. This approach, intended to validate the stories, instead made them seem less credible and more suspicious to me.\n\nWhat troubles me most about the work is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure—humble, wise, and gentle. Yet, historical accounts contradict the notion of Muhammad being gentle and humble, and I wonder if contemporary Muslims are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's ascent to power.",
            "The core teachings and beliefs of Jesus during his lifetime were quickly set aside as Christian thought evolved after his death. Observing this historical trajectory, it becomes evident that Christianity has gradually drifted away from its original roots. In today's world, there is a growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive attitude. While traditionalists exist and will resist any thinking beyond what they have been taught, they may not have enough influence to sway the entire population. Among Christians, awareness of history is expected to expand significantly in the coming years, sparking a desire to differentiate the doctrines added over time from the true intentions of Jesus. Although it may take decades or even centuries, the outcome seems inevitable: a significant reversal in the trend of Christian history, moving back to its original form. A movement will emerge, gradually peeling away layers of doctrine as if time were reversing, until only the essence of what Jesus introduced to humanity remains, before other thinkers made their claims. As this trend spreads across the United States and Europe, influencing many to practice faith as if they were living in Jesus' time, following only his teachings, the church as an institution will remain strong to guide the way. However, with the theological clock moving backward, the current diversity within Christianity will give way to increasing uniformity in belief and practice. Differences between regions, denominations, and divisions will diminish, resulting in greater similarities. Human history is marked by significant reversals, such as when Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, which later became a Christian institution. Our country has transitioned from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The forthcoming great reversion will unfold within the realm of Christianity, seeking to return to its origins and reducing diversity in the process. A crucial element in this transformation will be interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically rather than literally. So, what has transpired since Jesus' time? Looking far back into history reveals only Judaism, the theological precursor to Christianity. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the concept of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were central to the faith. However, the Jewish population was not unified, dividing into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I think that \"The Jungle\" illustrates how people are inherently greedy and self-serving. They focus solely on improving their own lives without considering those beneath them. This is evident throughout the book, particularly in the behavior of the factory owners and managers. They prioritize expanding their businesses, with no concern for the people or things harmed in the process. Upton Sinclair's narrative describes the destructive impact of pollution, highlighting the owners' disregard for human and animal welfare. They overlook the smoke pouring from the factories and the waste from the livestock pens in Packingtown.\n\nFurthermore, the owners and managers show little concern for their workers, who toil to make them wealthy. They exploit their employees to maximize profits, with \"a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds\" prevailing throughout the workplace, where financial gain takes precedence over human value. Workers endure long hours and face sudden mass layoffs without compensation or job placement assistance. During the time period depicted in \"The Jungle,\" there were few, if any, laws ensuring worker safety and wellbeing, allowing for rampant exploitation and poor working conditions. Although the book doesn't explicitly state it, those who lived and worked in Packingtown were expected to endure the harsh realities both on the job and in their living environments, with no support from agencies or organizations. While unions existed, they often exploited the workers instead of aiding them. The dire treatment and lack of escape from Packingtown's system left workers akin to slaves, described as a \"low-class and mostly foreign\" population teetering on starvation, reliant on ruthless management reminiscent of slave drivers. Under such conditions, immorality was as prevalent and inevitable as in the era of chattel slavery.",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is considered by Edgar Allan Poe to be one of his finer poems. In this work, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which scholar Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil mentioned Thulé as an island located north of Britain, regarded by the Greeks as the boundary of the known world. While Virgil indeed used the term, there is a more contemporary source that deserves acknowledgment. Poe had a keen interest in German authors. This connection is significant as it highlights Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" notes the similarities between their poems, suggesting that Poe was imitating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned writer of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe’s death. Within the second part of \"Faust\" is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells of a king whose wife dies after gifting him a goblet. In mourning, he drinks heavily and cries over his lost queen. Eventually, he resolves to die, giving his possessions to his children, except for the goblet, which he throws into the sea before closing his eyes and dying. The king's demeanor in \"The King of Thulé\" and the description of the king in \"Dream-Land\" are quite similar, possibly reflecting a dark mirror of Poe's own experiences with loss and drinking. \"Faust\" was also adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just before Poe's use of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe mentions Thule twice in his collected works. He references \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and uses the phrase twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be viewed as complementary pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes Thule’s landscape as dark and lonely, haunted by the memories of deceased friends, and devoid of color. These visions resonate with \"The King of Thulé,\" where the king, having lost his wife, is lonely and lacks the will to rule or live. The entire poem seems to depict the speaker stepping into Goethe’s creation.\n\nGoethe was an influential author whom Poe would have known, if only through his admiration for Tennyson. Poe expressed his respect for Tennyson and, through this connection, would have been exposed to Goethe’s work, which was widely reproduced after its original release.",
            "Under California law, a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store might be entitled to punitive damages if it can be shown that the store manager acted with malice by neglecting to clean the spill for half an hour, despite being informed twice, because he was having dinner. It's unlikely that a judge would outright dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive damages. To justify such a claim, a plaintiff must provide evidence that the defendant acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm their conduct could cause, and that the conduct was despicable. Palmer could argue that Martin should have anticipated the harm from not cleaning a spill, given that several D&D customers had previously been injured in similar incidents in the months before her accident. Despite this awareness, Martin did not address the spill. Although Palmer’s claim that Martin’s actions were despicable is less compelling, it remains plausible considering that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009, yet Martin still failed to ensure store safety.  \n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin, who was on a dinner break, dismissed the issue, saying he \"didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also informed Martin of the spill, receiving the same response. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill, suffering a severe back injury. Before Palmer’s accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been recorded at D&D’s in 2009. Palmer is suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages for her injuries, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, punitive damages can be awarded for breaches not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice\" (Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010)). The law defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm or, if not intentional, conduct that is \"despicable\" and performed with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others\" (id. at § (c)(1)). The courts have described conduct as malicious when it is carried out with a conscious disregard for the plaintiff’s rights and where the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences\" (Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979)).",
            "She had always felt a sense of longing, an unfulfilled desire that emerged when she was about 14, just starting her teenage years. This yearning persisted even three years later at 17. By then, she realized she was searching for someone, not something. However, she hadn't developed any interest in boys, despite some showing interest in her with awkward efforts to win her over. She often questioned herself about this unusual feeling, pondering what could make such a peculiar thing happen to a teenage girl. Years of reflection had produced theories, but none convincing enough for her to dwell on. So she continued living her life, constantly questioning her desires.\n\nAt home, days were usually peaceful. Her parents were calm and gentle people, rarely arguing with each other or with her. Their only disagreements were about her asserting her independence and free spirit. She was the lively daughter of a serene couple, her vibrant and fun personality making her well-liked along with her kindness.\n\nBut today wasn't peaceful. As she moved around the house searching for new inspiration, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, her mother's lovely voice. She rushed to the room, panicking as she frantically asked, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the floor, appearing to be in pain, repeatedly saying \"Ow\" with short breaths. The daughter hurried to her side, trying to help. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital,\" her mother said in rushed, strained words, indicating she was in severe pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Following her mother's guidance, she felt grateful for the strength she had gained from her classes. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the back, and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital visit was filled with the smell of disinfectant and an atmosphere of fear and illness, but she was too focused on aiding her mother to notice. She swiftly carried her injured mother inside and called for medical assistance. Several concerned faces gathered, and someone quickly brought a rolling bed to lay her mother on. They immediately took her for examination, leaving her daughter to anxiously wait.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a stepping stool while trying to reach a vase from their highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a decreased risk of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet is an adjusted version of the Med diet, characterized by increased consumption of plant foods, such as plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (in preference to saturated fats), and fish, with a reduced intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown an inverse relationship between adherence to a Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, and an intervention trial found the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, prior studies did not specifically address stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) that evaluated nutrient intake over the previous year. Over 95% of the nurses continued their participation throughout the 20-year period, and the FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed via medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, cases were deemed \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts classified as such. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of postmenopausal hormones were calculated for each FFQ, and from 1986 onwards, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo minimize individual random variation and better capture long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were computed (averaging scores from the previous two years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could obscure results) by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the relationship between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with distinct models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nA higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as shown by an elevated aMed diet score, was linked with a reduced risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up, there were 2,391 new CHD cases, 1,763 new stroke cases, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (including fatal CHD and strokes combined). Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The sign declares, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" \n\nEllen Page, known for her role in Juno, stands alone on a street corner holding a cardboard sign with this disturbing message, written in Sharpie. Burma, now called Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by an oppressive military junta that seized power in a 1962 coup. In 2007, the country witnessed its first public demonstrations in a decade, led mainly by Burmese monks. These protests became known as \"The Saffron Revolution,\" named after the monks' saffron-colored robes. Initially, the government allowed the monks to protest peacefully, but the situation soon deteriorated into what many viewed as a full-scale conflict between the monks and the military junta, with the military invading and pillaging monasteries nationwide. Foreign journalists were detained and imprisoned, with Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai being killed on September 27, 2007, simply for attending a street protest. Although the official death toll was reported as 13, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army shortly before the official announcement, claimed that \"many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is not a new phenomenon. While these examples are among the more recent atrocities in our world, the desire of governments to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over their citizens has existed throughout history. Early Roman emperors proclaimed themselves divinely chosen to have complete authority over every aspect of society. Japanese emperors were believed to be gods themselves, sent to lead their people to prosperity. Meanwhile, then-U.S. President George W. Bush reportedly had regular calls with Ted Haggard, leader of an organization for uninformed individuals, affiliated with the Republican Party.\n\nNotable historical examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to challenge authoritarian rule. The death toll from this event is disputed, with Chinese government reports stating 200-300 deaths, while the Chinese Red Cross reported 2,000-3,000. Another instance is the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s, where Hutu militias, backed by the government, systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of their ethnicity. Hitler's 'Third Reich' is another extreme case, involving the widespread persecution and execution of Jews across multiple countries.",
            "Duke Ellington's significant contribution to jazz is largely attributed to his long career and his exceptional ability to shape his orchestra creatively. While his presence at the piano is understated in many of the compositions for this assignment, as a composer, Ellington was adept at crafting intricate and layered pieces that highlighted the talents of individual band members. He designed frameworks that allowed soloists to improvise freely, alongside composing tightly orchestrated segments that leveraged the unique styles of his musicians to enhance musical concepts. In this way, he also accentuated the overall tone of the orchestra, producing cohesive and original sounds for each composition. Ellington's expertise in understanding the distinct sounds of his musicians and how they integrated within an expanding ensemble enabled him to create some of the most innovative and remarkable works in jazz history. The Grove Music dictionary, when discussing Ellington's sound and innovation, cites \"Creole Love Call\" as an example of his use of the voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This early piece illustrates Ellington's application of the voice to add texture and color without relying on lyrics. \"Creole Love Call\" also showcases Ellington's knack for complementing the style of his soloists, a skill evident throughout his career. This measured, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece consists of six choruses: Chorus 1 features a call and response between voice and reeds, transitioning from a smooth, melodic start to a rougher end. Chorus 2 has a muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the main melody, highlighting several extended blue notes. Chorus 3 includes a sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, supported by a subtle syncopated piano phrase. Chorus 4 sees the full band echoing the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections. Chorus 5 is the climactic section, with the reeds initiating the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. Chorus 6 revisits the first chorus's structure, with call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice employs the \"growl\" technique, soloing like an instrument. The piece concludes with a brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by the trombone. Ellington's use of voice to add tonal color to this piece is a stylistic hallmark throughout his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington merges his skill in tight orchestration with his sensitivity to tone color. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing blends the vocal qualities of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice, creating a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" further develops these ideas, as Ellington effectively utilizes Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a regular in Ellington's orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "What drives the evolution of organisms in specific ways? Are there limitations that shape the path of evolutionary changes? In 1917, D’Arcy Thompson remarked that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" and this statement still holds true today. Recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to understand general aspects of mollusk shell formation throughout their development and evolutionary history (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of developmental and evolutionary changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help reveal the mechanisms behind the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental changes. We used X-ray images of Prunum species to define quantitative parameters for modeling both hypothetical and real shell shapes. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We created models of potential shell shapes to explore the limits of morphological change in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a deeper understanding of major evolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be imagined as a tube that moves over time through 360 degrees of space. The turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which whorls expand can vary, with a continuous line called a suture marking each whorl. Typically, the largest whorl in a shell is the final one, known as the body whorl. The spire consists of all whorls except the last, with the apex marking the tip of the spire and the opposite end called the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The \"usual\" orientation is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.)\n\nTo count whorls, begin by viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying where the first suture starts. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell into two sections. Whorls are counted from this line and estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a sequence of apertures that progress through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced using the coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture, along with the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be depicted both graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical model is established, it is possible to adjust parameters and alter the mollusk’s shell formation process.",
            "Over the past decade, the rates of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia have remained largely unchanged. Although the nation is progressing towards several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, the improvements in child and maternal health are insufficient to reach the 2015 targets. The reasons for these deficiencies will be explored below, highlighting the necessity of enhancing the health system rather than concentrating solely on program-specific interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen progress in the number of births attended by skilled health workers, with 72% currently meeting this criterion. However, this statistic includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who cannot perform medical interventions in complicated pregnancies, which contributes to the high rate of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. Thus, the advancements in this indicator may be somewhat deceptive, indicating much work still needs to be done. Moreover, there is a decrease in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five being treated by healthcare professionals. Although data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is evident that this is also an area of concern, with low rates reported nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain below expectations at around 4%. The disparity in c-section rates—7% in urban areas compared to just 2% in rural areas—highlights a significant issue of unequal healthcare access. Clearly, healthcare services are concentrated in urban locales. Access issues also relate to vertical equity, with a 27% gap in service use between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles, suggesting that the poor have far more difficulty accessing healthcare, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn considering future strategies for improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the fundamental question is how best to address the lack of services. Should Indonesia focus on developing program-specific strategies or on strengthening the overall health system without singling out pre and postnatal care for mothers and children? While targeted programmatic approaches are appealing due to their precise, manageable goals and typically quicker results, they come with certain drawbacks. A significant downside is that concentrating resources on one health sector often leads to neglect in others, with human resources gravitating towards better-funded areas (as seen with international funding for HIV/AIDS impacting the family planning sector). Additionally, running multiple parallel programs can lead to redundant and uncoordinated services, increasing the administrative burden for supplies and funding applications.",
            "Over the last century, the classification of Popular Music has expanded so much that it is challenging to list all the genres. Adding to the complexity, nearly all genres—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—have given rise to numerous sub-genres and even sub-sub-genres. One could argue that the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has evolved into one of the most varied and expressive genres in popular music over the past 40 years. Its expressiveness comes from its broad emotional range, often leaning toward darker themes. The diversity of Heavy Metal became evident soon after its inception, as people recognized its flexibility and began creating their own sub-genres, leading to further sub-sub-genres, a trend that continues today.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal movement has diversified into so many niche groups that defining what constitutes heavy metal has become challenging. It has incorporated a wide array of themes from other genres, but, like anything else, it originated from somewhere. To truly understand the metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp what the metal movement is and why it is considered a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nIn many respects, metal is a movement characterized by darkness. It can be described as a \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more aggression, more theatricality. It is less primitive and more sophisticated; musicians in metal bands are highly skilled, and this proficiency is evident in their music. Metal is also a movement heavily influenced by drugs, particularly during the psychedelic drug surge in the mid-70s, which led to increasingly wild and other-worldly music, with drugs serving as a catalyst for creation. It possesses many dark, visceral qualities that were new to the music scene as much of popular music tended to avoid the darker emotional spectrum. Additionally, later generations of metal have drawn some inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities prominent during the Romantic Era. Lyrics like those in \"Helter Skelter\" illustrate the darkness that is central to the movement.\n\nThe lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" showcase the darker side of The Beatles, reflecting a turbulent, possibly drug-influenced journey. This song is sometimes considered one of the first Heavy Metal tracks, created in response to a Rolling Stones song with similarly heavy, dark themes. The Beatles wanted to demonstrate they could be just as intense as the Stones, so they included this song on The White Album.",
            "Several decades before the Surrealists started creating their dream-inspired art, Henri Rousseau was meticulously developing his own dreams, both in reality and in his imagination. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only depicts a woman marveling at the wonders of a dream world but also embodies Rousseau’s personal aspirations and ambitions as an artist. Since he began his artistic journey, Rousseau longed for recognition, acceptance, and acclaim from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet he grappled with a significant internal conflict to fulfill this ambition. The Dream illustrates Rousseau’s lifelong internal struggle to either conform to or imitate popular art styles to gain acceptance within the critical art community he admired, or to maintain his creative independence and forge his own path.\n\nTo fully appreciate The Dream from this perspective, one must first understand Rousseau’s background. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who experienced \"bourgeois prosperity\" (Shattuck 47). Without any formal artistic training, Rousseau worked until the age of forty in France’s municipal toll service, known as a gabelou, though he was mistakenly referred to as a douanier, or customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The loss of his first wife Clémence, following the deaths of eight infant children, left him with one surviving daughter, Julia, and deep sorrow (Shattuck 49). Seeking solace and a new beginning, Rousseau turned to painting for comfort. Unlike his contemporaries who idealized the peasant life in their art, Rousseau was fundamentally a folk painter with the aspirations common to his social class.\n\nRousseau’s intense desire for acceptance in the art world is understandable considering his circumstances: he was self-taught, started his artistic career later in life, and was creating art alongside many other renowned modern artists. Despite years of work, Rousseau only began to receive due recognition around the same time Matisse was establishing his reputation. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes that although Rousseau and Matisse were technically rivals, they differed in style, subject matter, and their motivations for painting: “Matisse feared painting in a clichéd manner, while Rousseau aspired to create art so conventional he would gain entry to the Artiste Français” (92).",
            "Numerous prominent thinkers have suggested a deep link between ethics and aesthetics, as well as between truth and beauty. I think there is a fundamental reason for this connection. As John Keats expresses in “Ode on a Grecian Urn,” “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of our knowledge comes from education or experience, but we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics naturally, as Keats hints, without formal teaching. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than dictate. Our exploration of morality and beauty primarily seeks to explain why a piece of art or literature is appealing, or why an action is moral, rather than establishing rules for evaluating or creating good art or moral conduct.\n\nMoreover, critiques of art or morals never fully capture the essence of what is good or beautiful. Discussions on the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but ultimately, these do not explain why it is considered good art. Often, when asked about a favored artwork or literary piece, people might say, “There's just something about it,” before offering a more detailed critique. I believe that art and morals cannot be entirely reduced to their characteristics. As Flannery O'Connor states, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how thoroughly we describe a literary work, something transcendent remains. I think ethics shares this quality. Wittgenstein notes, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.” I propose that this “something,” this indefinable quality, is the most compelling aspect of art and morality, and that this transcendental nature provides a connection between them.\n\nI believe the close relationship between morality and art arises because we experience both most profoundly at a noumenal level, to use a Kantian concept. They affect us in ways that can be felt, but not entirely explained. This connection is even more pronounced in literature. As McKean remarks, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Modern Germany is seen as a powerful and unified nation, showcasing a diverse culture that stretches from the Alpine shadows in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This cultural richness extends from Cologne on the Rhine River, through the heart of Germany, to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. It's not surprising that contemporary Germany's culture stems from various sources and tribes.\n\nThe ancestral homeland of the Germans is known as Germania. The name's origin is a subject of debate among scholars and historians. Tacitus suggested it derived from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before crossing the Rhine to confront the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he subdued the Gauls and clashed with Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine under dubious motives. He borrowed this term from the Gauls themselves to differentiate between the Gauls he had conquered and the tribes he had not. While the exact origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighboring tribe in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter of his first book on these wars, Caesar mentions: \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others suggest the name could originate from the spear they used in warfare, called a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim, meaning \"to shout,\" implying that the Germans were loud or noisy (Names of Germany).\n\nIn his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" the early Roman historian Tacitus chronicled the origins of the Germans, asserting, \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)\" (Tacitus, 98).\n\nAnd who would choose to leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, at least not initially. They would send expeditions to Germania for goods and occasionally launch land campaigns, but typically they returned to their vast empire. As Germanic tribes began to emerge in the mid-first century, they settled on the Roman Empire's borders, trading goods from the land and serving as skilled soldiers in the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "In the play Twelfth Night, it suggests that while disguises can be effective tools for sustaining prolonged deception, ultimately, one must abandon these false identities to avoid losing their true selves. However, ending a deception can lead to feelings of alienation. Ultimately, a person must choose between self-preservation and maintaining relationships with those around them. Some may react indifferently upon discovering they've been deceived, while others may take offense at the deception. The issue of deception in gender role reversal brings additional complexities, most notably questioning why someone would feel compelled to abandon their own identity to adopt that of the opposite gender. For Viola, it is clearly a means of self-protection: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Upon arriving in an unfamiliar place, Viola finds it necessary to disguise herself as a man to ensure her safety from potential threats. Her plan succeeds, but it also isolates her from other women, severing her from a crucial support network. Complicating matters further, Viola's male disguise is so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and inadvertently falls in love with her, as shown by Olivia's plea: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, Viola must navigate her own repressed romantic feelings towards Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261). While this situation might seem progressive, modern readers might view Twelfth Night as a depiction of how deception can uncover hidden emotions, particularly for Olivia and Orsino. Certain sections suggest that these characters might have unspoken desires that Viola/Cesario’s presence compels them to confront. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because she perceives him as a man, or does she secretly have feelings for women? One might argue against this, as Shakespeare's portrayal of Olivia seems to satirize those of his era who judge others solely on appearance. This is demonstrated by how easily Olivia shifts her romantic interest from Cesario to Sebastian, eventually seeing Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German colonial rule has been characterized by many as particularly harsh, especially concerning the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in what was then German South West Africa. However, it's overly simplistic to describe an entire colonial empire with a single broad stroke. The policies and governance of the German colonial empire were as diverse as the territories it encompassed. Similarly, the educational systems varied across the colonies. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (now Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a significant number of educated and literate Africans. German efforts in education within Kamerun and other colonies received commendation from writers of the era. The scenario in South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) was notably different. Unlike East Africa, where the government established state schools and actively participated in educating the local population, in South West Africa, education for the natives was largely left to missionary groups with minimal government assistance. However, the government heavily invested in the education of Europeans in the region, setting up state schools and providing more substantial support and regulation for missionary schools. These policies continued to impact South West Africa long after German rule ended. While other German colonies had significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to the unique circumstances of South West Africa. This paper aims to delve into these factors, with a focus on recent research regarding the perspectives of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans. There is an extensive body of literature specifically addressing education in the German colonial empire. Most of these works, written in German during or shortly after the colonial period, aimed to describe the educational systems in these colonies. Later English-language studies expanded the conversation by comparing educational systems across different German colonies and analyzing specific educational aspects in greater detail. These studies highlighted significant differences between the colonies' educational systems. Cohen's work, a prominent study, explicitly addresses the theme of this paper by comparing the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa and discussing the factors accounting for their differences. According to Cohen, the large European settler population in South West Africa explains many of the unique features of its educational system. Compared to Germany's other colonies, South West Africa had a somewhat temperate climate, despite much of its land being arid desert. The European population reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans resided in South West Africa, while the next largest settler population was in East Africa, with only 5,336 Europeans.",
            "The United States and Mexico are examples of two countries that experienced a long-standing rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The peak of this conflict was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, gaining Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Numerous other conflicts occurred between the two nations, eventually subsiding just before World War I. The rivalry was fueled by clashes over key issues such as religion, culture, tradition, and significant material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis situation is similar to that of many other countries that have enduring rivalries with neighboring nations. Countries that share borders often experience conflicts of interest that lead to rival positions. The United States and Mexico are similar to many enduring rivalries between nations that share a common border. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, both of these countries are geographically close to the United States and have historically been rivals, while other Latin American countries have enjoyed good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences created a division between the two nations, a common issue throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). Similar to the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was both an ideological struggle and a competition over vital interests, the conflict here was based not on political structures but on religious preferences. This distrust stemmed from historical tensions between the English and Spanish, which were inherited from their former colonial rulers and posed a significant challenge in establishing friendly foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identified 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry. Most of these disputes, as described by Diehl and Goerts, involved territorial issues, such as border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier problems. Raids by bandits and outlaws into American border towns were a significant issue until both the United States and Mexico used military force to secure their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). Schmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry began to fade as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and concluded as American ambitions shifted \"from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p. 110) in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was unexpectedly and suddenly disabled by an illness I had never heard of. At that time, I was a nurse, a career I chose because of a strong desire for the safety and security I lacked during childhood. I often heard the saying, \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick,\" as I grew up. Even though my aspirations were to become a scientist or journalist—or perhaps a bit of both—I opted for nursing.\n\nNonetheless, there I was at 46 years old, single, with little savings and unable to work. I am still disabled today, and after 15 years of relying on Social Security Disability, I have almost nothing left that I can call my own. I manage to get by, but every day is a challenge, threatening my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Nothing in my life is predictable anymore, yet one thing remains true: I wouldn't have survived all these years without the support of my family and a few good friends, no matter how strong I believed myself to be. When true disaster hits, you don't feel strong at all.\n\nMy point is that emergencies, both big and small, are inevitable in life. There are no guarantees, and despite our best preparations, some challenges are too great to face alone.\n\nI completely agree that in the U.S., we should stop relying solely on big government, which is clearly deteriorating and ineffective. However, I would much prefer to see Americans learning to trust and assist one another and asking for help, rather than each of us individually retreating to build fallout shelters.\n\nConservatives in the U.S. often speak about the \"rugged individualism\" that built the nation, but truthfully, what sustained our ancestors during tough times was not rugged individualism but rather compassion, mutual respect, and resource sharing. The pioneers who journeyed across the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, definitely be prepared—I am. I have a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, plastic sheeting, and duct tape for windows in case of a biological attack. I own several flashlights, various batteries, plenty of candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and can preserve your own food, go for it. It's an excellent idea, as is having a wood stove, as long as you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while doing all this, make sure to get to know your neighbors.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born who would later be known as Buddha. Throughout his life, he gave up worldly possessions, achieved enlightenment, and his teachings laid the groundwork for Buddhism. The most traditional branch of this religion is called Theravada Buddhism. Buddhism has existed for about 2,500 years, and it has evolved since the time of Buddha. This evolution is evident in places like Sri Lanka, a Theravada Buddhist country, where the annual water-cutting ceremony takes place. This ceremony, involving both monks and laypeople, holds religious significance despite not being directly taught by Buddha. Changes in Buddhism range from surface-level traditions to the fundamental beliefs about salvation. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community, including both monastic and lay members, has had to adapt its principles due to various influences. These influences can be external or internal and can be either harmful or neutral. \n\nIn this discussion, several key terms will be used frequently. \"Internal\" forces originate within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic status, while \"external\" forces come from non-Buddhists. A \"hostile\" force is one that harms or intends to harm the Buddhist community due to negative views of Buddhism. A \"benign\" force neither aims to harm nor help the community but may inadvertently do one or the other. These terms will be referenced repeatedly.\n\nInitially, it's crucial to understand the fundamentals of the religion—the core doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma primarily comprises the Tripitaka, or the three baskets, of Buddhist writings. The Sutta Pitaka contains the discourses, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the monastic rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka includes the philosophical aspects of Buddhism. These philosophical aspects involve concepts like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (life's inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). By understanding these ideas, one can end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. Enlightenment brings an end to Sansara along with lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for life. Laypeople adhere to five precepts: not to kill, lie, steal, engage in sexual misconduct, or take intoxicants. Monks follow many more rules. The fundamental doctrinal concept in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths: first, the truth that life is suffering (Dukkha); second, that attachment causes suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome."
