            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture plays a crucial role in negotiations. It can be as much about what it is not as what it is and what it represents. Culture is neither uniform nor a singular entity. Generalizations such as \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While it’s useful to understand cultural generalizations, negotiators benefit more from grasping the significance of culture on the issue at hand and how cultural attitudes might influence discussions. When encountering a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that relates to their own culture, naturally leading to comparisons.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset may involve studying its history or recognizing its biases. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, one should accept it and work within its parameters, particularly in negotiations, especially if one is negotiating from a weaker position. Similarly, when a negotiator is in unfamiliar territory, respecting traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and progress the negotiation.\n\nIt is essential to recognize that culture doesn't solely exist on a national or international level. Companies within a nation often develop their own corporate cultures. For example, a corporate culture might prioritize long office hours or a more flexible schedule. Corporate culture can be observed in employee dress codes, communication styles (direct versus indirect communication, delegation of responsibilities), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, while others limit it to \"company-approved\" charities or fundraisers. Variations in American corporate culture from company to company (and even within different regions, urban versus suburban environments) highlight the diversity of thought within a societal culture. Certain cultures may seem less stratified than American culture and appear more uniform to outsiders, but this similarity invites deeper exploration.\n\nUnderstanding values is even more important, as they explain the reasons behind a culture. If saving face or maintaining communal harmony is valued, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superior to succeed in negotiations. Similarly, a negotiator from a culture that values hard bargaining won't necessarily rush to settle. Considering these generalities is crucial before negotiating. However, learning about one's opponent on a personal level enhances the effectiveness of negotiations.",
            "The phrase \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God,’\" first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and serves as the starting point for St. Anselm's argument about God's existence. This perspective is also shared by Thomas Aquinas, another author under discussion. Since both argue in favor of the same idea, and our task is to evaluate which argument is stronger, we must assume, for simplicity, that both are correct in their belief in the existence of the God depicted in the Bible. Considering a different type of deity would not allow for a fair comparison of their arguments, as both authors essentially defend a specific concept of God. With that in mind, I propose that while each presents valid points, neither offers a comprehensive foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo support this assertion, we will first look at St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm's passage suggests a path to understanding through faith, by introspection to find evidence of God. He argues that since God exists within our comprehension, we cannot truly imagine His nonexistence. Although his terminology can be lengthy and somewhat unclear, the main idea is that the proof of God resides in one's own mind. St. Anselm implies that we do not need to look beyond ourselves to discover the truth about God; His existence is evident by examining what we inherently know to be true within our minds. External evidence is presumably unnecessary. This acceptance of something without irrefutable empirical evidence is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nThis concept contrasts with that of St. Thomas Aquinas, who argues that God's existence can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, without relying on faith. This approach could be advantageous for evangelism, a key aspect of Christianity, as it would allow for the conversion of new believers based solely on logic, without requiring acceptance of unprovable claims. St. Thomas presents five logical arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each, he essentially shows that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for His existence. Just as you can deduce the characteristics and existence of a missing puzzle piece without seeing it, logic dictates that God's existence can be inferred.",
            "Various authors employ diverse methods to evoke specific emotions or attitudes in their readers regarding significant topics, and some techniques prove more effective than others. In his novel, The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald employs several such methods. Occasionally, he combines an adjective and a noun in unusual pairings to create a particular atmosphere surrounding a subject. At other times, he assigns symbolic meaning to an object and uses it for the same purpose. Fitzgerald extensively uses this technique with colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, he imbues colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, with specific meanings, which he later uses to evoke certain feelings associated with important elements.\n\nFitzgerald associates white/gray with uniformity, where white suggests a more refined and upper-class quality, while gray conveys an older and faded aspect. He establishes these meanings early in the novel through frequent references. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are consistently described as being \"in white\" (8)—indeed, almost everyone is depicted in white: Nick attends Gatsby's party in \"white flannels\" (41), Tom wears a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only exception is when Nick observes Gatsby's party, where \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further defines these colors by associating them with mundane or insignificant subjects: as Nick heads to work, he travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the guest list at Gatsby's parties becomes \"gray names\" (61) on Nick’s timetable, and Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—indicating uniformity (28). He also uses white or gray to describe ordinary people or locations: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" at the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established the significance of white/gray, he employs them to indicate unimportance or uniformity in certain subjects. This use of color symbolism begins with Daisy. After a period without notable mentions of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" prompting readers to perceive her as less of an individual character and more as a uniform object, something Gatsby desires (74). Fitzgerald continues to use this color symbolism around Daisy to reinforce the notion of her as a uniform addition, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18), and once again, she is in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",

This type of operation enables landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitats, allowing for recreational use and creating opportunities for farm tours and educational programs. \n\nOrganic farming presents a lucrative niche market and often leads to increased biodiversity in plants and wildlife, as it avoids using chemicals in the soil and water. However, it can be more costly than conventional farming due to the need for more labor and management to control pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals. Organic farms tend to experience higher losses and lack the economies of scale of larger operations. Practices beneficial to wildlife, though not exclusively tied to organic farming, may also involve higher labor costs, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, removing invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create specific conditions like edge habitats or open ground patches. Therefore, the landowner in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land chosen for this scenario is a 160-acre parcel near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It includes chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This area is part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion under the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan, currently under review, considers over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, while others like burrowing owls are declining and may soon be listed.\n\nHistorically, this area was inhabited by Native Americans for countless generations and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The land was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing or wood production over the decades. To explore realistic options for a small farmer to reduce costs and maintain wildlife-friendly practices, I selected a property from a real estate website and researched available government programs. As an example of what farming this land might entail, I identified an organic farm in the same area.",
            "The connection between brothers is a powerful and unyielding bond, filled with a myriad of emotions such as love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers possess a deep understanding of each other, unmatched by any other relationship, and see themselves reflected in one another. It is in moments of crisis that the true essence of this bond is revealed, whether for better or worse. The clarity of these emotions comes at a significant cost, and part of comprehending them involves facing the consequences they bring. When a brother gazes into another's eyes and sees his own likeness, he perceives himself not as others do, but as he truly is. The essence of their character is found in their actions and the repercussions of those actions. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme and the turbulent emotions it entails. Against a richly described backdrop, these boys embark on a hopeless journey. The climactic scene sees deep disappointment collide with fierce pride, resulting in only one brother surviving. The theme is conveyed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator’s perspective, which communicates the complex emotions the protagonist experiences and his perception of the world, both of which strongly influence his actions. The protagonist’s behavior is driven by one central emotion: pride. From his first outings with his younger brother, Doodle, to their final, tragic adventure, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He desired a brother to whom he could impart all his worldly skills, like \"...holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He longed for a companion to race to Horsehead Landing and to accompany him atop the great pine behind the barn. However, Doodle's condition made these dreams impossible. Born with a frail heart, Doodle's survival was uncertain, and engaging in strenuous physical activity was nearly out of the question. This was a heavy blow to the young protagonist, whose head was filled with grand fantasies, only to see them shattered in an instant. In fact, he even admits to feeling anger towards the child, recalling thoughts of suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would contemplate such an act? Yet, his heart softens when the child smiles at him, a simple gesture that filled him with hope. This suggests that his intent was not strong, as deep down, he had an innate love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex and imaginative system for processing information. As technology evolved from basic to advanced, the metaphors used to describe the brain also changed. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, followed by a book, and most recently, a computer. When studying the brain, it is important to remember that these metaphors have limitations and can lead to incorrect assumptions.  \nInformation processing begins with input from sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light photons into electrochemical signals. The brain’s algorithms repeatedly transform this sensory information through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles basic details such as color, orientation, and object borders—where color changes sharply in a small area—to determine that a box is being seen. Top-down processing leverages decisions made during bottom-up processing to expedite recognizing the box. In this scenario, top-down processing might help identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped void in the white background.  \nAfter a certain level of processing, an attention filter determines the significance of the signal and which cognitive processes should access it. For example, though your brain processes each blade of grass when you glance at your shoes, a functioning attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. Conversely, you might notice your name even amid a noisy environment. There are several stages of processing, and attention continuously influences the results.  \nFor the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, with specific encoding methods for each type of sensory input. For example, verbal input can be encoded based on its structure—what the printed word looks like, phonemically—what the word sounds like, or semantically—what the word means. Once stored, information must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which retains information for about 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal cycling through a specific series of neurons for a short duration. Information in long-term memory is believed to be preserved in the structure of certain protein types.  \nThere are various models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, some derived from how humans recall memories, others from computer science, and still others from neurophysiology. The semantic network model suggests that concepts are represented by nodes, which are interconnected based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which could be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a severe financial crisis. Unemployment surged, the housing market collapsed, and numerous significant American corporations were devastated. This recession continues today, prompting us to ask: what caused this crisis, and how can it be prevented? Essentially, the crisis was the result of self-serving and shortsighted political decisions that compelled banks and companies to issue sub-prime loans within a fragile financial framework. At the same time, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and bundle these mortgages into complex financial instruments like CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves and passed the turmoil onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold, impacting the wider economy.\n\nThe crisis's origins trace back to 1999 during Clinton's presidency, as he sought re-election by boosting his popularity. To achieve this, the Clinton administration eased lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999 that \"Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes accurately predicted the potential fallout: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As highlighted earlier, and as Holmes anticipated, reckless lending would inevitably lead to economic collapse.\n\nVarious factors contributed to the economic downturn, one being the novel and intricate mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were heavily utilized in the years preceding the crisis, further entangling more economic sectors with the housing market. This led U.S. households and financial markets to overextend themselves in the housing sector, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nUltimately, the housing bubble burst, and financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities suffered. In 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts, accounting for about 30% of the nation’s GDP. As a result, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at low prices, Lehman Brothers was disbanded, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to convert into commercial banks under strict regulation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That point in your narrative where you spread your writerly wings and soar, mesmerizing everyone with your captivating, even enchanting, prose. Or it's the moment when your readers doze off or hit the \"Back\" button, cursing your name. Dr. Merlin is known to yell at her screen when she encounters an overload of information, and not in a pleasant way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy gentle readers are familiar with the fundamental writing advice, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself in extensive sections of text where nothing, or too much, occurs. Exposition is the mischievous imp whispering to you to dispense with the history to reach the exciting parts (not to be mistaken for the imp on the other shoulder urging the author to divulge every detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition involves informing the audience of what happened, usually in straightforward prose. In film, exposition occurs when one character relays a deluge of information to another, much like in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author conveying the details.\n\nAn example might help. While reading a story, you learn that the heroine met her beloved at a particular place and time, they wed in grand fashion, and her husband was murdered before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to span two pages with each having only two lines of dialogue. You'd anticipate the author spending time on the husband's character, illustrating through his words and actions how deeply he loves his wife. Similarly, you would expect the heroine to demonstrate, through various means, how much his presence transformed and enriched her life (especially if the story later explicitly states this). Properly introducing the husband's character would enable you to become emotionally invested in his fate, providing insight into the heroine's character: what drew her to him, the depth of their bond, clues about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as seen through his eyes, and so on. You would grieve his death alongside her, thereby deepening your connection to the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you'd expect substance on the bare storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your responsibility to add that substance. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, continues*) There's often a temptation to gloss over certain details. Maybe you're introducing a new character and you know he was in the Air Force, he's the night manager of a gas station now, he's been married twice, has no kids, enjoys fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was a live broadcast from NBC 4 on the morning of August 13, 2011. The main story covered a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. They didn't mention her name but showed his mugshot, describing him as looking quite menacing. The report was brief, lasting about two minutes, as the story was still developing. The only details provided were that he had stabbed her several times and had been arrested. I felt the coverage was appropriately timed.\n\nThe second story involved an early morning shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area, leaving him critically injured with no arrests or suspects identified at that time. The SWAT Team was investigating. This story also seemed short, possibly because it involved a black man or was set in a predominantly black neighborhood. I've noticed for years that crimes involving minority victims often receive less attention. If the victim is a white child or adult, the media tends to give it much more coverage.\n\nThe next report was about a gunshot hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. They shared details about where they believed the incident occurred and determined it was hit by a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nAnother story was about predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to stay in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. This segment was brief, likely meant as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nThey also reported on a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie, approximately six feet tall and weighing around 150 pounds. I felt they spent an unusual amount of time focusing on his race and skin color.\n\nAnother story covered Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin found guilty of conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, they mentioned his sentence as \"300 months\" instead of 25 years, which seemed to emphasize the severity. They also noted he was Hispanic, though it didn't seem relevant to the case.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of security intended to follow an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund, but it offers more flexibility and can be traded like a stock on an exchange. An ETF provides the diversification benefits of an index fund along with the advantages of owning individual stocks, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as little as one share per transaction. Despite these appealing features, ETFs have significantly lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund. However, there are some drawbacks, such as the necessity to pay a commission for any ETF trade, akin to a stock order. Another advantage of ETFs is the vast array of funds available. While these benefits are clearly outlined, a prudent financial investor should assess whether the stated benefits, such as diversification, truly exist and to what degree. For this purpose, we will analyze the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to see if the advantages of owning a single ETF are comparable to those of holding a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, and whether there are better configurations of the same stocks that could offer a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo assess the ETF, it would be cumbersome to include every holding, so we have opted to consider only the top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF. Listed below are the top 10 holdings and their percentage of total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF overall, we can use the current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate each stock's contribution to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio consisted solely of these 10 stocks in the proportions set by the ETF's holdings. The calculations of Beta and return are shown in the chart below.\n\nThe chart indicates that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than that of the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. It also shows that the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole. Based on the results so far, it appears that a portfolio composed of just the top 10 holdings could yield a higher return with a lower beta. Nevertheless, there is a chance that the means of these two portfolios might not be statistically different.\n\nTo evaluate whether these portfolios differ statistically, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is calculated and normalized to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, the third month of the project saw a sharp decline in commuter log submissions, which was somewhat discouraging, and the reasons for this are not entirely clear. The arrival of winter on a New England campus likely led to fewer people commuting by bike or on foot, possibly explaining part of the downturn. December is also the end of the fall semester, a time when everyone is busy with completing assignments, grading, and other tasks, so keeping up with the commuter log might not have been a priority. Additionally, December ushers in the bustling holiday season and a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many do not need to be on campus. Classes resume in late January for the spring semester, which could also explain the low log numbers for that month. However, this doesn't clarify the low submissions in February. It might be that such projects initially generate enthusiasm that naturally wanes over time. To counteract this, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a focused campaign that did boost log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the key challenges we faced was maintaining project momentum amid a natural decline in engagement and the specific disruptions caused by holidays and semester breaks in higher education.\n\nAnother challenge of this project, or any alternative commuting initiative, is that people cherish the freedom, independence, and flexibility associated with driving their own cars, which is deeply ingrained in our culture. Therefore, offering incentives to encourage alternative commuting is crucial. We distributed numerous prizes like gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, a local bookstore, and some larger national chains. It would have been interesting to see how offering even larger prizes might have influenced participation—such as awarding a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car, which might have helped address the engagement drop. The nature of the prizes remained consistent throughout the project. However, if the value of the prizes had increased over time, it might have made a difference. The gift cards were quite effective at the beginning, but announcing in December that we were adding a couple of bicycles, and in January a hybrid or electric car, could potentially have increased participation and engagement rather than seeing a decline.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all fifteen trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films typically utilize creative editing techniques to create illusions. My analysis focused on describing the artistic elements of most trick films and identifying unique evolutionary features in some of the later ones. Generally, trick films from the turn of the century are confined to a set, framed within a frontal proscenium, with no camera movement, using long and medium shots, and following a strict one shot per film approach. However, some films from the early 1900s deviate from these norms by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne common feature of these trick films is their filming within an interior set framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, not moving to follow characters or objects. This style was prevalent in early films, drawing inspiration from theater and, specifically for trick films, from vaudeville and magic shows. A drawback of using a stage setup is that characters in trick films typically only move laterally, without approaching or retreating from the camera. For instance, in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), actors enter from the right and move horizontally. Even as they exit the frame, the camera remains static.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition also results in predominantly long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-ups are absent in Edison’s trick films, reflecting the theater and vaudeville tradition where audiences saw the complete performance within the stage's borders. In early films, actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, eliminating the need for close-ups.\n\nMost early trick films adhere to a pattern where one conceptual shot equals a film. This restricts their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used, and limits their dramatic or narrative potential. They mainly focus on brief, vaudeville-style tricks like magic and disappearing acts with minimal story. However, in a trick film, what appears as one conceptual shot to the viewer might involve multiple physical shots combined to create illusions of appearance or disappearance. For example, in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), careful observation reveals the transition point to the physical shot featuring Mary's severed \"head,\" even though the film appears as a single conceptual shot to the audience.",
            "Ian Watt refers to the classic \"Gothic Novel\" as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" in his work, The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic style has been both criticized and celebrated, accused of lacking depth, yet praised for its 'terrible sublime' quality, as noted by Burke. Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the first \"Gothic Novel,\" merged elements of both \"ancient and modern\" romances to craft the early Gothic genre, introducing a novel literary expression. Walpole combined \"old\" theatrical techniques with 'new' naturalistic elements found in 'modern' novels to present what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre incorporates many aspects reminiscent of medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and customs. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, \"gothic\" described various peoples, styles, and eras, often seen as outdated or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The blend of theatrical \"Gothic\" elements with the novel's new format, which offers a more intimate view of characters' psychology, has allowed Gothic literature to endure over time, simultaneously appearing obsolete and fresh to readers far removed from its original context.\n\nA key gothic theme in Gothic novels is Chivalry. The medieval concept of chivalry, which involved training a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry holds particular significance for Gothic authors because it symbolizes the classic knight—brave, honorable, competent—and the perceived absence of these ideals in society, as observed by writers like Walpole. By employing chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, foreshadowing the Gothic's evolution into Romanticism and serving as an attempt to better the present. When Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto, he was amidst political turmoil and concerned about the future. Immersed in politics and possibly facing unjust accusations, he may have believed, even if subconsciously, that the perceived morality and inherent \"goodness\" of people from the gothic era were missing in contemporary society. This notion is evident in several characters, including Frederic. Before meeting Frederic, the reader learns that he possesses many chivalric qualities; he is depicted as a prince who has endured suffering, been profoundly affected by tragedy, and is presumed to have been killed by infidels. The portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, naturally, exaggerated, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the series of processes involved in moving goods from a customer's order through the stages of raw material acquisition, supply, production, and distribution until they reach the customer. The concept of supply chain management was introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver. He explained the comprehensive process of planning, executing, and controlling supply chain activities to meet customer needs efficiently and promptly. The supply chain consists of six fundamental components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nProduction is the initial phase of the supply chain process and serves as the foundation for the entire operation. This stage involves determining when, why, where, and how products will be manufactured. Managers must understand customer preferences, which can be gauged by analyzing market trends. The market offers insights into customer demands, enabling managers to decide what products to produce and in what quantities. Once these decisions are made, managers then determine the best location and facility for production, considering volume and quality requirements while ensuring customer satisfaction. After selecting the production site, managers focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Effective planning is crucial, as overlooking details can lead to significant time and financial losses. For instance, my experience working at Walmart and Target highlighted the importance of having structured processes, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments, which helps streamline operations and set clear expectations.\n\nThe second crucial component in supply chain management is supply. Supply involves making strategic decisions that define a facility's core capabilities and determine the growth of outsourcing partnerships. A company might have various production divisions for a single product, each with unique equipment, personnel, and expertise. Managers must choose the most suitable division for each stage of the production process. Sometimes, outsourcing to other companies is considered to enhance efficiency. The primary motivation for outsourcing is to achieve velocity, which is the ability to deliver quality and flexibility while minimizing or maintaining low costs.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous detail and focus on the aristocracy of the era. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, while considered Victorian, deviate from this norm. These novels incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, which are not typical of the time, to enhance their characters by offering deeper insights into their motivations and emotions.\n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels often utilize mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike experiences, although the content and purpose differ in each case. In Oliver Twist, such strange occurrences often reveal insights into Oliver’s inner struggles, his suffering, and his understanding of the reality around him. When the incident of Oliver being shot is revisited in chapter 28, he relives it vividly, almost like a dream, while he seeks assistance. This passage highlights the lack of control Oliver had over the events, as well as the severity of his health condition, reflected in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing his senses so much that he is unaware of the “unseen hand” that carries him away; he relives his despair, detached from the initial shock of pain, as it has become constant and associated with fear rather than surprise. Oliver’s overwhelming experience raises the question of whose will led to his misfortune, as it certainly wasn’t his own. This incident reinforces the idea that Oliver has little control over anything, unable to even attempt to influence the outcome of events, even when his life is at stake. This selection suggests a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if old Fagin has begun to break him, compelling him to accept his despair and affecting his ability to respond. Otherwise, it is implied that Oliver would have made some effort to save himself.\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.",
            "A few years back, I worked in an after-school program where I tutored elementary students. I tried to assist them with any subject they found difficult, although my expertise was in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to help a young boy named Adrian, who was in either third or fourth grade and was struggling with reading. I noticed something unusual; while he could pronounce some letters perfectly, others were a complete mystery to him. It was quite odd. Adrian, who was of Latino heritage, spoke flawless English, which puzzled me. We continued to face challenges until I met his mother. I was watching over a few students who stayed behind while the rest of the group went on a field trip when she arrived. Adrian's mother spoke only Spanish, not a word of English. Despite my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate. It suddenly became clear to me: Adrian could read well but didn't know the English alphabet very thoroughly. I'm not sure if this realization helped him significantly, but I hope he's doing better now. \n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issue in schools, particularly in California. It also illustrates that the problem isn't always apparent. Even a child who speaks perfect English can find reading it a formidable challenge. We can all agree that this issue exists, but what can be done? In Adrian's case, the answer was relatively straightforward: tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children who barely speak English, the solution is more complicated. There's no single answer. The key is in combining various approaches like the dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes. \n\nThe dual language system is an excellent concept, not just for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Research shows that children in bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Some fear that it's a waste of resources and won't benefit most students, but that's not true. If we made such programs the norm rather than the exception, all children would gain from them. How should we implement this? Should we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that would be impractical. However, there's no reason we can't have special aides or tutors who are bilingual.",
            "From a young age, many of us are taught that there exists something larger and more incomprehensible than ourselves. Some attend Sunday school to learn about it, others go to Temple, or seek answers within themselves. Many accept the religious beliefs passed down by their parents, while some reject these beliefs, insisting that nothing exists beyond their personal, self-centered world. We might adopt one belief system only to later replace it with another. Regardless of the path we take, we strive to define ourselves through our individual views on spirituality, searching for guidance to lead us from darkness to light.\n\n\"My favorite bird is a cardinal,\" my father replied when I asked him. We were sitting on our front porch, listening to the rain drumming on the tin roof, sharing a cigarette. The gutters poured water, drowning the plants lining the porch. He gazed into the rain, his look a mix of searching and reminiscing. Over the past months, he had lost weight, and his clothes hung loosely on him. His hair had thinned too, more than I remembered. He kept looking at the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt isolated, scared, unable to express how much I would miss him, as speaking about it would make it all too real. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer to his, and joined him in watching the rain fall in the June twilight.\n\nMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation did not alleviate his suffering but extended his life a few months beyond the doctors' expectations; I couldn't understand the value in prolonging his suffering. What kind of God would allow this, I wondered. Alone at night, I didn't pray; I felt that if God existed, he had long since stopped listening to me.\n\nI didn't want to witness his transition from this life to the next, so I didn't. I couldn't bear to watch the life that brought me into the world as it ended. I wanted to remember my father for how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew him better than anyone else, and I was certain he wouldn't want his only child to witness his death. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an enthusiastic early supporter of Republicanism. Despite being mainly an agriculturist, his profession and brief political career made him known for his commitment and vocal stance on personal freedom and governance. His belief in an agrarian system shaped nearly all his views on government. He sought to uphold and promote what he saw as the most noble profession, influencing his thoughts on sovereignty, constitutional matters, and the judiciary.\n\nTaylor saw that the United States had a unique chance to develop an ideal system since there were no entrenched traditions to constrain the founders, enabling them to create a system of self-governance. He was a strong advocate for natural rights, viewing them as interconnected—if one is denied, they all become compromised, reducing their significance. Thus, these rights should be out of government’s reach. He argued that the so-called \"state of nature\" allowed those with physical strength and cunning to thrive, but civilization should not follow this pattern.\n\nFor Taylor, building this ideal society required a government that acknowledged both the good and evil in people. He held a firm belief in dualistic morality, stating, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). Good principles, he claimed, were those that protected private property, enhanced agriculture, and resisted capitalism. A government grounded in these principles would operate justly regardless of its leadership, which would inevitably be driven by greed and self-interest. He saw self-interest as a universal human motivator but considered it negative only when it led to factions that thrived at others’ expense. A good government was essential to curb humanity’s inherent evil, and even then, it required vigilant oversight to prevent the adoption of harmful principles.\n\nLike many firm Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a highly restricted Federal government, limited to the powers explicitly granted by the Constitution. A large Federal government, he believed, was costly and prone to tyranny. However, he thought a simplistic literal reading was risky, potentially corrupt without considering the framers’ intentions. He regarded the Declaration of Independence as the true foundation of the United States, as it more clearly defined the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "I stared down, my mind blankly absorbing the scene before me. Without emotion or sound, I observed with a practiced eye, one that analyzed without connecting the subject to any abstract ideas. Thoughts flickered in and out of my mind so quickly it felt as if I had no real thoughts of my own, only a fluid experience of what I saw. Once, following advice from an artist I knew, I bought an art instruction book titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had wanted to learn to draw since I was six, and this book taught everything from the basics of a pencil to how the brain processes lines. One technique it suggested was to use a square frame to focus on any picture the artist wanted to study. This way, a complex scene, like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen opening to a dining room, could be simplified to just the bowl of fruit on a plain surface. At the time, as I looked down at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't imagine framing it like an artist. I was too overwhelmed, too amazed, that I could only stand there in awe. Picasso had his blue period, Monet loved greenery, and the Italian Renaissance masters used a spectrum of colors. If I dared to consider my perspective as artistic, this was the start of my picture, my story, Work in Brown. My fingers touched my chosen tool, muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand moved, my mind's intention taking form in what could have been my most creative moment. Water swirled, serene and clear. Bits of matter broke away and disappeared. Muscles tightened, my hand striking the toilet handle again with more urgency. The unpleasant brown mass wouldn't budge, stuck to the bottom like a slug. Holding the mop loosely, feet a foot apart, and a green tie uncomfortably snug around my neck, I frowned at the unpleasant heap of processed matter left as a message for those who cleaned the Rite Aid bathrooms. After a few more flushes and quiet, reflective moments, my hand reached for the toilet paper, wrapped around until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing straight, then bending at the waist, my hand lowered into the bowl like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "Teenagers are losing their lives in car accidents. Several factors contribute to this alarming trend among the youngest drivers in America. According to the National Institutes of Health, one issue is that the adolescent brain is not yet equipped to handle the dangers of driving. Inexperience is also a key factor, leading not only to more fatal crashes but also to an increased prevalence of vehicle rollovers, speeding incidents, and cars veering off the road. Teen drivers are particularly at risk when traveling with friends, a common occurrence as anyone with common sense might expect. Research by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a link between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents. \n\nTo enhance teen driver safety, California and other states have implemented temporary provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and ban other minors as passengers. However, I see these provisional licenses as temporary solutions. The fundamental problem is that, statistically, the youngest drivers are not yet capable of managing the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 may be too young for a standard driver's license. USA Today highlights Zuckerman's research, which shows that individuals under 19-20 often engage in risky behavior for excitement. Delaying driving until this thrill-seeking tendency diminishes seems logical. Continuing to issue licenses to young teens will likely result in more fatal accidents, with the death toll potentially soaring in the coming years. By 2010, the children of Baby Boomers will reach driving age, adding millions of new teen drivers to the roads.\n\nAddressing this issue through legislation would be relatively straightforward. Schools could still provide driver's education to prepare future drivers, but individuals under 18 would not be allowed to drive. A provisional permit could be granted before a full driver's license, with a requirement for a specific number of practical driving hours. This number could align with the current requirements in most states (such as California's requirement of six hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult). Since the troubling statistics for teen drivers are consistent across all states, a unified national law would be a sensible and effective approach to safeguarding teens nationwide. The legislation I propose is not entirely new.",
            "This paper explores three facets of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, it offers a concise definition of the disorder. It then discusses the diagnosis process, highlighting typical traits or \"red flags.\" Lastly, it suggests methods a teacher in a mainstream classroom can use to support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is concerned with how effectively and efficiently the central nervous system (CNS) uses auditory information. In a more specific sense, (C)AP involves the perceptual processing of auditory data within the CNS and the neurobiological activity that supports this processing, leading to electrophysiologic auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it is a disorder where the brain struggles to properly process auditory information. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally and are not classified as \"hearing impaired\"; instead, the brain region responsible for interpreting sounds, distinguishing words, or separating conversation from background noise does not operate as expected.\n\nThe concept that eventually became CAPD was first mentioned in the mid-1950s as “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), when researchers were examining children with communication disorders. An Italian research team led by Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started developing tests for these children in 1954, and in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and created a model to explain the central auditory nervous system's physiology relevant to dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 spurred further research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD can present in various ways: affected individuals might struggle to locate or hear sound spatially, differentiate between multiple sound occurrences, recognize sound patterns, detect changes in speech tone (like sarcasm), have one sound blocked by another, lack the ability to interpret sound cues meaningfully, and be unable to discern the sequence in which auditory information is delivered (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,\" performed by audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and other professionals using diverse measures to assess auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires, surveys, and observing auditory responses to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single tool or test that consistently achieves a high diagnostic success rate, and the disorder has no known cause. Many tests challenge the patient with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli, requiring them to differentiate items like a sequence of words or numbers. More advanced tests might involve recording acoustic signals in the ear and measuring responses to these signals.",
            "In my pursuit of a social work education, I aim to establish a career with the Division of Family and Children Services to support children who have faced abuse or neglect and to assist families in distress. The values I bring to the social work profession include service, respect, ethics, dedication to enhancing interpersonal relationships, and a commitment to my professional development to ensure my competence. These values are crucial not only to social workers but also to me personally.\n\nI have always had a desire to help others, although I was uncertain about which career path to take. During my high school and college years, I observed many people avoiding their problems or using poor coping strategies. Witnessing these situations led me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of my career direction, I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy at her home. She explained that he was there to escape his abusive parents. The following day, I found out he had contacted the police about his parents. I went to his parents’ house to see if I could assist. I privately expressed my concerns to the police and mentioned my recent Psychology degree. The police asked me to speak with the parents since the law couldn't intervene for the teenager. When I talked to the parents, they appeared uneasy and gave excuses about their son’s “manipulative” behavior in involving outsiders for \"simple\" family issues. This experience prompted me to seriously consider a career in social work to aid children with family “disputes.”\n\nAnother essential value in social work is social justice. While society claims to value individuals and mourns those we've lost, the societal concept of the “individual” is more about adhering to outdated traditions than embracing uniqueness. If we mourn lost individuals, why do we strive to conform to be like \"everyone else?\" I see myself as an individual and refuse to limit myself to conform. During my high school and college years, I consistently opposed social injustice: by dyeing my hair in unconventional colors, wearing clothes that expressed my personality, getting multiple ear piercings, joining the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and actively fighting against racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. I believe in social justice and will continue to oppose social injustice.",
            "This paper explores the Biological and Sociocultural models concerning the disorder of insomnia. The biological model emphasizes genetic inheritance and medical health aspects, while the Sociocultural models consider environmental interactions and their relevance to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The review of insomnia presented here examines these models, discussing each chosen research piece to enhance the understanding of the models. The research findings are critiqued, highlighting their particular strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder may be classified as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder linked to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder associated with other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, whereas sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are connected to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorders might result from medical issues or substance use. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in achieving or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is characterized by trouble staying awake, both persisting for at least one month. Narcolepsy is associated with cataplexy and/or automatic REM. Dyssomnias are concerned with initiating and maintaining sleep, whereas Parasomnias involve sleep disorders linked to abnormal behaviors or physiological events. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to other mental disorders involve sleep issues due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily focuses on insomnia and, to some extent, on primary sleep disorders in general, as they relate to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders examines genetic, heritable factors, and physiological aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study using mice found phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons specifically responsible for sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while its inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that animal models in mice can be applied to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence of this receptor could affect one's ability to sleep adequately without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if this phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and any alteration in the receptor could naturally disrupt an individual's sleep. This would negatively impact life aspects such as education, career, and daily activities requiring monotony and focus.",
            "I have been studying at University Park for roughly two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many, including myself. During my freshman year, I lived in a dorm in East Halls, which is nearly the farthest eastern point of campus, apart from the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes, especially in the often poor weather of State College. An alumnus, not much older than me, informed me that not long ago, East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the campus by large areas of unused land. Now, that space is occupied by sports fields, large new buildings like the Creamery and health services building, and surrounded by apartments. As our campus keeps growing, moving from one place to another becomes increasingly difficult. What is the best way to address mobility issues? On a college campus, bicycles are the answer. However, bikes alone aren't enough; students need to use them, and the campus should be designed to accommodate bicyclists' needs.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who started biking again after a break of several years. He remarked that he wondered why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are fantastic,\" he said. \"For a while, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only practical way to get around.\" Besides being beneficial for your health, biking is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off-campus, just as distant from the center as some dorms. The best decision I made this year was purchasing a bike. I have classes in the Thomas building every day, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. Cycling can reduce that time to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. The only issue is that Pollock Road, the most direct route to the Thomas building from my house, isn't always easy to navigate, whether on a bike or not. Walking has its advantages too, but I don't have the time to walk. Without my bike, walking would be my only dependable way to get to class, which would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily routine. That's more than two and a half hours each week, plus additional time spent walking to other classes and appointments. I simply can't afford that much time.",
            "In \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley critiques the looming dangers of technology and capitalism, which support a dystopian society. The novel's society prioritizes community over individuality, with citizens conditioned from birth to seek immediate happiness. These individuals are merely pieces in a larger scheme, restricted to a single ideology controlled by the World Controller. Viewed through a Marxist lens, the book reveals Huxley's skepticism about these systems. Marxist terms like homogeny and reification highlight the novel as a critique of the economic developments of Huxley's era.\n\nCapitalism is lampooned using the Marxist concept of false consciousness, which suggests that ordinary people are unaware of their true economic class relations, focusing instead on personal gain. This results from ideological control over the working class, as depicted by the conditioning in \"Brave New World.\" The lower classes, such as Delta and Gamma, lack genuine autonomy; hypnopædia intensifies their urge to consume and indulge above all else, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, where social classes are entirely dominated by another group, is evident here. The lower classes remain oblivious to their manipulation, essentially buying into an ideology that supports capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes might recognize this manipulation but typically do nothing, with few exceptions like Bernard. The interactions among social classes provide significant insight into the perceived oppression by capitalism.\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" true relationships between individuals are non-existent. The characters, even the main ones, lack depth, suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism robs people of free will and self-expression. Love and strong emotions are absent; interactions are shallow, as shown by men's comments on women's physical traits and women's candid discussions of their encounters. Additionally, each class's satisfaction with its social status reflects capitalism's socioeconomic impact. Their complete obedience within the community aligns with Marxist views on the proletariat, who are misled into believing in their superiority as long as they continue to consume, conform, and align with their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. One of the primary subjects of intense discussion was whether Islam is a hostile religion. I feel this question is more pertinent today than ever. Reflecting on events since 9/11, I have noticed the media's shift from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to a more extreme tolerance for Islam in America. Back in 2001, it would have been unimaginable for a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, whose family has a clear Muslim background, to emerge.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet fascinates me because, based on my knowledge of Muhammad's history, it seems to contradict his personality. Previously, I believed that Muhammad compelled conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and imposing the religion on them. However, the biography portrays Muhammad as a misunderstood martyr who humbled himself before others, leading people to gradually see the 'truth' in his teachings and seek him out.\n\nAdditionally, there are striking parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad. A notable example is when Muhammad multiplied mutton and milk to abundantly feed forty men. This style of writing suggests the authors aimed to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who lived in truth and miracles without needing validation. I find this problematic as it undermines the miracles and life of Jesus Christ, seemingly appropriating Jesus's legacy through Muhammad.\n\nThe biography also includes numerous stories suggesting an agenda to demonstrate 'witness' or show how people independently converted to Islam. The issue is that many stories are relayed from a third-party perspective, with the author narrating tales heard from others. This approach, intended to verify the truth of these stories, instead makes them appear more dubious to me.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a divine man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. However, history challenges the notion of Muhammad as a gentle and humble figure, and I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true historical context of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus during his lifetime were quickly set aside as Christian thought evolved after his death. Observing this history broadly, we notice a pattern of Christianity drifting further from its roots. In today's world, there is an increasing awareness and a strong progressive tendency. While there are still traditionalists who resist any new ideas beyond what they were taught, this group may not be influential enough to sway the entire population. Among Christians, historical awareness is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. There will be a widespread desire to differentiate the doctrines added to Christianity over time from the original intentions of its founder. This process may take decades or even centuries, but it seems inevitable: there will be a significant reversal in Christian history, moving back to its original form. A movement will arise, gradually peeling away layers of doctrine, as if turning back the clock, until only the original teachings of Jesus remain, before other thinkers contributed their interpretations. When this shift occurs in the United States and Europe, influencing many to worship as if they were living in Jesus' time and following only his teachings, the institutional church will remain strong to guide this change. However, as the theological clock rewinds, the current diversity in Christianity will give way to increasing uniformity in belief and practice. Instead of differences between regions, denominations, and divisions, there will be growing similarities. Human history is full of major reversions. For instance, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, which later became a Christian institution. Our country has transitioned from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The forthcoming major reversion will unfold within Christianity, reversing history to find its origins and reducing diversity in the process. A key aspect of this transformation will be interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically, not literally. So, what has happened since Jesus' time? Looking far back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological foundation of Christianity. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion. The Jewish community was not unified, dividing into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I think The Jungle illustrates how humans are inherently greedy and self-centered, primarily concerned with improving their own lives without caring for those beneath them. The novel highlights this through various examples, most notably the factory owners and managers who focus solely on expanding their businesses. They disregard anyone or anything that might suffer due to their progress. Upton Sinclair's narrative emphasizes the environmental damage caused by these factories, describing the buildings' silhouettes and the smoke spreading far and wide. Sinclair portrays the owners as indifferent to the harm caused to people and animals by pollution and waste from the stockyards.\n\nAdditionally, the owners and managers show no concern for the workers who generate their wealth. They prioritize profit over loyalty or decency, fostering a toxic atmosphere of jealousy and hatred. Workers endure long hours and face sudden layoffs without notice or support. During the time The Jungle is set, there were few, if any, laws safeguarding workers' rights, enabling managers to exploit employees by accelerating production and maintaining poor working conditions. Though the novel doesn't state it outright, those working in Packingtown were expected to endure these harsh conditions both at work and at home. There were no organizations to assist them, and unions often exploited them further. The workers, trapped in this oppressive system, were likened to slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is considered by Edgar Allan Poe to be among his finer poems. In this work, he uses the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which scholar Mabbott connects back to Virgil. Virgil referenced an island north of Britain, thought by the Greeks to be the world's edge, using this term. Although Virgil's usage is certain, there is a more contemporary influence that merits acknowledgment. Poe was notably interested in German writers. This detail highlights Poe's familiarity with Goethe's works. In his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" Karl J. Arndt discusses the likeness between their poems, suggesting Poe was emulating Goethe.\n\nAccording to the Oxford Companion to English Literature, Goethe was a renowned author of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Within the second part of \"Faust\" is a brief poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells of a king who, after his wife's death, drinks excessively and mourns her memory. Eventually, he decides to die, bequeathing his belongings to his children, except for a goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and dies. The king's demeanor in \"The King of Thulé\" mirrors the description of the king in \"Dream-Land,\" possibly reflecting Poe's own losses and struggles with alcohol. \"Faust\" was also adapted into a romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, just before Poe used the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe mentions Thule twice in his collected works. He references \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and uses this phrase twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as complementary pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes Thule as a dark, lonely place, haunted by the memory of deceased friends, and devoid of color. These elements echo \"The King of Thulé,\" where the king mourns his wife and loses his will to rule or live. The poem's imagery suggests the speaker has entered Goethe's narrative.\n\nGoethe was a significant literary figure whom Poe would have known, if only through his admiration for Tennyson. Poe, when asked about his opinion of Tennyson, acknowledged this connection. Beyond the Tennyson link, Poe would have encountered Goethe’s work through its many reproductions post-publication.",
            "Under California law, a customer injured from slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store might be entitled to punitive damages if it can be shown that the store manager acted with malice. This could be argued if the manager was twice informed about the spill and failed to clean it for half an hour because he was having dinner. It is unlikely that a judge would quickly dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive damages. To justify such a claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant acted with willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm their actions would cause, and that the behavior was egregious. Palmer could argue that Martin should have been aware of the potential harm of not addressing the spill, especially since multiple previous incidents of slipping had occurred at D&D in the months leading up to Palmer’s accident. Despite this awareness, Martin failed to clean the spill. Although Palmer’s argument that Martin’s conduct was egregious is less compelling, it remains reasonable considering that six slip-and-fall incidents were reported in 2009, yet Martin did not take adequate measures to ensure the store’s safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin replied that he was on his dinner break and couldn’t address customer complaints at that time. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin of the spill, and he gave the same response. At 5:30 pm on that day, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped on the spill and suffered a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident, five slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for both compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and there is consideration of filing a motion for partial summary judgment against the claim for punitive damages.\n\nIn California, punitive damages can be awarded for a breach of obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud, or malice” as per Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The law defines malice as actions intended to cause harm, or if not intentional, then “despicable” actions carried out with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have deemed conduct malicious when it is done with conscious disregard for the plaintiff’s rights, where the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "She had always felt an unfulfilled longing. This yearning began when she was around 14, as she entered her teenage years, and persisted at 17. By then, she realized she sought a person rather than a thing, yet had no interest in the boys around her. Some boys showed interest in her and awkwardly tried to win her over, but none caught her attention. She often questioned this peculiar feeling, pondering what could cause such an unusual situation for a teenage girl. Years of reflection brought theories, but none substantial enough to satisfy her curiosity. Thus, she continued living, perpetually questioning her desires.\n\nA typical day at home was peaceful. Her parents were calm and kind, rarely arguing with each other or with her. The only disputes arose when their daughter asserted her independence and free spirit. Despite being the child of a serene couple, she contrasted their energy with her vibrant personality, making her well-liked.\n\nHowever, today was not a calm day. As she moved through the house seeking inspiration, she heard a brief scream from the kitchen, her mother's beautiful voice. She rushed in, panicking, and asked, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the floor, in pain, repeatedly saying \"Ow\" with short breaths. The daughter hurried to her side, trying to help. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital,\" her mother said, the words strained and hurried, revealing her agony. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up,\" she responded. Her mother gestured, and at that moment, the daughter felt grateful for the strength training she had undergone. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the backseat, and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was filled with the smell of disinfectant, sickness, and a hint of fear. However, her focus was solely on helping her mother. She quickly carried her mother inside and called for medical assistance. Several concerned faces appeared, and someone brought a rolling bed, laying her mother on it and taking her for immediate examination, leaving the daughter to wait anxiously.\n\nHer mother had fallen off a stepping stool while trying to reach a vase from the highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", correlates with a decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke-related deaths. The aMed diet is a modified version of the traditional Med diet, emphasizing a higher intake of plant-based foods, such as plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (as opposed to saturated fats), and fish, while reducing the consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown an inverse relationship between following a Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial also found the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in obese individuals. However, earlier studies did not specifically examine stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological research tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who had no history of CVD or diabetes and were part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) intended to assess nutrient intake over the past year. Over 95% of the nurses remained involved throughout the 20-year span. The FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were deemed \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions classified this way. For each FFQ, body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated, and leisure-time physical activity was assessed starting in 1986.\n\nTo minimize random variation for an individual and better reflect long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were computed (averaging scores from the previous two years). Adjustments for potential confounders, such as age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use, were made.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the association between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a reduced risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up, there were 2,391 new cases of CHD, 1,763 new cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (including fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the top quintile of aMed scores had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.71.",
            "The sign reads, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" \n\nEllen Page, known for her role in Juno, stands by herself on a street corner, holding a cardboard sign overhead with this disturbing message written in Sharpie. Burma, also referred to as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a brutal military junta that seized power in a 1962 coup. In 2007, the country witnessed its first public demonstrations in a decade, led primarily by Buddhist monks. These protests, dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution\" due to the color of the monks' robes, initially attracted broader public support. Although the government initially tolerated the monks' peaceful assemblies, the situation quickly escalated into what many viewed as a full-scale conflict between the monks and the military regime, with the military launching raids on monasteries nationwide. Foreign journalists were arrested immediately, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed on September 27th, 2007, for attending a street protest. While official reports claim 13 deaths, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army shortly before the official announcement, reported that the actual number of deaths was in the thousands.\n\nThese events are not unique. While they are recent examples of global atrocities, the suppression of dissent and the pursuit of absolute control by governments have been present throughout history. Early Roman emperors claimed divine selection for their absolute rule, while Japanese emperors were considered deities, believed to guide their people to success through innovations like Motorola phones and ritual suicide. Similarly, President George W. Bush reportedly held weekly calls with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, linked to the Republican Party.\n\nNotable historical examples include the June 4th, 1989, protests in Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students protested against government authoritarianism. The death toll estimates vary significantly, from the Chinese government's report of 200-300 deaths to the Chinese Red Cross's claim of 2,000-3,000 deaths. Another instance is the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s, where Hutu militias, with government support, systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of ethnicity. Hitler’s Third Reich, during which Jews were systematically persecuted and exterminated across several countries, stands as another extreme example.",
            "Duke Ellington's significant contribution to jazz largely stems from his long career and his exceptional skill in shaping his orchestra. While his piano presence is understated in many compositions chosen for this task, Ellington's brilliance as a composer lies in his ability to create intricate and multifaceted pieces that highlighted the unique talents of his band members. He devised a structure within which soloists could improvise freely, while also crafting carefully orchestrated segments tailored to the distinct styles of his musicians to bring out specific musical ideas. Through this, he emphasized the overall tone of the orchestra, producing cohesive and original sounds for each piece. Ellington's deep understanding of each player's sound, along with their integration into a larger ensemble, allowed him to compose some of jazz's most groundbreaking and remarkable works.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes Ellington's innovative sound, citing \"Creole Love Call\" as an early example of his use of the voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This piece demonstrates how Ellington used voice to add texture and richness, without relying on lyrics, and showcases his skill in complementing his soloists' styles, a hallmark throughout his career. The slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece features six choruses:\n\n- Chorus 1: A call and response between voice and reeds, starting smoothly and melodically, then shifting to a harsher tone.\n- Chorus 2: A muted trumpet solo elaborates on the melody, emphasizing extended blue notes.\n- Chorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, with a subtle syncopated piano backdrop.\n- Chorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response between brass and reeds.\n- Chorus 5: The climactic chorus, with reeds initiating the call and response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop-time from brass and rhythm sections.\n- Chorus 6: Returns to the structure of the first chorus, featuring a call and response between voice and reeds, with the voice using the \"growl\" technique, soloing like an instrument.\n- Tag: A brief vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add tonal color to this piece is a stylistic feature that is evident throughout his body of work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington combines his expertise in tight orchestration with his sensitivity to tone color. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing blends Miley's vocal trumpet style with Cox's instrumental-sounding voice, creating a rich and complementary sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" expands on these concepts, with Ellington effectively employing Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a key figure in Ellington's orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "What drives the specific path of evolutionary change in organisms? Are there particular limitations that steer the course of evolution? As early as 1917, D’Arcy Thompson remarked that even the simplest organic forms were challenging to express in mathematical terms—a sentiment that remains relevant today. However, the application of mathematical modeling to general aspects of mollusk shell formation, considering both their development and evolutionary history, has been explored by researchers like Raup and Stanley in 1981. Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of changes in Prunum, alongside experimental studies, can clarify the mechanisms determining the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental changes. We employed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to define quantitative parameters for modeling both theoretical and actual shell shapes. These parameters were input into the software CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We created models of hypothetical shell forms to interpret the potential limits of morphological changes in Prunum. These findings are integrated with experimental and descriptive research to enhance the understanding of large-scale evolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be conceptualized as a tube that progresses through time, rotating 360 degrees in space. These rotations of a coiled shell are known as whorls, spiraling around an imaginary central axis called the columella, which runs through the shell's center. The rate at which the whorls expand can vary, with a continuous line, the suture, marking the separation between each whorl. Typically, the largest whorl is the final one, known as the body whorl. All whorls except the last make up the spire, with the apex at the spire's tip and the base at the opposite end. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The standard orientation is the apertural view, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex pointing upward.\n\nThe following is a method for counting whorls. Begin by viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identify where the first suture starts. A line is then drawn to divide the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be considered as a sequence of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be tracked using the coordinates of each whorl’s aperture center, along with the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis path can be depicted graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical model is established, it allows for the adjustment of parameters and modification of the mollusk’s shell formation process.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have shown little change. Although the country is progressing towards achieving several Millennium Development Goals, including those related to water and sanitation, the advancements in child and maternal health fall significantly short of the targets set for 2015. The reasons for this shortfall will be explored further, suggesting the need for a stronger health system rather than solely program-focused interventions.\n\nImprovements have been made in the number of births attended by skilled health workers, with 72% now meeting this standard. However, this figure includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who may not be equipped to handle complex medical situations, leading to a high rate of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. Thus, while progress in this area appears positive, it is somewhat deceptive, indicating much more work remains. Additionally, there has been a reduction in the proportion of children under five with diarrhea receiving professional medical treatment. Incomplete data on postnatal care highlights another area of concern, as rates remain low nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates are lower than expected, at about 4%. This statistic reveals another troubling issue; while urban areas have a c-section rate of 7%, rural areas have only 2%, highlighting a disparity in healthcare access across the country. Access to healthcare is concentrated in urban zones, and vertical equity is also a challenge. A 27% difference in service use exists between the poorest and wealthiest groups, indicating that the poor face greater challenges accessing healthcare, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn considering future steps to improve neonatal and maternal health indicators, the fundamental question is how best to address the service gaps. Should Indonesia focus on specific programs or enhance the overall health system, without prioritizing pre- and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children? Programmatic approaches are appealing because they offer specific, manageable goals and often deliver quicker outcomes. However, there are notable drawbacks. A significant issue is that focusing resources on one area can divert funding from others, drawing human resources to areas with more funding, as seen with international HIV/AIDS funding impacting the family planning sector. Additionally, having multiple parallel programs for the same area can lead to service duplication and lack of coordination, increasing paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "Over the past century, the categorization of Popular Music has expanded so extensively that it's challenging to enumerate all the genres definitively. Adding to the complexity, nearly every genre—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—has given rise to numerous sub-genres and even further subdivisions. Among these, the Heavy Metal rock sub-genre has arguably emerged as one of the most varied and expressive in popular music over the last 40 years. Its expressiveness is due to its wide emotional range, often skewing toward darker themes. Its diversity stems from the genre's inherent flexibility, recognized early on, which allowed people to create their own sub-genres, followed by further subdivisions, a trend that continues today.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal scene has evolved to encompass so many niche groups that defining heavy metal precisely is challenging. While it now incorporates many elements from other genres, like all music, it originated from a specific point. To truly understand the metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp what the metal movement represents and why it's considered a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nIn many respects, metal is a movement characterized by darkness. It can be described as \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more aggression, more drama. It involves less primitiveness and more technical skill, with band members demonstrating considerable proficiency with their instruments. Metal is also, unsurprisingly, a movement deeply influenced by drug use. The psychedelic drug surge in the mid-70s prompted people to create wild, otherworldly records, using drugs as a catalyst for their creativity. Metal contains many dark, intense qualities, which was quite novel for the music scene, as much of popular music lacked such dark emotional depth. Additionally, later metal generations drew inspiration from the dark, intense qualities prevalent during the Romantic Era. Lyrics like those from \"Helter Skelter\" illustrate the darkness essential to the movement:\n\nThese lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" reveal the darker aspect of the Beatles, reflecting the highs and lows often associated with drug influence. This song is considered by some to be among the earliest Heavy Metal songs. It was crafted as a response to a Rolling Stones track, which also leaned towards a heavier, darker tone. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate that they could match the Stones' heaviness, leading them to include this song on The White Album.",
            "Several decades before the Surrealist artists began creating their dreamlike artworks, Henri Rousseau was meticulously crafting his personal dreams, both in a literal and figurative sense. \"The Dream,\" a painting completed in 1910 by the renowned Post-Impressionist artist, not only depicts a woman amazed by the wonders of a dreamland but also embodies Rousseau's own aspirations and ambitions as a painter. From the start of his artistic journey, he longed for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, facing a challenging internal struggle to achieve this dream. \"The Dream\" is the piece that most accurately mirrors Rousseau's enduring internal conflict: whether to conform to or imitate specific art styles to gain acceptance in the critical art world he cherished or to maintain his creative independence and uniqueness, forging his own path.\n\nTo fully understand \"The Dream\" from this viewpoint, one must first have some knowledge of Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France, Henri Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed middle-class prosperity (Shattuck 47). He had no formal art education during his upbringing; instead, he worked for the French municipal toll service, known as a gabelou, until the age of forty, though he mistakenly earned the nickname douanier, or customs inspector (Shattuck 46). After the death of his first wife, Clémence, and the loss of eight infant children, Rousseau was left with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and deep sorrow (Shattuck 49). Seeking solace in a new life, he turned to painting for comfort and a fresh start. Unlike his contemporaries who often romanticized the peasant in their works, Rousseau was essentially a folk artist, embodying the hopes and dreams of the average person from his social class.\n\nRousseau's obsession with gaining acceptance in the art world is somewhat understandable when considered in context: as mentioned, he was not formally trained in painting and began his career much later in life, competing with many talented and more renowned modern artists. Despite years of work, Rousseau only began to receive the recognition he sought around the same time that Matisse was establishing his reputation. In \"Modern French Painters,\" author Jan Gordon notes that while Rousseau and Matisse were technically competitors, they differed not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations for painting: \"Matisse was a painter who feared producing clichéd works, whereas Rousseau aimed to create art so conventional that it would earn him entry into the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "Numerous great thinkers have suggested that there is a deep link between ethics and aesthetics, and between truth and beauty. I believe there is a fundamental reason for this. John Keats expresses this idea in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" when he writes, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our knowledge comes from education or experience, but as Keats implies, we seem to understand ethics and aesthetics without formal teaching. Both fields aim to describe rather than prescribe. Our exploration of morality and beauty largely involves explaining why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than providing rules for creating good art or moral behavior. Critiques of art or morals can never fully capture what makes something good or beautiful. For instance, discussions about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa often focus on aspects like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't fully explain why it is considered good art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often say, \"There's just something about it,\" before giving a more detailed explanation. I believe that both art and morals cannot be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor notes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe the features of a literary work, there remains something transcendent. I think ethics shares this quality. Wittgenstein says, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that this \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, is the most powerful attribute of art and morality, and that the transcendental nature of both provides a link between them. I believe that morality and art are closely connected because we experience them most profoundly at a noumenal level, a Kantian term meaning they affect us in a way that can be felt but not fully explained. This connection is even stronger in the art of literature. As McKean states, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. Moral standards may not apply to other arts, like music, but they are as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Modern Germany is recognized as a formidable and unified nation, characterized by a diverse culture stretching from the shadows of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This cultural richness is evident from Cologne on the Rhine, through the heart of Germany, to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. With such a distinct culture, it is understandable that contemporary Germany has roots in various tribes and sources.\n\nGermania is the ancestral homeland of the Germans, and the origin of its name is a topic of debate among scholars and historians. Tacitus suggested that the name derived from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were referred to as Germans before crossing the Rhine to fight the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first mentioned the term \"Germanus\" in his account of the Gallic Wars, where he described his conquests over the Gauls and battles with Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine with dubious intentions. He adopted this term from the Gauls themselves to differentiate between the conquered Gauls and the unconquered tribes. Although the precise origin remains uncertain, some speculate it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish tongue. In the opening chapter of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar wrote: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others suggest the name might have originated from the spear used in warfare, called a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or possibly from the Old Irish word garim, meaning \"to shout,\" implying the Germans were loud or boisterous. (Names of Germany)\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work “De Origine et situ Germanorum,” documented the origins of the Germans, noting that he viewed them as indigenous, unmixed with other races through migration or interaction. He argued that in earlier times, migrations occurred by sea rather than land, leading him to question why anyone would leave Asia or Africa for Germany, with its harsh climate and severe demeanor, unless it was their homeland. (Tacitus, 98)\n\nWhy would anyone leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, at least not yet. They would launch expeditions into Germania for goods and occasionally conduct land campaigns, but they predominantly returned to their vast empire. As Germanic tribes emerged in the mid-first century, they lived along the Roman Empire's borders, trading resources and serving in the Roman army ranks. (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "The play Twelfth Night suggests that while disguises can effectively enable prolonged deception, ultimately, one must abandon these false identities or risk losing their true self. A significant challenge in ending such deceit is the potential for alienation. Thus, a person must choose between preserving their own identity or maintaining relationships with others. Some individuals may react indifferently to being deceived, but others may be deeply offended by the masquerade.\n\nThe theme of deception through gender role reversal is particularly complex, raising questions about why someone might feel compelled to adopt a disguise of the opposite gender. In Viola’s situation, her disguise serves as a means of protection: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Upon arriving in a foreign land, Viola disguises herself as a man to safeguard herself from potential threats. While her plan is successful, it also isolates her from the women around her, severing an important support network. Compounding the issue, her male disguise is so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, Viola grapples with unspoken romantic tensions with Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo a modern audience, Twelfth Night might be viewed as showing how deception can reveal hidden emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain parts of the play suggest that these characters might have latent desires that are brought to the surface by Viola/Cesario’s presence. For example, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because she believes Cesario is a man, or does she secretly have feelings for women? It seems unlikely, as Shakespeare’s Olivia appears to mock people of his era who judge others based solely on appearance. This is demonstrated by how easily Olivia shifts her affections from Cesario to Sebastian and starts to see Cesario/Viola as a sibling rather than a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German colonial rule is often criticized for its harshness, particularly regarding the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa. Nonetheless, it is overly simplistic to characterize an entire colonial empire with such a broad brush. The German colonial empire featured a variety of policies and governing styles that differed across its geographic expanse. Similarly, the approach to education varied throughout the colonies. When the British took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a significant number of educated and literate Africans. German educational initiatives in Kamerun and other colonies also received commendation from contemporary writers. The situation in South West Africa (now Namibia) was markedly different. Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and was actively involved in educating the natives, education in South West Africa was largely left to missionary societies with minimal government backing. However, the government did allocate considerable resources to the education of Europeans in the colony, setting up state schools and providing more substantial support and regulation for missionary schools. These educational strategies left a lasting impact on South West Africa, persisting even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies had significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to the distinct experience of South West Africa. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors and focus on new research concerning the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is a substantial body of literature focused specifically on education within the German colonial empire. Most of these works are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The primary goal of these early writings was to describe the educational systems in these colonies. Later English-language publications broadened the discussion through comparative studies of educational practices across different German colonies and more in-depth analyses of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant variations in the educational systems across different colonies. One of the most notable works that explicitly addresses the subject of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of these two colonies and explores the factors that explain the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa accounts for many of the distinctive characteristics of the colony’s educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial holdings, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, although much of it consisted of arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans resided in South West Africa, whereas the next largest settler population was in East Africa, with only 5,336 Europeans.",
            "The United States and Mexico serve as an example of two countries that were once embroiled in a long-lasting rivalry spanning 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, gaining Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Numerous other conflicts occurred between the two nations, eventually subsiding just before World War I. The rivalry was fueled by clashes over key issues such as religion, culture, tradition, and significant material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis situation is similar to many other countries with enduring rivalries with neighboring nations. Countries sharing a border often have conflicting interests that lead to rivalries. The United States and Mexico exemplify such enduring border rivalries. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, both countries are geographically close to the United States and have been its rivals, whereas other Latin American nations have generally maintained good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences were a significant source of tension between the two countries, a problem that has historically affected many nations. Sally Frahm (2001) observes that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). Similar to the ideological and interest-based Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, the U.S.-Mexico tensions were rooted in religious preferences rather than political structures. This mistrust stemmed from the historical distrust between the English and Spanish, which both countries inherited from their colonial rulers, hindering the development of positive foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during this 57-year period of rivalry. Most of these disputes revolved around territorial issues, particularly border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier challenges. Raids by bandits and outlaws on American border towns persisted until both nations asserted military force along their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). Schmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry began to diminish as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and eventually ended as American priorities shifted \"from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p. 110) in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I unexpectedly became disabled due to an illness I had never heard of before. At that time, I was working as a nurse, a career I chose because it offered the stability and security I lacked during my childhood. The advice I frequently heard growing up was, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" Although my true aspiration was to be a scientist or journalist, or perhaps both, I opted for nursing.\n\nHowever, at 46, I found myself single, without savings, and unable to work. Even now, after 15 years on Social Security Disability, I have nothing to my name. I manage to get by, but each day is a battle affecting my sense of safety, security, and self-worth. While nothing in my life is predictable anymore, I do know one thing: I couldn't have survived these years without the support of my family and a few close friends. In times of true crisis, no matter how strong you think you are, you don't feel strong at all.\n\nMy point is that life will always have emergencies, both big and small, and no matter how well-prepared you are, some challenges are too significant to handle alone. I agree that in the U.S., we should stop relying solely on big government, which is deteriorating. Instead, I would prefer Americans to learn to trust and support one another, rather than each person retreating to build their own fallout shelters.\n\nConservatives in the U.S. often speak of \"rugged individualism\" as the foundation of our country, but in reality, what sustained our ancestors during tough times was compassion, mutual respect, and resource-sharing. The pioneers who traveled in wagon trains across the Rockies didn't reach the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in case of a biological attack. I have several flashlights, a variety of batteries, plenty of candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have land and resources for a small farm and the ability to preserve your own food, do it. It's a smart idea, as is having a wood stove, provided you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while doing all this, take the time to get to know your neighbors.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince destined to be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he gave up worldly possessions, achieved enlightenment, and his teachings eventually led to the creation of Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being its most traditional branch. Buddhism is approximately 2,500 years old, and it has evolved since the time of Buddha, evident in practices like the annual water-cutting ceremony in Theravada Buddhist Sri Lanka. This event, involving both monks and laypeople, holds religious significance, even though Buddha never mentioned such celebrations. Variations span from minor traditions to the fundamental beliefs of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both monastic and lay, has had to adapt its doctrines over time due to both internal and external influences, some of which were supportive and others adversarial.\n\nSeveral key terms are frequently used in this discussion. Internal forces originate from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic involvement, while external forces arise from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces aim to harm the Buddhist community, stemming from negative views of Buddhism, whereas benign forces neither intend to harm nor help Buddhism, although they may inadvertently do so. These terms recur throughout the discourse.\n\nTo begin, one must understand the fundamentals of the religion—the central doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka or three baskets of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka includes all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains Buddhism's metaphysical aspects. These metaphysical ideas include Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—life’s inherent suffering, and Anicca—the impermanence of all things. Understanding these concepts is essential to ending Sansara, the ongoing cycle of death and rebirth. With the cessation of Sansara comes the end of lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, upon reaching enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka establishes life rules: for laypeople, the five precepts are refraining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and consuming intoxicants. Monks have additional disciplinary rules. The core doctrinal concept in Buddhism is the four noble truths: first, Dukkha, the truth that life involves suffering; second, the truth that attachment causes suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new.

Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture plays a crucial role in negotiations. It can be as much about what it is not as what it is and what it represents. Culture is neither uniform nor a singular entity. Generalizations such as \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While it’s useful to understand cultural generalizations, negotiators benefit more from grasping the significance of culture on the issue at hand and how cultural attitudes might influence discussions. When encountering a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that relates to their own culture, naturally leading to comparisons.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset may involve studying its history or recognizing its biases. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, one should accept it and work within its parameters, particularly in negotiations, especially if one is negotiating from a weaker position. Similarly, when a negotiator is in unfamiliar territory, respecting traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and progress the negotiation.\n\nIt is essential to recognize that culture doesn't solely exist on a national or international level. Companies within a nation often develop their own corporate cultures. For example, a corporate culture might prioritize long office hours or a more flexible schedule. Corporate culture can be observed in employee dress codes, communication styles (direct versus indirect communication, delegation of responsibilities), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, while others limit it to \"company-approved\" charities or fundraisers. Variations in American corporate culture from company to company (and even within different regions, urban versus suburban environments) highlight the diversity of thought within a societal culture. Certain cultures may seem less stratified than American culture and appear more uniform to outsiders, but this similarity invites deeper exploration.\n\nUnderstanding values is even more important, as they explain the reasons behind a culture. If saving face or maintaining communal harmony is valued, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superior to succeed in negotiations. Similarly, a negotiator from a culture that values hard bargaining won't necessarily rush to settle. Considering these generalities is crucial before negotiating. However, learning about one's opponent on a personal level enhances the effectiveness of negotiations.",
            "The phrase \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God,’\" first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and serves as the starting point for St. Anselm's argument about God's existence. This perspective is also shared by Thomas Aquinas, another author under discussion. Since both argue in favor of the same idea, and our task is to evaluate which argument is stronger, we must assume, for simplicity, that both are correct in their belief in the existence of the God depicted in the Bible. Considering a different type of deity would not allow for a fair comparison of their arguments, as both authors essentially defend a specific concept of God. With that in mind, I propose that while each presents valid points, neither offers a comprehensive foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo support this assertion, we will first look at St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm's passage suggests a path to understanding through faith, by introspection to find evidence of God. He argues that since God exists within our comprehension, we cannot truly imagine His nonexistence. Although his terminology can be lengthy and somewhat unclear, the main idea is that the proof of God resides in one's own mind. St. Anselm implies that we do not need to look beyond ourselves to discover the truth about God; His existence is evident by examining what we inherently know to be true within our minds. External evidence is presumably unnecessary. This acceptance of something without irrefutable empirical evidence is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nThis concept contrasts with that of St. Thomas Aquinas, who argues that God's existence can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, without relying on faith. This approach could be advantageous for evangelism, a key aspect of Christianity, as it would allow for the conversion of new believers based solely on logic, without requiring acceptance of unprovable claims. St. Thomas presents five logical arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each, he essentially shows that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for His existence. Just as you can deduce the characteristics and existence of a missing puzzle piece without seeing it, logic dictates that God's existence can be inferred.",
            "Various authors employ diverse methods to evoke specific emotions or attitudes in their readers regarding significant topics, and some techniques prove more effective than others. In his novel, The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald employs several such methods. Occasionally, he combines an adjective and a noun in unusual pairings to create a particular atmosphere surrounding a subject. At other times, he assigns symbolic meaning to an object and uses it for the same purpose. Fitzgerald extensively uses this technique with colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, he imbues colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, with specific meanings, which he later uses to evoke certain feelings associated with important elements.\n\nFitzgerald associates white/gray with uniformity, where white suggests a more refined and upper-class quality, while gray conveys an older and faded aspect. He establishes these meanings early in the novel through frequent references. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are consistently described as being \"in white\" (8)—indeed, almost everyone is depicted in white: Nick attends Gatsby's party in \"white flannels\" (41), Tom wears a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only exception is when Nick observes Gatsby's party, where \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further defines these colors by associating them with mundane or insignificant subjects: as Nick heads to work, he travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the guest list at Gatsby's parties becomes \"gray names\" (61) on Nick’s timetable, and Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—indicating uniformity (28). He also uses white or gray to describe ordinary people or locations: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" at the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established the significance of white/gray, he employs them to indicate unimportance or uniformity in certain subjects. This use of color symbolism begins with Daisy. After a period without notable mentions of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" prompting readers to perceive her as less of an individual character and more as a uniform object, something Gatsby desires (74). Fitzgerald continues to use this color symbolism around Daisy to reinforce the notion of her as a uniform addition, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18), and once again, she is in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County boasts a highly productive agricultural sector due to its mild and sunny climate. The region typically grows crops such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, and tree fruits like peaches and lemons, along with berries, honey, and peppers. There is a strong demand for organic community-supported agriculture in the San Diego area, with many organizations having long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Numerous organic farms offer guided tours of their farming practices and provide opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other leisure activities. This type of operation enables landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitats, allowing for recreational use and creating opportunities for farm tours and educational programs. \n\nOrganic farming presents a lucrative niche market and often leads to increased biodiversity in plants and wildlife, as it avoids using chemicals in the soil and water. However, it can be more costly than conventional farming due to the need for more labor and management to control pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals. Organic farms tend to experience higher losses and lack the economies of scale of larger operations. Practices beneficial to wildlife, though not exclusively tied to organic farming, may also involve higher labor costs, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, removing invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create specific conditions like edge habitats or open ground patches. Therefore, the landowner in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land chosen for this scenario is a 160-acre parcel near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It includes chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This area is part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion under the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan, currently under review, considers over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, while others like burrowing owls are declining and may soon be listed.\n\nHistorically, this area was inhabited by Native Americans for countless generations and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The land was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing or wood production over the decades. To explore realistic options for a small farmer to reduce costs and maintain wildlife-friendly practices, I selected a property from a real estate website and researched available government programs. As an example of what farming this land might entail, I identified an organic farm in the same area.",
            "The connection between brothers is a powerful and unyielding bond, filled with a myriad of emotions such as love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers possess a deep understanding of each other, unmatched by any other relationship, and see themselves reflected in one another. It is in moments of crisis that the true essence of this bond is revealed, whether for better or worse. The clarity of these emotions comes at a significant cost, and part of comprehending them involves facing the consequences they bring. When a brother gazes into another's eyes and sees his own likeness, he perceives himself not as others do, but as he truly is. The essence of their character is found in their actions and the repercussions of those actions. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme and the turbulent emotions it entails. Against a richly described backdrop, these boys embark on a hopeless journey. The climactic scene sees deep disappointment collide with fierce pride, resulting in only one brother surviving. The theme is conveyed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator’s perspective, which communicates the complex emotions the protagonist experiences and his perception of the world, both of which strongly influence his actions. The protagonist’s behavior is driven by one central emotion: pride. From his first outings with his younger brother, Doodle, to their final, tragic adventure, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He desired a brother to whom he could impart all his worldly skills, like \"...holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He longed for a companion to race to Horsehead Landing and to accompany him atop the great pine behind the barn. However, Doodle's condition made these dreams impossible. Born with a frail heart, Doodle's survival was uncertain, and engaging in strenuous physical activity was nearly out of the question. This was a heavy blow to the young protagonist, whose head was filled with grand fantasies, only to see them shattered in an instant. In fact, he even admits to feeling anger towards the child, recalling thoughts of suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would contemplate such an act? Yet, his heart softens when the child smiles at him, a simple gesture that filled him with hope. This suggests that his intent was not strong, as deep down, he had an innate love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex and imaginative system for processing information. As technology evolved from basic to advanced, the metaphors used to describe the brain also changed. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, followed by a book, and most recently, a computer. When studying the brain, it is important to remember that these metaphors have limitations and can lead to incorrect assumptions.  \nInformation processing begins with input from sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light photons into electrochemical signals. The brain’s algorithms repeatedly transform this sensory information through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles basic details such as color, orientation, and object borders—where color changes sharply in a small area—to determine that a box is being seen. Top-down processing leverages decisions made during bottom-up processing to expedite recognizing the box. In this scenario, top-down processing might help identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped void in the white background.  \nAfter a certain level of processing, an attention filter determines the significance of the signal and which cognitive processes should access it. For example, though your brain processes each blade of grass when you glance at your shoes, a functioning attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. Conversely, you might notice your name even amid a noisy environment. There are several stages of processing, and attention continuously influences the results.  \nFor the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, with specific encoding methods for each type of sensory input. For example, verbal input can be encoded based on its structure—what the printed word looks like, phonemically—what the word sounds like, or semantically—what the word means. Once stored, information must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which retains information for about 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal cycling through a specific series of neurons for a short duration. Information in long-term memory is believed to be preserved in the structure of certain protein types.  \nThere are various models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, some derived from how humans recall memories, others from computer science, and still others from neurophysiology. The semantic network model suggests that concepts are represented by nodes, which are interconnected based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which could be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a severe financial crisis. Unemployment surged, the housing market collapsed, and numerous significant American corporations were devastated. This recession continues today, prompting us to ask: what caused this crisis, and how can it be prevented? Essentially, the crisis was the result of self-serving and shortsighted political decisions that compelled banks and companies to issue sub-prime loans within a fragile financial framework. At the same time, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and bundle these mortgages into complex financial instruments like CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves and passed the turmoil onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold, impacting the wider economy.\n\nThe crisis's origins trace back to 1999 during Clinton's presidency, as he sought re-election by boosting his popularity. To achieve this, the Clinton administration eased lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999 that \"Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes accurately predicted the potential fallout: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As highlighted earlier, and as Holmes anticipated, reckless lending would inevitably lead to economic collapse.\n\nVarious factors contributed to the economic downturn, one being the novel and intricate mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were heavily utilized in the years preceding the crisis, further entangling more economic sectors with the housing market. This led U.S. households and financial markets to overextend themselves in the housing sector, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nUltimately, the housing bubble burst, and financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities suffered. In 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts, accounting for about 30% of the nation’s GDP. As a result, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at low prices, Lehman Brothers was disbanded, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to convert into commercial banks under strict regulation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That point in your narrative where you spread your writerly wings and soar, mesmerizing everyone with your captivating, even enchanting, prose. Or it's the moment when your readers doze off or hit the \"Back\" button, cursing your name. Dr. Merlin is known to yell at her screen when she encounters an overload of information, and not in a pleasant way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy gentle readers are familiar with the fundamental writing advice, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself in extensive sections of text where nothing, or too much, occurs. Exposition is the mischievous imp whispering to you to dispense with the history to reach the exciting parts (not to be mistaken for the imp on the other shoulder urging the author to divulge every detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition involves informing the audience of what happened, usually in straightforward prose. In film, exposition occurs when one character relays a deluge of information to another, much like in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author conveying the details.\n\nAn example might help. While reading a story, you learn that the heroine met her beloved at a particular place and time, they wed in grand fashion, and her husband was murdered before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to span two pages with each having only two lines of dialogue. You'd anticipate the author spending time on the husband's character, illustrating through his words and actions how deeply he loves his wife. Similarly, you would expect the heroine to demonstrate, through various means, how much his presence transformed and enriched her life (especially if the story later explicitly states this). Properly introducing the husband's character would enable you to become emotionally invested in his fate, providing insight into the heroine's character: what drew her to him, the depth of their bond, clues about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as seen through his eyes, and so on. You would grieve his death alongside her, thereby deepening your connection to the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you'd expect substance on the bare storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your responsibility to add that substance. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, continues*) There's often a temptation to gloss over certain details. Maybe you're introducing a new character and you know he was in the Air Force, he's the night manager of a gas station now, he's been married twice, has no kids, enjoys fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was a live broadcast from NBC 4 on the morning of August 13, 2011. The main story covered a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. They didn't mention her name but showed his mugshot, describing him as looking quite menacing. The report was brief, lasting about two minutes, as the story was still developing. The only details provided were that he had stabbed her several times and had been arrested. I felt the coverage was appropriately timed.\n\nThe second story involved an early morning shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area, leaving him critically injured with no arrests or suspects identified at that time. The SWAT Team was investigating. This story also seemed short, possibly because it involved a black man or was set in a predominantly black neighborhood. I've noticed for years that crimes involving minority victims often receive less attention. If the victim is a white child or adult, the media tends to give it much more coverage.\n\nThe next report was about a gunshot hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. They shared details about where they believed the incident occurred and determined it was hit by a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nAnother story was about predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to stay in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. This segment was brief, likely meant as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nThey also reported on a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie, approximately six feet tall and weighing around 150 pounds. I felt they spent an unusual amount of time focusing on his race and skin color.\n\nAnother story covered Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin found guilty of conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, they mentioned his sentence as \"300 months\" instead of 25 years, which seemed to emphasize the severity. They also noted he was Hispanic, though it didn't seem relevant to the case.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of security intended to follow an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund, but it offers more flexibility and can be traded like a stock on an exchange. An ETF provides the diversification benefits of an index fund along with the advantages of owning individual stocks, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as little as one share per transaction. Despite these appealing features, ETFs have significantly lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund. However, there are some drawbacks, such as the necessity to pay a commission for any ETF trade, akin to a stock order. Another advantage of ETFs is the vast array of funds available. While these benefits are clearly outlined, a prudent financial investor should assess whether the stated benefits, such as diversification, truly exist and to what degree. For this purpose, we will analyze the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to see if the advantages of owning a single ETF are comparable to those of holding a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, and whether there are better configurations of the same stocks that could offer a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo assess the ETF, it would be cumbersome to include every holding, so we have opted to consider only the top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF. Listed below are the top 10 holdings and their percentage of total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF overall, we can use the current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate each stock's contribution to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio consisted solely of these 10 stocks in the proportions set by the ETF's holdings. The calculations of Beta and return are shown in the chart below.\n\nThe chart indicates that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than that of the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. It also shows that the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole. Based on the results so far, it appears that a portfolio composed of just the top 10 holdings could yield a higher return with a lower beta. Nevertheless, there is a chance that the means of these two portfolios might not be statistically different.\n\nTo evaluate whether these portfolios differ statistically, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is calculated and normalized to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, the third month of the project saw a sharp decline in commuter log submissions, which was somewhat discouraging, and the reasons for this are not entirely clear. The arrival of winter on a New England campus likely led to fewer people commuting by bike or on foot, possibly explaining part of the downturn. December is also the end of the fall semester, a time when everyone is busy with completing assignments, grading, and other tasks, so keeping up with the commuter log might not have been a priority. Additionally, December ushers in the bustling holiday season and a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many do not need to be on campus. Classes resume in late January for the spring semester, which could also explain the low log numbers for that month. However, this doesn't clarify the low submissions in February. It might be that such projects initially generate enthusiasm that naturally wanes over time. To counteract this, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a focused campaign that did boost log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the key challenges we faced was maintaining project momentum amid a natural decline in engagement and the specific disruptions caused by holidays and semester breaks in higher education.\n\nAnother challenge of this project, or any alternative commuting initiative, is that people cherish the freedom, independence, and flexibility associated with driving their own cars, which is deeply ingrained in our culture. Therefore, offering incentives to encourage alternative commuting is crucial. We distributed numerous prizes like gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, a local bookstore, and some larger national chains. It would have been interesting to see how offering even larger prizes might have influenced participation—such as awarding a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car, which might have helped address the engagement drop. The nature of the prizes remained consistent throughout the project. However, if the value of the prizes had increased over time, it might have made a difference. The gift cards were quite effective at the beginning, but announcing in December that we were adding a couple of bicycles, and in January a hybrid or electric car, could potentially have increased participation and engagement rather than seeing a decline.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all fifteen trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films typically utilize creative editing techniques to create illusions. My analysis focused on describing the artistic elements of most trick films and identifying unique evolutionary features in some of the later ones. Generally, trick films from the turn of the century are confined to a set, framed within a frontal proscenium, with no camera movement, using long and medium shots, and following a strict one shot per film approach. However, some films from the early 1900s deviate from these norms by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne common feature of these trick films is their filming within an interior set framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, not moving to follow characters or objects. This style was prevalent in early films, drawing inspiration from theater and, specifically for trick films, from vaudeville and magic shows. A drawback of using a stage setup is that characters in trick films typically only move laterally, without approaching or retreating from the camera. For instance, in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), actors enter from the right and move horizontally. Even as they exit the frame, the camera remains static.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition also results in predominantly long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-ups are absent in Edison’s trick films, reflecting the theater and vaudeville tradition where audiences saw the complete performance within the stage's borders. In early films, actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, eliminating the need for close-ups.\n\nMost early trick films adhere to a pattern where one conceptual shot equals a film. This restricts their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used, and limits their dramatic or narrative potential. They mainly focus on brief, vaudeville-style tricks like magic and disappearing acts with minimal story. However, in a trick film, what appears as one conceptual shot to the viewer might involve multiple physical shots combined to create illusions of appearance or disappearance. For example, in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), careful observation reveals the transition point to the physical shot featuring Mary's severed \"head,\" even though the film appears as a single conceptual shot to the audience.",
            "Ian Watt refers to the classic \"Gothic Novel\" as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" in his work, The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic style has been both criticized and celebrated, accused of lacking depth, yet praised for its 'terrible sublime' quality, as noted by Burke. Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the first \"Gothic Novel,\" merged elements of both \"ancient and modern\" romances to craft the early Gothic genre, introducing a novel literary expression. Walpole combined \"old\" theatrical techniques with 'new' naturalistic elements found in 'modern' novels to present what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre incorporates many aspects reminiscent of medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and customs. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, \"gothic\" described various peoples, styles, and eras, often seen as outdated or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The blend of theatrical \"Gothic\" elements with the novel's new format, which offers a more intimate view of characters' psychology, has allowed Gothic literature to endure over time, simultaneously appearing obsolete and fresh to readers far removed from its original context.\n\nA key gothic theme in Gothic novels is Chivalry. The medieval concept of chivalry, which involved training a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry holds particular significance for Gothic authors because it symbolizes the classic knight—brave, honorable, competent—and the perceived absence of these ideals in society, as observed by writers like Walpole. By employing chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, foreshadowing the Gothic's evolution into Romanticism and serving as an attempt to better the present. When Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto, he was amidst political turmoil and concerned about the future. Immersed in politics and possibly facing unjust accusations, he may have believed, even if subconsciously, that the perceived morality and inherent \"goodness\" of people from the gothic era were missing in contemporary society. This notion is evident in several characters, including Frederic. Before meeting Frederic, the reader learns that he possesses many chivalric qualities; he is depicted as a prince who has endured suffering, been profoundly affected by tragedy, and is presumed to have been killed by infidels. The portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, naturally, exaggerated, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the series of processes involved in moving goods from a customer's order through the stages of raw material acquisition, supply, production, and distribution until they reach the customer. The concept of supply chain management was introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver. He explained the comprehensive process of planning, executing, and controlling supply chain activities to meet customer needs efficiently and promptly. The supply chain consists of six fundamental components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nProduction is the initial phase of the supply chain process and serves as the foundation for the entire operation. This stage involves determining when, why, where, and how products will be manufactured. Managers must understand customer preferences, which can be gauged by analyzing market trends. The market offers insights into customer demands, enabling managers to decide what products to produce and in what quantities. Once these decisions are made, managers then determine the best location and facility for production, considering volume and quality requirements while ensuring customer satisfaction. After selecting the production site, managers focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Effective planning is crucial, as overlooking details can lead to significant time and financial losses. For instance, my experience working at Walmart and Target highlighted the importance of having structured processes, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments, which helps streamline operations and set clear expectations.\n\nThe second crucial component in supply chain management is supply. Supply involves making strategic decisions that define a facility's core capabilities and determine the growth of outsourcing partnerships. A company might have various production divisions for a single product, each with unique equipment, personnel, and expertise. Managers must choose the most suitable division for each stage of the production process. Sometimes, outsourcing to other companies is considered to enhance efficiency. The primary motivation for outsourcing is to achieve velocity, which is the ability to deliver quality and flexibility while minimizing or maintaining low costs.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous detail and focus on the aristocracy of the era. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, while considered Victorian, deviate from this norm. These novels incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, which are not typical of the time, to enhance their characters by offering deeper insights into their motivations and emotions.\n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels often utilize mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike experiences, although the content and purpose differ in each case. In Oliver Twist, such strange occurrences often reveal insights into Oliver’s inner struggles, his suffering, and his understanding of the reality around him. When the incident of Oliver being shot is revisited in chapter 28, he relives it vividly, almost like a dream, while he seeks assistance. This passage highlights the lack of control Oliver had over the events, as well as the severity of his health condition, reflected in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing his senses so much that he is unaware of the “unseen hand” that carries him away; he relives his despair, detached from the initial shock of pain, as it has become constant and associated with fear rather than surprise. Oliver’s overwhelming experience raises the question of whose will led to his misfortune, as it certainly wasn’t his own. This incident reinforces the idea that Oliver has little control over anything, unable to even attempt to influence the outcome of events, even when his life is at stake. This selection suggests a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if old Fagin has begun to break him, compelling him to accept his despair and affecting his ability to respond. Otherwise, it is implied that Oliver would have made some effort to save himself.\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.",
            "A few years back, I worked in an after-school program where I tutored elementary students. I tried to assist them with any subject they found difficult, although my expertise was in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to help a young boy named Adrian, who was in either third or fourth grade and was struggling with reading. I noticed something unusual; while he could pronounce some letters perfectly, others were a complete mystery to him. It was quite odd. Adrian, who was of Latino heritage, spoke flawless English, which puzzled me. We continued to face challenges until I met his mother. I was watching over a few students who stayed behind while the rest of the group went on a field trip when she arrived. Adrian's mother spoke only Spanish, not a word of English. Despite my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate. It suddenly became clear to me: Adrian could read well but didn't know the English alphabet very thoroughly. I'm not sure if this realization helped him significantly, but I hope he's doing better now. \n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issue in schools, particularly in California. It also illustrates that the problem isn't always apparent. Even a child who speaks perfect English can find reading it a formidable challenge. We can all agree that this issue exists, but what can be done? In Adrian's case, the answer was relatively straightforward: tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children who barely speak English, the solution is more complicated. There's no single answer. The key is in combining various approaches like the dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes. \n\nThe dual language system is an excellent concept, not just for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Research shows that children in bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Some fear that it's a waste of resources and won't benefit most students, but that's not true. If we made such programs the norm rather than the exception, all children would gain from them. How should we implement this? Should we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that would be impractical. However, there's no reason we can't have special aides or tutors who are bilingual.",
            "From a young age, many of us are taught that there exists something larger and more incomprehensible than ourselves. Some attend Sunday school to learn about it, others go to Temple, or seek answers within themselves. Many accept the religious beliefs passed down by their parents, while some reject these beliefs, insisting that nothing exists beyond their personal, self-centered world. We might adopt one belief system only to later replace it with another. Regardless of the path we take, we strive to define ourselves through our individual views on spirituality, searching for guidance to lead us from darkness to light.\n\n\"My favorite bird is a cardinal,\" my father replied when I asked him. We were sitting on our front porch, listening to the rain drumming on the tin roof, sharing a cigarette. The gutters poured water, drowning the plants lining the porch. He gazed into the rain, his look a mix of searching and reminiscing. Over the past months, he had lost weight, and his clothes hung loosely on him. His hair had thinned too, more than I remembered. He kept looking at the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt isolated, scared, unable to express how much I would miss him, as speaking about it would make it all too real. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer to his, and joined him in watching the rain fall in the June twilight.\n\nMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation did not alleviate his suffering but extended his life a few months beyond the doctors' expectations; I couldn't understand the value in prolonging his suffering. What kind of God would allow this, I wondered. Alone at night, I didn't pray; I felt that if God existed, he had long since stopped listening to me.\n\nI didn't want to witness his transition from this life to the next, so I didn't. I couldn't bear to watch the life that brought me into the world as it ended. I wanted to remember my father for how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew him better than anyone else, and I was certain he wouldn't want his only child to witness his death. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an enthusiastic early supporter of Republicanism. Despite being mainly an agriculturist, his profession and brief political career made him known for his commitment and vocal stance on personal freedom and governance. His belief in an agrarian system shaped nearly all his views on government. He sought to uphold and promote what he saw as the most noble profession, influencing his thoughts on sovereignty, constitutional matters, and the judiciary.\n\nTaylor saw that the United States had a unique chance to develop an ideal system since there were no entrenched traditions to constrain the founders, enabling them to create a system of self-governance. He was a strong advocate for natural rights, viewing them as interconnected—if one is denied, they all become compromised, reducing their significance. Thus, these rights should be out of government’s reach. He argued that the so-called \"state of nature\" allowed those with physical strength and cunning to thrive, but civilization should not follow this pattern.\n\nFor Taylor, building this ideal society required a government that acknowledged both the good and evil in people. He held a firm belief in dualistic morality, stating, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). Good principles, he claimed, were those that protected private property, enhanced agriculture, and resisted capitalism. A government grounded in these principles would operate justly regardless of its leadership, which would inevitably be driven by greed and self-interest. He saw self-interest as a universal human motivator but considered it negative only when it led to factions that thrived at others’ expense. A good government was essential to curb humanity’s inherent evil, and even then, it required vigilant oversight to prevent the adoption of harmful principles.\n\nLike many firm Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a highly restricted Federal government, limited to the powers explicitly granted by the Constitution. A large Federal government, he believed, was costly and prone to tyranny. However, he thought a simplistic literal reading was risky, potentially corrupt without considering the framers’ intentions. He regarded the Declaration of Independence as the true foundation of the United States, as it more clearly defined the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "I stared down, my mind blankly absorbing the scene before me. Without emotion or sound, I observed with a practiced eye, one that analyzed without connecting the subject to any abstract ideas. Thoughts flickered in and out of my mind so quickly it felt as if I had no real thoughts of my own, only a fluid experience of what I saw. Once, following advice from an artist I knew, I bought an art instruction book titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had wanted to learn to draw since I was six, and this book taught everything from the basics of a pencil to how the brain processes lines. One technique it suggested was to use a square frame to focus on any picture the artist wanted to study. This way, a complex scene, like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen opening to a dining room, could be simplified to just the bowl of fruit on a plain surface. At the time, as I looked down at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't imagine framing it like an artist. I was too overwhelmed, too amazed, that I could only stand there in awe. Picasso had his blue period, Monet loved greenery, and the Italian Renaissance masters used a spectrum of colors. If I dared to consider my perspective as artistic, this was the start of my picture, my story, Work in Brown. My fingers touched my chosen tool, muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand moved, my mind's intention taking form in what could have been my most creative moment. Water swirled, serene and clear. Bits of matter broke away and disappeared. Muscles tightened, my hand striking the toilet handle again with more urgency. The unpleasant brown mass wouldn't budge, stuck to the bottom like a slug. Holding the mop loosely, feet a foot apart, and a green tie uncomfortably snug around my neck, I frowned at the unpleasant heap of processed matter left as a message for those who cleaned the Rite Aid bathrooms. After a few more flushes and quiet, reflective moments, my hand reached for the toilet paper, wrapped around until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing straight, then bending at the waist, my hand lowered into the bowl like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "Teenagers are losing their lives in car accidents. Several factors contribute to this alarming trend among the youngest drivers in America. According to the National Institutes of Health, one issue is that the adolescent brain is not yet equipped to handle the dangers of driving. Inexperience is also a key factor, leading not only to more fatal crashes but also to an increased prevalence of vehicle rollovers, speeding incidents, and cars veering off the road. Teen drivers are particularly at risk when traveling with friends, a common occurrence as anyone with common sense might expect. Research by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a link between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents. \n\nTo enhance teen driver safety, California and other states have implemented temporary provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and ban other minors as passengers. However, I see these provisional licenses as temporary solutions. The fundamental problem is that, statistically, the youngest drivers are not yet capable of managing the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 may be too young for a standard driver's license. USA Today highlights Zuckerman's research, which shows that individuals under 19-20 often engage in risky behavior for excitement. Delaying driving until this thrill-seeking tendency diminishes seems logical. Continuing to issue licenses to young teens will likely result in more fatal accidents, with the death toll potentially soaring in the coming years. By 2010, the children of Baby Boomers will reach driving age, adding millions of new teen drivers to the roads.\n\nAddressing this issue through legislation would be relatively straightforward. Schools could still provide driver's education to prepare future drivers, but individuals under 18 would not be allowed to drive. A provisional permit could be granted before a full driver's license, with a requirement for a specific number of practical driving hours. This number could align with the current requirements in most states (such as California's requirement of six hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult). Since the troubling statistics for teen drivers are consistent across all states, a unified national law would be a sensible and effective approach to safeguarding teens nationwide. The legislation I propose is not entirely new.",
            "This paper explores three facets of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, it offers a concise definition of the disorder. It then discusses the diagnosis process, highlighting typical traits or \"red flags.\" Lastly, it suggests methods a teacher in a mainstream classroom can use to support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is concerned with how effectively and efficiently the central nervous system (CNS) uses auditory information. In a more specific sense, (C)AP involves the perceptual processing of auditory data within the CNS and the neurobiological activity that supports this processing, leading to electrophysiologic auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it is a disorder where the brain struggles to properly process auditory information. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally and are not classified as \"hearing impaired\"; instead, the brain region responsible for interpreting sounds, distinguishing words, or separating conversation from background noise does not operate as expected.\n\nThe concept that eventually became CAPD was first mentioned in the mid-1950s as “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), when researchers were examining children with communication disorders. An Italian research team led by Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started developing tests for these children in 1954, and in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and created a model to explain the central auditory nervous system's physiology relevant to dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 spurred further research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD can present in various ways: affected individuals might struggle to locate or hear sound spatially, differentiate between multiple sound occurrences, recognize sound patterns, detect changes in speech tone (like sarcasm), have one sound blocked by another, lack the ability to interpret sound cues meaningfully, and be unable to discern the sequence in which auditory information is delivered (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,\" performed by audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and other professionals using diverse measures to assess auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires, surveys, and observing auditory responses to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single tool or test that consistently achieves a high diagnostic success rate, and the disorder has no known cause. Many tests challenge the patient with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli, requiring them to differentiate items like a sequence of words or numbers. More advanced tests might involve recording acoustic signals in the ear and measuring responses to these signals.",
            "In my pursuit of a social work education, I aim to establish a career with the Division of Family and Children Services to support children who have faced abuse or neglect and to assist families in distress. The values I bring to the social work profession include service, respect, ethics, dedication to enhancing interpersonal relationships, and a commitment to my professional development to ensure my competence. These values are crucial not only to social workers but also to me personally.\n\nI have always had a desire to help others, although I was uncertain about which career path to take. During my high school and college years, I observed many people avoiding their problems or using poor coping strategies. Witnessing these situations led me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of my career direction, I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy at her home. She explained that he was there to escape his abusive parents. The following day, I found out he had contacted the police about his parents. I went to his parents’ house to see if I could assist. I privately expressed my concerns to the police and mentioned my recent Psychology degree. The police asked me to speak with the parents since the law couldn't intervene for the teenager. When I talked to the parents, they appeared uneasy and gave excuses about their son’s “manipulative” behavior in involving outsiders for \"simple\" family issues. This experience prompted me to seriously consider a career in social work to aid children with family “disputes.”\n\nAnother essential value in social work is social justice. While society claims to value individuals and mourns those we've lost, the societal concept of the “individual” is more about adhering to outdated traditions than embracing uniqueness. If we mourn lost individuals, why do we strive to conform to be like \"everyone else?\" I see myself as an individual and refuse to limit myself to conform. During my high school and college years, I consistently opposed social injustice: by dyeing my hair in unconventional colors, wearing clothes that expressed my personality, getting multiple ear piercings, joining the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and actively fighting against racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. I believe in social justice and will continue to oppose social injustice.",
            "This paper explores the Biological and Sociocultural models concerning the disorder of insomnia. The biological model emphasizes genetic inheritance and medical health aspects, while the Sociocultural models consider environmental interactions and their relevance to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The review of insomnia presented here examines these models, discussing each chosen research piece to enhance the understanding of the models. The research findings are critiqued, highlighting their particular strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder may be classified as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder linked to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder associated with other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, whereas sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are connected to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorders might result from medical issues or substance use. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in achieving or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is characterized by trouble staying awake, both persisting for at least one month. Narcolepsy is associated with cataplexy and/or automatic REM. Dyssomnias are concerned with initiating and maintaining sleep, whereas Parasomnias involve sleep disorders linked to abnormal behaviors or physiological events. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to other mental disorders involve sleep issues due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily focuses on insomnia and, to some extent, on primary sleep disorders in general, as they relate to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders examines genetic, heritable factors, and physiological aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study using mice found phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons specifically responsible for sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while its inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that animal models in mice can be applied to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence of this receptor could affect one's ability to sleep adequately without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if this phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and any alteration in the receptor could naturally disrupt an individual's sleep. This would negatively impact life aspects such as education, career, and daily activities requiring monotony and focus.",
            "I have been studying at University Park for roughly two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many, including myself. During my freshman year, I lived in a dorm in East Halls, which is nearly the farthest eastern point of campus, apart from the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes, especially in the often poor weather of State College. An alumnus, not much older than me, informed me that not long ago, East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the campus by large areas of unused land. Now, that space is occupied by sports fields, large new buildings like the Creamery and health services building, and surrounded by apartments. As our campus keeps growing, moving from one place to another becomes increasingly difficult. What is the best way to address mobility issues? On a college campus, bicycles are the answer. However, bikes alone aren't enough; students need to use them, and the campus should be designed to accommodate bicyclists' needs.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who started biking again after a break of several years. He remarked that he wondered why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are fantastic,\" he said. \"For a while, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only practical way to get around.\" Besides being beneficial for your health, biking is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off-campus, just as distant from the center as some dorms. The best decision I made this year was purchasing a bike. I have classes in the Thomas building every day, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. Cycling can reduce that time to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. The only issue is that Pollock Road, the most direct route to the Thomas building from my house, isn't always easy to navigate, whether on a bike or not. Walking has its advantages too, but I don't have the time to walk. Without my bike, walking would be my only dependable way to get to class, which would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily routine. That's more than two and a half hours each week, plus additional time spent walking to other classes and appointments. I simply can't afford that much time.",
            "In \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley critiques the looming dangers of technology and capitalism, which support a dystopian society. The novel's society prioritizes community over individuality, with citizens conditioned from birth to seek immediate happiness. These individuals are merely pieces in a larger scheme, restricted to a single ideology controlled by the World Controller. Viewed through a Marxist lens, the book reveals Huxley's skepticism about these systems. Marxist terms like homogeny and reification highlight the novel as a critique of the economic developments of Huxley's era.\n\nCapitalism is lampooned using the Marxist concept of false consciousness, which suggests that ordinary people are unaware of their true economic class relations, focusing instead on personal gain. This results from ideological control over the working class, as depicted by the conditioning in \"Brave New World.\" The lower classes, such as Delta and Gamma, lack genuine autonomy; hypnopædia intensifies their urge to consume and indulge above all else, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, where social classes are entirely dominated by another group, is evident here. The lower classes remain oblivious to their manipulation, essentially buying into an ideology that supports capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes might recognize this manipulation but typically do nothing, with few exceptions like Bernard. The interactions among social classes provide significant insight into the perceived oppression by capitalism.\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" true relationships between individuals are non-existent. The characters, even the main ones, lack depth, suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism robs people of free will and self-expression. Love and strong emotions are absent; interactions are shallow, as shown by men's comments on women's physical traits and women's candid discussions of their encounters. Additionally, each class's satisfaction with its social status reflects capitalism's socioeconomic impact. Their complete obedience within the community aligns with Marxist views on the proletariat, who are misled into believing in their superiority as long as they continue to consume, conform, and align with their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. One of the primary subjects of intense discussion was whether Islam is a hostile religion. I feel this question is more pertinent today than ever. Reflecting on events since 9/11, I have noticed the media's shift from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to a more extreme tolerance for Islam in America. Back in 2001, it would have been unimaginable for a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, whose family has a clear Muslim background, to emerge.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet fascinates me because, based on my knowledge of Muhammad's history, it seems to contradict his personality. Previously, I believed that Muhammad compelled conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and imposing the religion on them. However, the biography portrays Muhammad as a misunderstood martyr who humbled himself before others, leading people to gradually see the 'truth' in his teachings and seek him out.\n\nAdditionally, there are striking parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad. A notable example is when Muhammad multiplied mutton and milk to abundantly feed forty men. This style of writing suggests the authors aimed to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who lived in truth and miracles without needing validation. I find this problematic as it undermines the miracles and life of Jesus Christ, seemingly appropriating Jesus's legacy through Muhammad.\n\nThe biography also includes numerous stories suggesting an agenda to demonstrate 'witness' or show how people independently converted to Islam. The issue is that many stories are relayed from a third-party perspective, with the author narrating tales heard from others. This approach, intended to verify the truth of these stories, instead makes them appear more dubious to me.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a divine man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. However, history challenges the notion of Muhammad as a gentle and humble figure, and I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true historical context of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus during his lifetime were quickly set aside as Christian thought evolved after his death. Observing this history broadly, we notice a pattern of Christianity drifting further from its roots. In today's world, there is an increasing awareness and a strong progressive tendency. While there are still traditionalists who resist any new ideas beyond what they were taught, this group may not be influential enough to sway the entire population. Among Christians, historical awareness is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. There will be a widespread desire to differentiate the doctrines added to Christianity over time from the original intentions of its founder. This process may take decades or even centuries, but it seems inevitable: there will be a significant reversal in Christian history, moving back to its original form. A movement will arise, gradually peeling away layers of doctrine, as if turning back the clock, until only the original teachings of Jesus remain, before other thinkers contributed their interpretations. When this shift occurs in the United States and Europe, influencing many to worship as if they were living in Jesus' time and following only his teachings, the institutional church will remain strong to guide this change. However, as the theological clock rewinds, the current diversity in Christianity will give way to increasing uniformity in belief and practice. Instead of differences between regions, denominations, and divisions, there will be growing similarities. Human history is full of major reversions. For instance, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, which later became a Christian institution. Our country has transitioned from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The forthcoming major reversion will unfold within Christianity, reversing history to find its origins and reducing diversity in the process. A key aspect of this transformation will be interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically, not literally. So, what has happened since Jesus' time? Looking far back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological foundation of Christianity. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion. The Jewish community was not unified, dividing into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I think The Jungle illustrates how humans are inherently greedy and self-centered, primarily concerned with improving their own lives without caring for those beneath them. The novel highlights this through various examples, most notably the factory owners and managers who focus solely on expanding their businesses. They disregard anyone or anything that might suffer due to their progress. Upton Sinclair's narrative emphasizes the environmental damage caused by these factories, describing the buildings' silhouettes and the smoke spreading far and wide. Sinclair portrays the owners as indifferent to the harm caused to people and animals by pollution and waste from the stockyards.\n\nAdditionally, the owners and managers show no concern for the workers who generate their wealth. They prioritize profit over loyalty or decency, fostering a toxic atmosphere of jealousy and hatred. Workers endure long hours and face sudden layoffs without notice or support. During the time The Jungle is set, there were few, if any, laws safeguarding workers' rights, enabling managers to exploit employees by accelerating production and maintaining poor working conditions. Though the novel doesn't state it outright, those working in Packingtown were expected to endure these harsh conditions both at work and at home. There were no organizations to assist them, and unions often exploited them further. The workers, trapped in this oppressive system, were likened to slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is considered by Edgar Allan Poe to be among his finer poems. In this work, he uses the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which scholar Mabbott connects back to Virgil. Virgil referenced an island north of Britain, thought by the Greeks to be the world's edge, using this term. Although Virgil's usage is certain, there is a more contemporary influence that merits acknowledgment. Poe was notably interested in German writers. This detail highlights Poe's familiarity with Goethe's works. In his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" Karl J. Arndt discusses the likeness between their poems, suggesting Poe was emulating Goethe.\n\nAccording to the Oxford Companion to English Literature, Goethe was a renowned author of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Within the second part of \"Faust\" is a brief poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells of a king who, after his wife's death, drinks excessively and mourns her memory. Eventually, he decides to die, bequeathing his belongings to his children, except for a goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and dies. The king's demeanor in \"The King of Thulé\" mirrors the description of the king in \"Dream-Land,\" possibly reflecting Poe's own losses and struggles with alcohol. \"Faust\" was also adapted into a romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, just before Poe used the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe mentions Thule twice in his collected works. He references \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and uses this phrase twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as complementary pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes Thule as a dark, lonely place, haunted by the memory of deceased friends, and devoid of color. These elements echo \"The King of Thulé,\" where the king mourns his wife and loses his will to rule or live. The poem's imagery suggests the speaker has entered Goethe's narrative.\n\nGoethe was a significant literary figure whom Poe would have known, if only through his admiration for Tennyson. Poe, when asked about his opinion of Tennyson, acknowledged this connection. Beyond the Tennyson link, Poe would have encountered Goethe’s work through its many reproductions post-publication.",
            "Under California law, a customer injured from slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store might be entitled to punitive damages if it can be shown that the store manager acted with malice. This could be argued if the manager was twice informed about the spill and failed to clean it for half an hour because he was having dinner. It is unlikely that a judge would quickly dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive damages. To justify such a claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant acted with willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm their actions would cause, and that the behavior was egregious. Palmer could argue that Martin should have been aware of the potential harm of not addressing the spill, especially since multiple previous incidents of slipping had occurred at D&D in the months leading up to Palmer’s accident. Despite this awareness, Martin failed to clean the spill. Although Palmer’s argument that Martin’s conduct was egregious is less compelling, it remains reasonable considering that six slip-and-fall incidents were reported in 2009, yet Martin did not take adequate measures to ensure the store’s safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin replied that he was on his dinner break and couldn’t address customer complaints at that time. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin of the spill, and he gave the same response. At 5:30 pm on that day, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped on the spill and suffered a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident, five slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for both compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and there is consideration of filing a motion for partial summary judgment against the claim for punitive damages.\n\nIn California, punitive damages can be awarded for a breach of obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud, or malice” as per Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The law defines malice as actions intended to cause harm, or if not intentional, then “despicable” actions carried out with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have deemed conduct malicious when it is done with conscious disregard for the plaintiff’s rights, where the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "She had always felt an unfulfilled longing. This yearning began when she was around 14, as she entered her teenage years, and persisted at 17. By then, she realized she sought a person rather than a thing, yet had no interest in the boys around her. Some boys showed interest in her and awkwardly tried to win her over, but none caught her attention. She often questioned this peculiar feeling, pondering what could cause such an unusual situation for a teenage girl. Years of reflection brought theories, but none substantial enough to satisfy her curiosity. Thus, she continued living, perpetually questioning her desires.\n\nA typical day at home was peaceful. Her parents were calm and kind, rarely arguing with each other or with her. The only disputes arose when their daughter asserted her independence and free spirit. Despite being the child of a serene couple, she contrasted their energy with her vibrant personality, making her well-liked.\n\nHowever, today was not a calm day. As she moved through the house seeking inspiration, she heard a brief scream from the kitchen, her mother's beautiful voice. She rushed in, panicking, and asked, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the floor, in pain, repeatedly saying \"Ow\" with short breaths. The daughter hurried to her side, trying to help. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital,\" her mother said, the words strained and hurried, revealing her agony. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up,\" she responded. Her mother gestured, and at that moment, the daughter felt grateful for the strength training she had undergone. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the backseat, and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was filled with the smell of disinfectant, sickness, and a hint of fear. However, her focus was solely on helping her mother. She quickly carried her mother inside and called for medical assistance. Several concerned faces appeared, and someone brought a rolling bed, laying her mother on it and taking her for immediate examination, leaving the daughter to wait anxiously.\n\nHer mother had fallen off a stepping stool while trying to reach a vase from the highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", correlates with a decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke-related deaths. The aMed diet is a modified version of the traditional Med diet, emphasizing a higher intake of plant-based foods, such as plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (as opposed to saturated fats), and fish, while reducing the consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown an inverse relationship between following a Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial also found the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in obese individuals. However, earlier studies did not specifically examine stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological research tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who had no history of CVD or diabetes and were part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) intended to assess nutrient intake over the past year. Over 95% of the nurses remained involved throughout the 20-year span. The FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were deemed \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions classified this way. For each FFQ, body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated, and leisure-time physical activity was assessed starting in 1986.\n\nTo minimize random variation for an individual and better reflect long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were computed (averaging scores from the previous two years). Adjustments for potential confounders, such as age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use, were made.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the association between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a reduced risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up, there were 2,391 new cases of CHD, 1,763 new cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (including fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the top quintile of aMed scores had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.71.",
            "The sign reads, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" \n\nEllen Page, known for her role in Juno, stands by herself on a street corner, holding a cardboard sign overhead with this disturbing message written in Sharpie. Burma, also referred to as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a brutal military junta that seized power in a 1962 coup. In 2007, the country witnessed its first public demonstrations in a decade, led primarily by Buddhist monks. These protests, dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution\" due to the color of the monks' robes, initially attracted broader public support. Although the government initially tolerated the monks' peaceful assemblies, the situation quickly escalated into what many viewed as a full-scale conflict between the monks and the military regime, with the military launching raids on monasteries nationwide. Foreign journalists were arrested immediately, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed on September 27th, 2007, for attending a street protest. While official reports claim 13 deaths, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army shortly before the official announcement, reported that the actual number of deaths was in the thousands.\n\nThese events are not unique. While they are recent examples of global atrocities, the suppression of dissent and the pursuit of absolute control by governments have been present throughout history. Early Roman emperors claimed divine selection for their absolute rule, while Japanese emperors were considered deities, believed to guide their people to success through innovations like Motorola phones and ritual suicide. Similarly, President George W. Bush reportedly held weekly calls with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, linked to the Republican Party.\n\nNotable historical examples include the June 4th, 1989, protests in Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students protested against government authoritarianism. The death toll estimates vary significantly, from the Chinese government's report of 200-300 deaths to the Chinese Red Cross's claim of 2,000-3,000 deaths. Another instance is the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s, where Hutu militias, with government support, systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of ethnicity. Hitler’s Third Reich, during which Jews were systematically persecuted and exterminated across several countries, stands as another extreme example.",
            "Duke Ellington's significant contribution to jazz largely stems from his long career and his exceptional skill in shaping his orchestra. While his piano presence is understated in many compositions chosen for this task, Ellington's brilliance as a composer lies in his ability to create intricate and multifaceted pieces that highlighted the unique talents of his band members. He devised a structure within which soloists could improvise freely, while also crafting carefully orchestrated segments tailored to the distinct styles of his musicians to bring out specific musical ideas. Through this, he emphasized the overall tone of the orchestra, producing cohesive and original sounds for each piece. Ellington's deep understanding of each player's sound, along with their integration into a larger ensemble, allowed him to compose some of jazz's most groundbreaking and remarkable works.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes Ellington's innovative sound, citing \"Creole Love Call\" as an early example of his use of the voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This piece demonstrates how Ellington used voice to add texture and richness, without relying on lyrics, and showcases his skill in complementing his soloists' styles, a hallmark throughout his career. The slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece features six choruses:\n\n- Chorus 1: A call and response between voice and reeds, starting smoothly and melodically, then shifting to a harsher tone.\n- Chorus 2: A muted trumpet solo elaborates on the melody, emphasizing extended blue notes.\n- Chorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, with a subtle syncopated piano backdrop.\n- Chorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response between brass and reeds.\n- Chorus 5: The climactic chorus, with reeds initiating the call and response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop-time from brass and rhythm sections.\n- Chorus 6: Returns to the structure of the first chorus, featuring a call and response between voice and reeds, with the voice using the \"growl\" technique, soloing like an instrument.\n- Tag: A brief vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add tonal color to this piece is a stylistic feature that is evident throughout his body of work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington combines his expertise in tight orchestration with his sensitivity to tone color. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing blends Miley's vocal trumpet style with Cox's instrumental-sounding voice, creating a rich and complementary sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" expands on these concepts, with Ellington effectively employing Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a key figure in Ellington's orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "What drives the specific path of evolutionary change in organisms? Are there particular limitations that steer the course of evolution? As early as 1917, D’Arcy Thompson remarked that even the simplest organic forms were challenging to express in mathematical terms—a sentiment that remains relevant today. However, the application of mathematical modeling to general aspects of mollusk shell formation, considering both their development and evolutionary history, has been explored by researchers like Raup and Stanley in 1981. Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of changes in Prunum, alongside experimental studies, can clarify the mechanisms determining the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental changes. We employed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to define quantitative parameters for modeling both theoretical and actual shell shapes. These parameters were input into the software CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We created models of hypothetical shell forms to interpret the potential limits of morphological changes in Prunum. These findings are integrated with experimental and descriptive research to enhance the understanding of large-scale evolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be conceptualized as a tube that progresses through time, rotating 360 degrees in space. These rotations of a coiled shell are known as whorls, spiraling around an imaginary central axis called the columella, which runs through the shell's center. The rate at which the whorls expand can vary, with a continuous line, the suture, marking the separation between each whorl. Typically, the largest whorl is the final one, known as the body whorl. All whorls except the last make up the spire, with the apex at the spire's tip and the base at the opposite end. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The standard orientation is the apertural view, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex pointing upward.\n\nThe following is a method for counting whorls. Begin by viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identify where the first suture starts. A line is then drawn to divide the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be considered as a sequence of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be tracked using the coordinates of each whorl’s aperture center, along with the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis path can be depicted graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical model is established, it allows for the adjustment of parameters and modification of the mollusk’s shell formation process.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have shown little change. Although the country is progressing towards achieving several Millennium Development Goals, including those related to water and sanitation, the advancements in child and maternal health fall significantly short of the targets set for 2015. The reasons for this shortfall will be explored further, suggesting the need for a stronger health system rather than solely program-focused interventions.\n\nImprovements have been made in the number of births attended by skilled health workers, with 72% now meeting this standard. However, this figure includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who may not be equipped to handle complex medical situations, leading to a high rate of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. Thus, while progress in this area appears positive, it is somewhat deceptive, indicating much more work remains. Additionally, there has been a reduction in the proportion of children under five with diarrhea receiving professional medical treatment. Incomplete data on postnatal care highlights another area of concern, as rates remain low nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates are lower than expected, at about 4%. This statistic reveals another troubling issue; while urban areas have a c-section rate of 7%, rural areas have only 2%, highlighting a disparity in healthcare access across the country. Access to healthcare is concentrated in urban zones, and vertical equity is also a challenge. A 27% difference in service use exists between the poorest and wealthiest groups, indicating that the poor face greater challenges accessing healthcare, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn considering future steps to improve neonatal and maternal health indicators, the fundamental question is how best to address the service gaps. Should Indonesia focus on specific programs or enhance the overall health system, without prioritizing pre- and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children? Programmatic approaches are appealing because they offer specific, manageable goals and often deliver quicker outcomes. However, there are notable drawbacks. A significant issue is that focusing resources on one area can divert funding from others, drawing human resources to areas with more funding, as seen with international HIV/AIDS funding impacting the family planning sector. Additionally, having multiple parallel programs for the same area can lead to service duplication and lack of coordination, increasing paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "Over the past century, the categorization of Popular Music has expanded so extensively that it's challenging to enumerate all the genres definitively. Adding to the complexity, nearly every genre—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—has given rise to numerous sub-genres and even further subdivisions. Among these, the Heavy Metal rock sub-genre has arguably emerged as one of the most varied and expressive in popular music over the last 40 years. Its expressiveness is due to its wide emotional range, often skewing toward darker themes. Its diversity stems from the genre's inherent flexibility, recognized early on, which allowed people to create their own sub-genres, followed by further subdivisions, a trend that continues today.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal scene has evolved to encompass so many niche groups that defining heavy metal precisely is challenging. While it now incorporates many elements from other genres, like all music, it originated from a specific point. To truly understand the metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp what the metal movement represents and why it's considered a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nIn many respects, metal is a movement characterized by darkness. It can be described as \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more aggression, more drama. It involves less primitiveness and more technical skill, with band members demonstrating considerable proficiency with their instruments. Metal is also, unsurprisingly, a movement deeply influenced by drug use. The psychedelic drug surge in the mid-70s prompted people to create wild, otherworldly records, using drugs as a catalyst for their creativity. Metal contains many dark, intense qualities, which was quite novel for the music scene, as much of popular music lacked such dark emotional depth. Additionally, later metal generations drew inspiration from the dark, intense qualities prevalent during the Romantic Era. Lyrics like those from \"Helter Skelter\" illustrate the darkness essential to the movement:\n\nThese lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" reveal the darker aspect of the Beatles, reflecting the highs and lows often associated with drug influence. This song is considered by some to be among the earliest Heavy Metal songs. It was crafted as a response to a Rolling Stones track, which also leaned towards a heavier, darker tone. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate that they could match the Stones' heaviness, leading them to include this song on The White Album.",
            "Several decades before the Surrealist artists began creating their dreamlike artworks, Henri Rousseau was meticulously crafting his personal dreams, both in a literal and figurative sense. \"The Dream,\" a painting completed in 1910 by the renowned Post-Impressionist artist, not only depicts a woman amazed by the wonders of a dreamland but also embodies Rousseau's own aspirations and ambitions as a painter. From the start of his artistic journey, he longed for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, facing a challenging internal struggle to achieve this dream. \"The Dream\" is the piece that most accurately mirrors Rousseau's enduring internal conflict: whether to conform to or imitate specific art styles to gain acceptance in the critical art world he cherished or to maintain his creative independence and uniqueness, forging his own path.\n\nTo fully understand \"The Dream\" from this viewpoint, one must first have some knowledge of Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France, Henri Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed middle-class prosperity (Shattuck 47). He had no formal art education during his upbringing; instead, he worked for the French municipal toll service, known as a gabelou, until the age of forty, though he mistakenly earned the nickname douanier, or customs inspector (Shattuck 46). After the death of his first wife, Clémence, and the loss of eight infant children, Rousseau was left with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and deep sorrow (Shattuck 49). Seeking solace in a new life, he turned to painting for comfort and a fresh start. Unlike his contemporaries who often romanticized the peasant in their works, Rousseau was essentially a folk artist, embodying the hopes and dreams of the average person from his social class.\n\nRousseau's obsession with gaining acceptance in the art world is somewhat understandable when considered in context: as mentioned, he was not formally trained in painting and began his career much later in life, competing with many talented and more renowned modern artists. Despite years of work, Rousseau only began to receive the recognition he sought around the same time that Matisse was establishing his reputation. In \"Modern French Painters,\" author Jan Gordon notes that while Rousseau and Matisse were technically competitors, they differed not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations for painting: \"Matisse was a painter who feared producing clichéd works, whereas Rousseau aimed to create art so conventional that it would earn him entry into the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "Numerous great thinkers have suggested that there is a deep link between ethics and aesthetics, and between truth and beauty. I believe there is a fundamental reason for this. John Keats expresses this idea in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" when he writes, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our knowledge comes from education or experience, but as Keats implies, we seem to understand ethics and aesthetics without formal teaching. Both fields aim to describe rather than prescribe. Our exploration of morality and beauty largely involves explaining why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than providing rules for creating good art or moral behavior. Critiques of art or morals can never fully capture what makes something good or beautiful. For instance, discussions about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa often focus on aspects like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't fully explain why it is considered good art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often say, \"There's just something about it,\" before giving a more detailed explanation. I believe that both art and morals cannot be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor notes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe the features of a literary work, there remains something transcendent. I think ethics shares this quality. Wittgenstein says, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that this \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, is the most powerful attribute of art and morality, and that the transcendental nature of both provides a link between them. I believe that morality and art are closely connected because we experience them most profoundly at a noumenal level, a Kantian term meaning they affect us in a way that can be felt but not fully explained. This connection is even stronger in the art of literature. As McKean states, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. Moral standards may not apply to other arts, like music, but they are as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Modern Germany is recognized as a formidable and unified nation, characterized by a diverse culture stretching from the shadows of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This cultural richness is evident from Cologne on the Rhine, through the heart of Germany, to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. With such a distinct culture, it is understandable that contemporary Germany has roots in various tribes and sources.\n\nGermania is the ancestral homeland of the Germans, and the origin of its name is a topic of debate among scholars and historians. Tacitus suggested that the name derived from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were referred to as Germans before crossing the Rhine to fight the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first mentioned the term \"Germanus\" in his account of the Gallic Wars, where he described his conquests over the Gauls and battles with Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine with dubious intentions. He adopted this term from the Gauls themselves to differentiate between the conquered Gauls and the unconquered tribes. Although the precise origin remains uncertain, some speculate it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish tongue. In the opening chapter of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar wrote: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others suggest the name might have originated from the spear used in warfare, called a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or possibly from the Old Irish word garim, meaning \"to shout,\" implying the Germans were loud or boisterous. (Names of Germany)\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work “De Origine et situ Germanorum,” documented the origins of the Germans, noting that he viewed them as indigenous, unmixed with other races through migration or interaction. He argued that in earlier times, migrations occurred by sea rather than land, leading him to question why anyone would leave Asia or Africa for Germany, with its harsh climate and severe demeanor, unless it was their homeland. (Tacitus, 98)\n\nWhy would anyone leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, at least not yet. They would launch expeditions into Germania for goods and occasionally conduct land campaigns, but they predominantly returned to their vast empire. As Germanic tribes emerged in the mid-first century, they lived along the Roman Empire's borders, trading resources and serving in the Roman army ranks. (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "The play Twelfth Night suggests that while disguises can effectively enable prolonged deception, ultimately, one must abandon these false identities or risk losing their true self. A significant challenge in ending such deceit is the potential for alienation. Thus, a person must choose between preserving their own identity or maintaining relationships with others. Some individuals may react indifferently to being deceived, but others may be deeply offended by the masquerade.\n\nThe theme of deception through gender role reversal is particularly complex, raising questions about why someone might feel compelled to adopt a disguise of the opposite gender. In Viola’s situation, her disguise serves as a means of protection: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Upon arriving in a foreign land, Viola disguises herself as a man to safeguard herself from potential threats. While her plan is successful, it also isolates her from the women around her, severing an important support network. Compounding the issue, her male disguise is so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, Viola grapples with unspoken romantic tensions with Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo a modern audience, Twelfth Night might be viewed as showing how deception can reveal hidden emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain parts of the play suggest that these characters might have latent desires that are brought to the surface by Viola/Cesario’s presence. For example, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because she believes Cesario is a man, or does she secretly have feelings for women? It seems unlikely, as Shakespeare’s Olivia appears to mock people of his era who judge others based solely on appearance. This is demonstrated by how easily Olivia shifts her affections from Cesario to Sebastian and starts to see Cesario/Viola as a sibling rather than a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German colonial rule is often criticized for its harshness, particularly regarding the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa. Nonetheless, it is overly simplistic to characterize an entire colonial empire with such a broad brush. The German colonial empire featured a variety of policies and governing styles that differed across its geographic expanse. Similarly, the approach to education varied throughout the colonies. When the British took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a significant number of educated and literate Africans. German educational initiatives in Kamerun and other colonies also received commendation from contemporary writers. The situation in South West Africa (now Namibia) was markedly different. Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and was actively involved in educating the natives, education in South West Africa was largely left to missionary societies with minimal government backing. However, the government did allocate considerable resources to the education of Europeans in the colony, setting up state schools and providing more substantial support and regulation for missionary schools. These educational strategies left a lasting impact on South West Africa, persisting even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies had significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to the distinct experience of South West Africa. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors and focus on new research concerning the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is a substantial body of literature focused specifically on education within the German colonial empire. Most of these works are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The primary goal of these early writings was to describe the educational systems in these colonies. Later English-language publications broadened the discussion through comparative studies of educational practices across different German colonies and more in-depth analyses of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant variations in the educational systems across different colonies. One of the most notable works that explicitly addresses the subject of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of these two colonies and explores the factors that explain the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa accounts for many of the distinctive characteristics of the colony’s educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial holdings, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, although much of it consisted of arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans resided in South West Africa, whereas the next largest settler population was in East Africa, with only 5,336 Europeans.",
            "The United States and Mexico serve as an example of two countries that were once embroiled in a long-lasting rivalry spanning 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, gaining Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Numerous other conflicts occurred between the two nations, eventually subsiding just before World War I. The rivalry was fueled by clashes over key issues such as religion, culture, tradition, and significant material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis situation is similar to many other countries with enduring rivalries with neighboring nations. Countries sharing a border often have conflicting interests that lead to rivalries. The United States and Mexico exemplify such enduring border rivalries. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, both countries are geographically close to the United States and have been its rivals, whereas other Latin American nations have generally maintained good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences were a significant source of tension between the two countries, a problem that has historically affected many nations. Sally Frahm (2001) observes that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). Similar to the ideological and interest-based Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, the U.S.-Mexico tensions were rooted in religious preferences rather than political structures. This mistrust stemmed from the historical distrust between the English and Spanish, which both countries inherited from their colonial rulers, hindering the development of positive foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during this 57-year period of rivalry. Most of these disputes revolved around territorial issues, particularly border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier challenges. Raids by bandits and outlaws on American border towns persisted until both nations asserted military force along their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). Schmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry began to diminish as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and eventually ended as American priorities shifted \"from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p. 110) in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I unexpectedly became disabled due to an illness I had never heard of before. At that time, I was working as a nurse, a career I chose because it offered the stability and security I lacked during my childhood. The advice I frequently heard growing up was, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" Although my true aspiration was to be a scientist or journalist, or perhaps both, I opted for nursing.\n\nHowever, at 46, I found myself single, without savings, and unable to work. Even now, after 15 years on Social Security Disability, I have nothing to my name. I manage to get by, but each day is a battle affecting my sense of safety, security, and self-worth. While nothing in my life is predictable anymore, I do know one thing: I couldn't have survived these years without the support of my family and a few close friends. In times of true crisis, no matter how strong you think you are, you don't feel strong at all.\n\nMy point is that life will always have emergencies, both big and small, and no matter how well-prepared you are, some challenges are too significant to handle alone. I agree that in the U.S., we should stop relying solely on big government, which is deteriorating. Instead, I would prefer Americans to learn to trust and support one another, rather than each person retreating to build their own fallout shelters.\n\nConservatives in the U.S. often speak of \"rugged individualism\" as the foundation of our country, but in reality, what sustained our ancestors during tough times was compassion, mutual respect, and resource-sharing. The pioneers who traveled in wagon trains across the Rockies didn't reach the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in case of a biological attack. I have several flashlights, a variety of batteries, plenty of candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have land and resources for a small farm and the ability to preserve your own food, do it. It's a smart idea, as is having a wood stove, provided you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while doing all this, take the time to get to know your neighbors.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince destined to be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he gave up worldly possessions, achieved enlightenment, and his teachings eventually led to the creation of Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being its most traditional branch. Buddhism is approximately 2,500 years old, and it has evolved since the time of Buddha, evident in practices like the annual water-cutting ceremony in Theravada Buddhist Sri Lanka. This event, involving both monks and laypeople, holds religious significance, even though Buddha never mentioned such celebrations. Variations span from minor traditions to the fundamental beliefs of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both monastic and lay, has had to adapt its doctrines over time due to both internal and external influences, some of which were supportive and others adversarial.\n\nSeveral key terms are frequently used in this discussion. Internal forces originate from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic involvement, while external forces arise from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces aim to harm the Buddhist community, stemming from negative views of Buddhism, whereas benign forces neither intend to harm nor help Buddhism, although they may inadvertently do so. These terms recur throughout the discourse.\n\nTo begin, one must understand the fundamentals of the religion—the central doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka or three baskets of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka includes all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains Buddhism's metaphysical aspects. These metaphysical ideas include Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—life’s inherent suffering, and Anicca—the impermanence of all things. Understanding these concepts is essential to ending Sansara, the ongoing cycle of death and rebirth. With the cessation of Sansara comes the end of lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, upon reaching enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka establishes life rules: for laypeople, the five precepts are refraining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and consuming intoxicants. Monks have additional disciplinary rules. The core doctrinal concept in Buddhism is the four noble truths: first, Dukkha, the truth that life involves suffering; second, the truth that attachment causes suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture plays a crucial role in negotiations. It can be as much about what it is not as what it is and what it represents. Culture is neither uniform nor a singular entity. Generalizations such as \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While it’s useful to understand cultural generalizations, negotiators benefit more from grasping the significance of culture on the issue at hand and how cultural attitudes might influence discussions. When encountering a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that relates to their own culture, naturally leading to comparisons.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset may involve studying its history or recognizing its biases. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, one should accept it and work within its parameters, particularly in negotiations, especially if one is negotiating from a weaker position. Similarly, when a negotiator is in unfamiliar territory, respecting traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and progress the negotiation.\n\nIt is essential to recognize that culture doesn't solely exist on a national or international level. Companies within a nation often develop their own corporate cultures. For example, a corporate culture might prioritize long office hours or a more flexible schedule. Corporate culture can be observed in employee dress codes, communication styles (direct versus indirect communication, delegation of responsibilities), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, while others limit it to \"company-approved\" charities or fundraisers. Variations in American corporate culture from company to company (and even within different regions, urban versus suburban environments) highlight the diversity of thought within a societal culture. Certain cultures may seem less stratified than American culture and appear more uniform to outsiders, but this similarity invites deeper exploration.\n\nUnderstanding values is even more important, as they explain the reasons behind a culture. If saving face or maintaining communal harmony is valued, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superior to succeed in negotiations. Similarly, a negotiator from a culture that values hard bargaining won't necessarily rush to settle. Considering these generalities is crucial before negotiating. However, learning about one's opponent on a personal level enhances the effectiveness of negotiations.",
            "The phrase \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God,’\" first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and serves as the starting point for St. Anselm's argument about God's existence. This perspective is also shared by Thomas Aquinas, another author under discussion. Since both argue in favor of the same idea, and our task is to evaluate which argument is stronger, we must assume, for simplicity, that both are correct in their belief in the existence of the God depicted in the Bible. Considering a different type of deity would not allow for a fair comparison of their arguments, as both authors essentially defend a specific concept of God. With that in mind, I propose that while each presents valid points, neither offers a comprehensive foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo support this assertion, we will first look at St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm's passage suggests a path to understanding through faith, by introspection to find evidence of God. He argues that since God exists within our comprehension, we cannot truly imagine His nonexistence. Although his terminology can be lengthy and somewhat unclear, the main idea is that the proof of God resides in one's own mind. St. Anselm implies that we do not need to look beyond ourselves to discover the truth about God; His existence is evident by examining what we inherently know to be true within our minds. External evidence is presumably unnecessary. This acceptance of something without irrefutable empirical evidence is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nThis concept contrasts with that of St. Thomas Aquinas, who argues that God's existence can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, without relying on faith. This approach could be advantageous for evangelism, a key aspect of Christianity, as it would allow for the conversion of new believers based solely on logic, without requiring acceptance of unprovable claims. St. Thomas presents five logical arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each, he essentially shows that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for His existence. Just as you can deduce the characteristics and existence of a missing puzzle piece without seeing it, logic dictates that God's existence can be inferred.",
            "Various authors employ diverse methods to evoke specific emotions or attitudes in their readers regarding significant topics, and some techniques prove more effective than others. In his novel, The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald employs several such methods. Occasionally, he combines an adjective and a noun in unusual pairings to create a particular atmosphere surrounding a subject. At other times, he assigns symbolic meaning to an object and uses it for the same purpose. Fitzgerald extensively uses this technique with colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, he imbues colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, with specific meanings, which he later uses to evoke certain feelings associated with important elements.\n\nFitzgerald associates white/gray with uniformity, where white suggests a more refined and upper-class quality, while gray conveys an older and faded aspect. He establishes these meanings early in the novel through frequent references. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are consistently described as being \"in white\" (8)—indeed, almost everyone is depicted in white: Nick attends Gatsby's party in \"white flannels\" (41), Tom wears a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only exception is when Nick observes Gatsby's party, where \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further defines these colors by associating them with mundane or insignificant subjects: as Nick heads to work, he travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the guest list at Gatsby's parties becomes \"gray names\" (61) on Nick’s timetable, and Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—indicating uniformity (28). He also uses white or gray to describe ordinary people or locations: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" at the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established the significance of white/gray, he employs them to indicate unimportance or uniformity in certain subjects. This use of color symbolism begins with Daisy. After a period without notable mentions of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" prompting readers to perceive her as less of an individual character and more as a uniform object, something Gatsby desires (74). Fitzgerald continues to use this color symbolism around Daisy to reinforce the notion of her as a uniform addition, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18), and once again, she is in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County boasts a highly productive agricultural sector due to its mild and sunny climate. The region typically grows crops such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, and tree fruits like peaches and lemons, along with berries, honey, and peppers. There is a strong demand for organic community-supported agriculture in the San Diego area, with many organizations having long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Numerous organic farms offer guided tours of their farming practices and provide opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other leisure activities. This type of operation enables landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitats, allowing for recreational use and creating opportunities for farm tours and educational programs. \n\nOrganic farming presents a lucrative niche market and often leads to increased biodiversity in plants and wildlife, as it avoids using chemicals in the soil and water. However, it can be more costly than conventional farming due to the need for more labor and management to control pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals. Organic farms tend to experience higher losses and lack the economies of scale of larger operations. Practices beneficial to wildlife, though not exclusively tied to organic farming, may also involve higher labor costs, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, removing invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create specific conditions like edge habitats or open ground patches. Therefore, the landowner in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land chosen for this scenario is a 160-acre parcel near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It includes chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This area is part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion under the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan, currently under review, considers over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, while others like burrowing owls are declining and may soon be listed.\n\nHistorically, this area was inhabited by Native Americans for countless generations and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The land was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing or wood production over the decades. To explore realistic options for a small farmer to reduce costs and maintain wildlife-friendly practices, I selected a property from a real estate website and researched available government programs. As an example of what farming this land might entail, I identified an organic farm in the same area.",
            "The connection between brothers is a powerful and unyielding bond, filled with a myriad of emotions such as love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers possess a deep understanding of each other, unmatched by any other relationship, and see themselves reflected in one another. It is in moments of crisis that the true essence of this bond is revealed, whether for better or worse. The clarity of these emotions comes at a significant cost, and part of comprehending them involves facing the consequences they bring. When a brother gazes into another's eyes and sees his own likeness, he perceives himself not as others do, but as he truly is. The essence of their character is found in their actions and the repercussions of those actions. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme and the turbulent emotions it entails. Against a richly described backdrop, these boys embark on a hopeless journey. The climactic scene sees deep disappointment collide with fierce pride, resulting in only one brother surviving. The theme is conveyed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator’s perspective, which communicates the complex emotions the protagonist experiences and his perception of the world, both of which strongly influence his actions. The protagonist’s behavior is driven by one central emotion: pride. From his first outings with his younger brother, Doodle, to their final, tragic adventure, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He desired a brother to whom he could impart all his worldly skills, like \"...holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He longed for a companion to race to Horsehead Landing and to accompany him atop the great pine behind the barn. However, Doodle's condition made these dreams impossible. Born with a frail heart, Doodle's survival was uncertain, and engaging in strenuous physical activity was nearly out of the question. This was a heavy blow to the young protagonist, whose head was filled with grand fantasies, only to see them shattered in an instant. In fact, he even admits to feeling anger towards the child, recalling thoughts of suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would contemplate such an act? Yet, his heart softens when the child smiles at him, a simple gesture that filled him with hope. This suggests that his intent was not strong, as deep down, he had an innate love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex and imaginative system for processing information. As technology evolved from basic to advanced, the metaphors used to describe the brain also changed. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, followed by a book, and most recently, a computer. When studying the brain, it is important to remember that these metaphors have limitations and can lead to incorrect assumptions.  \nInformation processing begins with input from sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light photons into electrochemical signals. The brain’s algorithms repeatedly transform this sensory information through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles basic details such as color, orientation, and object borders—where color changes sharply in a small area—to determine that a box is being seen. Top-down processing leverages decisions made during bottom-up processing to expedite recognizing the box. In this scenario, top-down processing might help identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped void in the white background.  \nAfter a certain level of processing, an attention filter determines the significance of the signal and which cognitive processes should access it. For example, though your brain processes each blade of grass when you glance at your shoes, a functioning attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. Conversely, you might notice your name even amid a noisy environment. There are several stages of processing, and attention continuously influences the results.  \nFor the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, with specific encoding methods for each type of sensory input. For example, verbal input can be encoded based on its structure—what the printed word looks like, phonemically—what the word sounds like, or semantically—what the word means. Once stored, information must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which retains information for about 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal cycling through a specific series of neurons for a short duration. Information in long-term memory is believed to be preserved in the structure of certain protein types.  \nThere are various models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, some derived from how humans recall memories, others from computer science, and still others from neurophysiology. The semantic network model suggests that concepts are represented by nodes, which are interconnected based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which could be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a severe financial crisis. Unemployment surged, the housing market collapsed, and numerous significant American corporations were devastated. This recession continues today, prompting us to ask: what caused this crisis, and how can it be prevented? Essentially, the crisis was the result of self-serving and shortsighted political decisions that compelled banks and companies to issue sub-prime loans within a fragile financial framework. At the same time, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and bundle these mortgages into complex financial instruments like CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves and passed the turmoil onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold, impacting the wider economy.\n\nThe crisis's origins trace back to 1999 during Clinton's presidency, as he sought re-election by boosting his popularity. To achieve this, the Clinton administration eased lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999 that \"Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes accurately predicted the potential fallout: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As highlighted earlier, and as Holmes anticipated, reckless lending would inevitably lead to economic collapse.\n\nVarious factors contributed to the economic downturn, one being the novel and intricate mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were heavily utilized in the years preceding the crisis, further entangling more economic sectors with the housing market. This led U.S. households and financial markets to overextend themselves in the housing sector, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nUltimately, the housing bubble burst, and financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities suffered. In 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts, accounting for about 30% of the nation’s GDP. As a result, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at low prices, Lehman Brothers was disbanded, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to convert into commercial banks under strict regulation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That point in your narrative where you spread your writerly wings and soar, mesmerizing everyone with your captivating, even enchanting, prose. Or it's the moment when your readers doze off or hit the \"Back\" button, cursing your name. Dr. Merlin is known to yell at her screen when she encounters an overload of information, and not in a pleasant way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy gentle readers are familiar with the fundamental writing advice, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself in extensive sections of text where nothing, or too much, occurs. Exposition is the mischievous imp whispering to you to dispense with the history to reach the exciting parts (not to be mistaken for the imp on the other shoulder urging the author to divulge every detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition involves informing the audience of what happened, usually in straightforward prose. In film, exposition occurs when one character relays a deluge of information to another, much like in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author conveying the details.\n\nAn example might help. While reading a story, you learn that the heroine met her beloved at a particular place and time, they wed in grand fashion, and her husband was murdered before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to span two pages with each having only two lines of dialogue. You'd anticipate the author spending time on the husband's character, illustrating through his words and actions how deeply he loves his wife. Similarly, you would expect the heroine to demonstrate, through various means, how much his presence transformed and enriched her life (especially if the story later explicitly states this). Properly introducing the husband's character would enable you to become emotionally invested in his fate, providing insight into the heroine's character: what drew her to him, the depth of their bond, clues about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as seen through his eyes, and so on. You would grieve his death alongside her, thereby deepening your connection to the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you'd expect substance on the bare storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your responsibility to add that substance. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, continues*) There's often a temptation to gloss over certain details. Maybe you're introducing a new character and you know he was in the Air Force, he's the night manager of a gas station now, he's been married twice, has no kids, enjoys fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was a live broadcast from NBC 4 on the morning of August 13, 2011. The main story covered a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. They didn't mention her name but showed his mugshot, describing him as looking quite menacing. The report was brief, lasting about two minutes, as the story was still developing. The only details provided were that he had stabbed her several times and had been arrested. I felt the coverage was appropriately timed.\n\nThe second story involved an early morning shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area, leaving him critically injured with no arrests or suspects identified at that time. The SWAT Team was investigating. This story also seemed short, possibly because it involved a black man or was set in a predominantly black neighborhood. I've noticed for years that crimes involving minority victims often receive less attention. If the victim is a white child or adult, the media tends to give it much more coverage.\n\nThe next report was about a gunshot hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. They shared details about where they believed the incident occurred and determined it was hit by a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nAnother story was about predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to stay in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. This segment was brief, likely meant as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nThey also reported on a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie, approximately six feet tall and weighing around 150 pounds. I felt they spent an unusual amount of time focusing on his race and skin color.\n\nAnother story covered Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin found guilty of conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, they mentioned his sentence as \"300 months\" instead of 25 years, which seemed to emphasize the severity. They also noted he was Hispanic, though it didn't seem relevant to the case.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of security intended to follow an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund, but it offers more flexibility and can be traded like a stock on an exchange. An ETF provides the diversification benefits of an index fund along with the advantages of owning individual stocks, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as little as one share per transaction. Despite these appealing features, ETFs have significantly lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund. However, there are some drawbacks, such as the necessity to pay a commission for any ETF trade, akin to a stock order. Another advantage of ETFs is the vast array of funds available. While these benefits are clearly outlined, a prudent financial investor should assess whether the stated benefits, such as diversification, truly exist and to what degree. For this purpose, we will analyze the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to see if the advantages of owning a single ETF are comparable to those of holding a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, and whether there are better configurations of the same stocks that could offer a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo assess the ETF, it would be cumbersome to include every holding, so we have opted to consider only the top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF. Listed below are the top 10 holdings and their percentage of total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF overall, we can use the current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate each stock's contribution to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio consisted solely of these 10 stocks in the proportions set by the ETF's holdings. The calculations of Beta and return are shown in the chart below.\n\nThe chart indicates that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than that of the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. It also shows that the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole. Based on the results so far, it appears that a portfolio composed of just the top 10 holdings could yield a higher return with a lower beta. Nevertheless, there is a chance that the means of these two portfolios might not be statistically different.\n\nTo evaluate whether these portfolios differ statistically, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is calculated and normalized to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, the third month of the project saw a sharp decline in commuter log submissions, which was somewhat discouraging, and the reasons for this are not entirely clear. The arrival of winter on a New England campus likely led to fewer people commuting by bike or on foot, possibly explaining part of the downturn. December is also the end of the fall semester, a time when everyone is busy with completing assignments, grading, and other tasks, so keeping up with the commuter log might not have been a priority. Additionally, December ushers in the bustling holiday season and a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many do not need to be on campus. Classes resume in late January for the spring semester, which could also explain the low log numbers for that month. However, this doesn't clarify the low submissions in February. It might be that such projects initially generate enthusiasm that naturally wanes over time. To counteract this, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a focused campaign that did boost log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the key challenges we faced was maintaining project momentum amid a natural decline in engagement and the specific disruptions caused by holidays and semester breaks in higher education.\n\nAnother challenge of this project, or any alternative commuting initiative, is that people cherish the freedom, independence, and flexibility associated with driving their own cars, which is deeply ingrained in our culture. Therefore, offering incentives to encourage alternative commuting is crucial. We distributed numerous prizes like gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, a local bookstore, and some larger national chains. It would have been interesting to see how offering even larger prizes might have influenced participation—such as awarding a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car, which might have helped address the engagement drop. The nature of the prizes remained consistent throughout the project. However, if the value of the prizes had increased over time, it might have made a difference. The gift cards were quite effective at the beginning, but announcing in December that we were adding a couple of bicycles, and in January a hybrid or electric car, could potentially have increased participation and engagement rather than seeing a decline.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all fifteen trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films typically utilize creative editing techniques to create illusions. My analysis focused on describing the artistic elements of most trick films and identifying unique evolutionary features in some of the later ones. Generally, trick films from the turn of the century are confined to a set, framed within a frontal proscenium, with no camera movement, using long and medium shots, and following a strict one shot per film approach. However, some films from the early 1900s deviate from these norms by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne common feature of these trick films is their filming within an interior set framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, not moving to follow characters or objects. This style was prevalent in early films, drawing inspiration from theater and, specifically for trick films, from vaudeville and magic shows. A drawback of using a stage setup is that characters in trick films typically only move laterally, without approaching or retreating from the camera. For instance, in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), actors enter from the right and move horizontally. Even as they exit the frame, the camera remains static.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition also results in predominantly long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-ups are absent in Edison’s trick films, reflecting the theater and vaudeville tradition where audiences saw the complete performance within the stage's borders. In early films, actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, eliminating the need for close-ups.\n\nMost early trick films adhere to a pattern where one conceptual shot equals a film. This restricts their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used, and limits their dramatic or narrative potential. They mainly focus on brief, vaudeville-style tricks like magic and disappearing acts with minimal story. However, in a trick film, what appears as one conceptual shot to the viewer might involve multiple physical shots combined to create illusions of appearance or disappearance. For example, in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), careful observation reveals the transition point to the physical shot featuring Mary's severed \"head,\" even though the film appears as a single conceptual shot to the audience.",
            "Ian Watt refers to the classic \"Gothic Novel\" as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" in his work, The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic style has been both criticized and celebrated, accused of lacking depth, yet praised for its 'terrible sublime' quality, as noted by Burke. Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the first \"Gothic Novel,\" merged elements of both \"ancient and modern\" romances to craft the early Gothic genre, introducing a novel literary expression. Walpole combined \"old\" theatrical techniques with 'new' naturalistic elements found in 'modern' novels to present what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre incorporates many aspects reminiscent of medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and customs. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, \"gothic\" described various peoples, styles, and eras, often seen as outdated or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The blend of theatrical \"Gothic\" elements with the novel's new format, which offers a more intimate view of characters' psychology, has allowed Gothic literature to endure over time, simultaneously appearing obsolete and fresh to readers far removed from its original context.\n\nA key gothic theme in Gothic novels is Chivalry. The medieval concept of chivalry, which involved training a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry holds particular significance for Gothic authors because it symbolizes the classic knight—brave, honorable, competent—and the perceived absence of these ideals in society, as observed by writers like Walpole. By employing chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, foreshadowing the Gothic's evolution into Romanticism and serving as an attempt to better the present. When Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto, he was amidst political turmoil and concerned about the future. Immersed in politics and possibly facing unjust accusations, he may have believed, even if subconsciously, that the perceived morality and inherent \"goodness\" of people from the gothic era were missing in contemporary society. This notion is evident in several characters, including Frederic. Before meeting Frederic, the reader learns that he possesses many chivalric qualities; he is depicted as a prince who has endured suffering, been profoundly affected by tragedy, and is presumed to have been killed by infidels. The portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, naturally, exaggerated, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the series of processes involved in moving goods from a customer's order through the stages of raw material acquisition, supply, production, and distribution until they reach the customer. The concept of supply chain management was introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver. He explained the comprehensive process of planning, executing, and controlling supply chain activities to meet customer needs efficiently and promptly. The supply chain consists of six fundamental components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nProduction is the initial phase of the supply chain process and serves as the foundation for the entire operation. This stage involves determining when, why, where, and how products will be manufactured. Managers must understand customer preferences, which can be gauged by analyzing market trends. The market offers insights into customer demands, enabling managers to decide what products to produce and in what quantities. Once these decisions are made, managers then determine the best location and facility for production, considering volume and quality requirements while ensuring customer satisfaction. After selecting the production site, managers focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Effective planning is crucial, as overlooking details can lead to significant time and financial losses. For instance, my experience working at Walmart and Target highlighted the importance of having structured processes, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments, which helps streamline operations and set clear expectations.\n\nThe second crucial component in supply chain management is supply. Supply involves making strategic decisions that define a facility's core capabilities and determine the growth of outsourcing partnerships. A company might have various production divisions for a single product, each with unique equipment, personnel, and expertise. Managers must choose the most suitable division for each stage of the production process. Sometimes, outsourcing to other companies is considered to enhance efficiency. The primary motivation for outsourcing is to achieve velocity, which is the ability to deliver quality and flexibility while minimizing or maintaining low costs.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous detail and focus on the aristocracy of the era. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, while considered Victorian, deviate from this norm. These novels incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, which are not typical of the time, to enhance their characters by offering deeper insights into their motivations and emotions.\n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels often utilize mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike experiences, although the content and purpose differ in each case. In Oliver Twist, such strange occurrences often reveal insights into Oliver’s inner struggles, his suffering, and his understanding of the reality around him. When the incident of Oliver being shot is revisited in chapter 28, he relives it vividly, almost like a dream, while he seeks assistance. This passage highlights the lack of control Oliver had over the events, as well as the severity of his health condition, reflected in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing his senses so much that he is unaware of the “unseen hand” that carries him away; he relives his despair, detached from the initial shock of pain, as it has become constant and associated with fear rather than surprise. Oliver’s overwhelming experience raises the question of whose will led to his misfortune, as it certainly wasn’t his own. This incident reinforces the idea that Oliver has little control over anything, unable to even attempt to influence the outcome of events, even when his life is at stake. This selection suggests a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if old Fagin has begun to break him, compelling him to accept his despair and affecting his ability to respond. Otherwise, it is implied that Oliver would have made some effort to save himself.\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.",
            "A few years back, I worked in an after-school program where I tutored elementary students. I tried to assist them with any subject they found difficult, although my expertise was in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to help a young boy named Adrian, who was in either third or fourth grade and was struggling with reading. I noticed something unusual; while he could pronounce some letters perfectly, others were a complete mystery to him. It was quite odd. Adrian, who was of Latino heritage, spoke flawless English, which puzzled me. We continued to face challenges until I met his mother. I was watching over a few students who stayed behind while the rest of the group went on a field trip when she arrived. Adrian's mother spoke only Spanish, not a word of English. Despite my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate. It suddenly became clear to me: Adrian could read well but didn't know the English alphabet very thoroughly. I'm not sure if this realization helped him significantly, but I hope he's doing better now. \n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issue in schools, particularly in California. It also illustrates that the problem isn't always apparent. Even a child who speaks perfect English can find reading it a formidable challenge. We can all agree that this issue exists, but what can be done? In Adrian's case, the answer was relatively straightforward: tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children who barely speak English, the solution is more complicated. There's no single answer. The key is in combining various approaches like the dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes. \n\nThe dual language system is an excellent concept, not just for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Research shows that children in bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Some fear that it's a waste of resources and won't benefit most students, but that's not true. If we made such programs the norm rather than the exception, all children would gain from them. How should we implement this? Should we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that would be impractical. However, there's no reason we can't have special aides or tutors who are bilingual.",
            "From a young age, many of us are taught that there exists something larger and more incomprehensible than ourselves. Some attend Sunday school to learn about it, others go to Temple, or seek answers within themselves. Many accept the religious beliefs passed down by their parents, while some reject these beliefs, insisting that nothing exists beyond their personal, self-centered world. We might adopt one belief system only to later replace it with another. Regardless of the path we take, we strive to define ourselves through our individual views on spirituality, searching for guidance to lead us from darkness to light.\n\n\"My favorite bird is a cardinal,\" my father replied when I asked him. We were sitting on our front porch, listening to the rain drumming on the tin roof, sharing a cigarette. The gutters poured water, drowning the plants lining the porch. He gazed into the rain, his look a mix of searching and reminiscing. Over the past months, he had lost weight, and his clothes hung loosely on him. His hair had thinned too, more than I remembered. He kept looking at the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt isolated, scared, unable to express how much I would miss him, as speaking about it would make it all too real. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer to his, and joined him in watching the rain fall in the June twilight.\n\nMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation did not alleviate his suffering but extended his life a few months beyond the doctors' expectations; I couldn't understand the value in prolonging his suffering. What kind of God would allow this, I wondered. Alone at night, I didn't pray; I felt that if God existed, he had long since stopped listening to me.\n\nI didn't want to witness his transition from this life to the next, so I didn't. I couldn't bear to watch the life that brought me into the world as it ended. I wanted to remember my father for how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew him better than anyone else, and I was certain he wouldn't want his only child to witness his death. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an enthusiastic early supporter of Republicanism. Despite being mainly an agriculturist, his profession and brief political career made him known for his commitment and vocal stance on personal freedom and governance. His belief in an agrarian system shaped nearly all his views on government. He sought to uphold and promote what he saw as the most noble profession, influencing his thoughts on sovereignty, constitutional matters, and the judiciary.\n\nTaylor saw that the United States had a unique chance to develop an ideal system since there were no entrenched traditions to constrain the founders, enabling them to create a system of self-governance. He was a strong advocate for natural rights, viewing them as interconnected—if one is denied, they all become compromised, reducing their significance. Thus, these rights should be out of government’s reach. He argued that the so-called \"state of nature\" allowed those with physical strength and cunning to thrive, but civilization should not follow this pattern.\n\nFor Taylor, building this ideal society required a government that acknowledged both the good and evil in people. He held a firm belief in dualistic morality, stating, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). Good principles, he claimed, were those that protected private property, enhanced agriculture, and resisted capitalism. A government grounded in these principles would operate justly regardless of its leadership, which would inevitably be driven by greed and self-interest. He saw self-interest as a universal human motivator but considered it negative only when it led to factions that thrived at others’ expense. A good government was essential to curb humanity’s inherent evil, and even then, it required vigilant oversight to prevent the adoption of harmful principles.\n\nLike many firm Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a highly restricted Federal government, limited to the powers explicitly granted by the Constitution. A large Federal government, he believed, was costly and prone to tyranny. However, he thought a simplistic literal reading was risky, potentially corrupt without considering the framers’ intentions. He regarded the Declaration of Independence as the true foundation of the United States, as it more clearly defined the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "I stared down, my mind blankly absorbing the scene before me. Without emotion or sound, I observed with a practiced eye, one that analyzed without connecting the subject to any abstract ideas. Thoughts flickered in and out of my mind so quickly it felt as if I had no real thoughts of my own, only a fluid experience of what I saw. Once, following advice from an artist I knew, I bought an art instruction book titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had wanted to learn to draw since I was six, and this book taught everything from the basics of a pencil to how the brain processes lines. One technique it suggested was to use a square frame to focus on any picture the artist wanted to study. This way, a complex scene, like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen opening to a dining room, could be simplified to just the bowl of fruit on a plain surface. At the time, as I looked down at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't imagine framing it like an artist. I was too overwhelmed, too amazed, that I could only stand there in awe. Picasso had his blue period, Monet loved greenery, and the Italian Renaissance masters used a spectrum of colors. If I dared to consider my perspective as artistic, this was the start of my picture, my story, Work in Brown. My fingers touched my chosen tool, muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand moved, my mind's intention taking form in what could have been my most creative moment. Water swirled, serene and clear. Bits of matter broke away and disappeared. Muscles tightened, my hand striking the toilet handle again with more urgency. The unpleasant brown mass wouldn't budge, stuck to the bottom like a slug. Holding the mop loosely, feet a foot apart, and a green tie uncomfortably snug around my neck, I frowned at the unpleasant heap of processed matter left as a message for those who cleaned the Rite Aid bathrooms. After a few more flushes and quiet, reflective moments, my hand reached for the toilet paper, wrapped around until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing straight, then bending at the waist, my hand lowered into the bowl like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "Teenagers are losing their lives in car accidents. Several factors contribute to this alarming trend among the youngest drivers in America. According to the National Institutes of Health, one issue is that the adolescent brain is not yet equipped to handle the dangers of driving. Inexperience is also a key factor, leading not only to more fatal crashes but also to an increased prevalence of vehicle rollovers, speeding incidents, and cars veering off the road. Teen drivers are particularly at risk when traveling with friends, a common occurrence as anyone with common sense might expect. Research by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a link between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents. \n\nTo enhance teen driver safety, California and other states have implemented temporary provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and ban other minors as passengers. However, I see these provisional licenses as temporary solutions. The fundamental problem is that, statistically, the youngest drivers are not yet capable of managing the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 may be too young for a standard driver's license. USA Today highlights Zuckerman's research, which shows that individuals under 19-20 often engage in risky behavior for excitement. Delaying driving until this thrill-seeking tendency diminishes seems logical. Continuing to issue licenses to young teens will likely result in more fatal accidents, with the death toll potentially soaring in the coming years. By 2010, the children of Baby Boomers will reach driving age, adding millions of new teen drivers to the roads.\n\nAddressing this issue through legislation would be relatively straightforward. Schools could still provide driver's education to prepare future drivers, but individuals under 18 would not be allowed to drive. A provisional permit could be granted before a full driver's license, with a requirement for a specific number of practical driving hours. This number could align with the current requirements in most states (such as California's requirement of six hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult). Since the troubling statistics for teen drivers are consistent across all states, a unified national law would be a sensible and effective approach to safeguarding teens nationwide. The legislation I propose is not entirely new.",
            "This paper explores three facets of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, it offers a concise definition of the disorder. It then discusses the diagnosis process, highlighting typical traits or \"red flags.\" Lastly, it suggests methods a teacher in a mainstream classroom can use to support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is concerned with how effectively and efficiently the central nervous system (CNS) uses auditory information. In a more specific sense, (C)AP involves the perceptual processing of auditory data within the CNS and the neurobiological activity that supports this processing, leading to electrophysiologic auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it is a disorder where the brain struggles to properly process auditory information. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally and are not classified as \"hearing impaired\"; instead, the brain region responsible for interpreting sounds, distinguishing words, or separating conversation from background noise does not operate as expected.\n\nThe concept that eventually became CAPD was first mentioned in the mid-1950s as “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), when researchers were examining children with communication disorders. An Italian research team led by Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started developing tests for these children in 1954, and in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and created a model to explain the central auditory nervous system's physiology relevant to dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 spurred further research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD can present in various ways: affected individuals might struggle to locate or hear sound spatially, differentiate between multiple sound occurrences, recognize sound patterns, detect changes in speech tone (like sarcasm), have one sound blocked by another, lack the ability to interpret sound cues meaningfully, and be unable to discern the sequence in which auditory information is delivered (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,\" performed by audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and other professionals using diverse measures to assess auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires, surveys, and observing auditory responses to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single tool or test that consistently achieves a high diagnostic success rate, and the disorder has no known cause. Many tests challenge the patient with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli, requiring them to differentiate items like a sequence of words or numbers. More advanced tests might involve recording acoustic signals in the ear and measuring responses to these signals.",
            "In my pursuit of a social work education, I aim to establish a career with the Division of Family and Children Services to support children who have faced abuse or neglect and to assist families in distress. The values I bring to the social work profession include service, respect, ethics, dedication to enhancing interpersonal relationships, and a commitment to my professional development to ensure my competence. These values are crucial not only to social workers but also to me personally.\n\nI have always had a desire to help others, although I was uncertain about which career path to take. During my high school and college years, I observed many people avoiding their problems or using poor coping strategies. Witnessing these situations led me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of my career direction, I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy at her home. She explained that he was there to escape his abusive parents. The following day, I found out he had contacted the police about his parents. I went to his parents’ house to see if I could assist. I privately expressed my concerns to the police and mentioned my recent Psychology degree. The police asked me to speak with the parents since the law couldn't intervene for the teenager. When I talked to the parents, they appeared uneasy and gave excuses about their son’s “manipulative” behavior in involving outsiders for \"simple\" family issues. This experience prompted me to seriously consider a career in social work to aid children with family “disputes.”\n\nAnother essential value in social work is social justice. While society claims to value individuals and mourns those we've lost, the societal concept of the “individual” is more about adhering to outdated traditions than embracing uniqueness. If we mourn lost individuals, why do we strive to conform to be like \"everyone else?\" I see myself as an individual and refuse to limit myself to conform. During my high school and college years, I consistently opposed social injustice: by dyeing my hair in unconventional colors, wearing clothes that expressed my personality, getting multiple ear piercings, joining the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and actively fighting against racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. I believe in social justice and will continue to oppose social injustice.",
            "This paper explores the Biological and Sociocultural models concerning the disorder of insomnia. The biological model emphasizes genetic inheritance and medical health aspects, while the Sociocultural models consider environmental interactions and their relevance to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The review of insomnia presented here examines these models, discussing each chosen research piece to enhance the understanding of the models. The research findings are critiqued, highlighting their particular strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder may be classified as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder linked to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder associated with other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, whereas sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are connected to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorders might result from medical issues or substance use. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in achieving or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is characterized by trouble staying awake, both persisting for at least one month. Narcolepsy is associated with cataplexy and/or automatic REM. Dyssomnias are concerned with initiating and maintaining sleep, whereas Parasomnias involve sleep disorders linked to abnormal behaviors or physiological events. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to other mental disorders involve sleep issues due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily focuses on insomnia and, to some extent, on primary sleep disorders in general, as they relate to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders examines genetic, heritable factors, and physiological aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study using mice found phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons specifically responsible for sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while its inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that animal models in mice can be applied to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence of this receptor could affect one's ability to sleep adequately without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if this phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and any alteration in the receptor could naturally disrupt an individual's sleep. This would negatively impact life aspects such as education, career, and daily activities requiring monotony and focus.",
            "I have been studying at University Park for roughly two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many, including myself. During my freshman year, I lived in a dorm in East Halls, which is nearly the farthest eastern point of campus, apart from the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes, especially in the often poor weather of State College. An alumnus, not much older than me, informed me that not long ago, East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the campus by large areas of unused land. Now, that space is occupied by sports fields, large new buildings like the Creamery and health services building, and surrounded by apartments. As our campus keeps growing, moving from one place to another becomes increasingly difficult. What is the best way to address mobility issues? On a college campus, bicycles are the answer. However, bikes alone aren't enough; students need to use them, and the campus should be designed to accommodate bicyclists' needs.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who started biking again after a break of several years. He remarked that he wondered why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are fantastic,\" he said. \"For a while, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only practical way to get around.\" Besides being beneficial for your health, biking is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off-campus, just as distant from the center as some dorms. The best decision I made this year was purchasing a bike. I have classes in the Thomas building every day, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. Cycling can reduce that time to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. The only issue is that Pollock Road, the most direct route to the Thomas building from my house, isn't always easy to navigate, whether on a bike or not. Walking has its advantages too, but I don't have the time to walk. Without my bike, walking would be my only dependable way to get to class, which would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily routine. That's more than two and a half hours each week, plus additional time spent walking to other classes and appointments. I simply can't afford that much time.",
            "In \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley critiques the looming dangers of technology and capitalism, which support a dystopian society. The novel's society prioritizes community over individuality, with citizens conditioned from birth to seek immediate happiness. These individuals are merely pieces in a larger scheme, restricted to a single ideology controlled by the World Controller. Viewed through a Marxist lens, the book reveals Huxley's skepticism about these systems. Marxist terms like homogeny and reification highlight the novel as a critique of the economic developments of Huxley's era.\n\nCapitalism is lampooned using the Marxist concept of false consciousness, which suggests that ordinary people are unaware of their true economic class relations, focusing instead on personal gain. This results from ideological control over the working class, as depicted by the conditioning in \"Brave New World.\" The lower classes, such as Delta and Gamma, lack genuine autonomy; hypnopædia intensifies their urge to consume and indulge above all else, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, where social classes are entirely dominated by another group, is evident here. The lower classes remain oblivious to their manipulation, essentially buying into an ideology that supports capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes might recognize this manipulation but typically do nothing, with few exceptions like Bernard. The interactions among social classes provide significant insight into the perceived oppression by capitalism.\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" true relationships between individuals are non-existent. The characters, even the main ones, lack depth, suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism robs people of free will and self-expression. Love and strong emotions are absent; interactions are shallow, as shown by men's comments on women's physical traits and women's candid discussions of their encounters. Additionally, each class's satisfaction with its social status reflects capitalism's socioeconomic impact. Their complete obedience within the community aligns with Marxist views on the proletariat, who are misled into believing in their superiority as long as they continue to consume, conform, and align with their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. One of the primary subjects of intense discussion was whether Islam is a hostile religion. I feel this question is more pertinent today than ever. Reflecting on events since 9/11, I have noticed the media's shift from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to a more extreme tolerance for Islam in America. Back in 2001, it would have been unimaginable for a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, whose family has a clear Muslim background, to emerge.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet fascinates me because, based on my knowledge of Muhammad's history, it seems to contradict his personality. Previously, I believed that Muhammad compelled conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and imposing the religion on them. However, the biography portrays Muhammad as a misunderstood martyr who humbled himself before others, leading people to gradually see the 'truth' in his teachings and seek him out.\n\nAdditionally, there are striking parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad. A notable example is when Muhammad multiplied mutton and milk to abundantly feed forty men. This style of writing suggests the authors aimed to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who lived in truth and miracles without needing validation. I find this problematic as it undermines the miracles and life of Jesus Christ, seemingly appropriating Jesus's legacy through Muhammad.\n\nThe biography also includes numerous stories suggesting an agenda to demonstrate 'witness' or show how people independently converted to Islam. The issue is that many stories are relayed from a third-party perspective, with the author narrating tales heard from others. This approach, intended to verify the truth of these stories, instead makes them appear more dubious to me.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a divine man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. However, history challenges the notion of Muhammad as a gentle and humble figure, and I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true historical context of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus during his lifetime were quickly set aside as Christian thought evolved after his death. Observing this history broadly, we notice a pattern of Christianity drifting further from its roots. In today's world, there is an increasing awareness and a strong progressive tendency. While there are still traditionalists who resist any new ideas beyond what they were taught, this group may not be influential enough to sway the entire population. Among Christians, historical awareness is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. There will be a widespread desire to differentiate the doctrines added to Christianity over time from the original intentions of its founder. This process may take decades or even centuries, but it seems inevitable: there will be a significant reversal in Christian history, moving back to its original form. A movement will arise, gradually peeling away layers of doctrine, as if turning back the clock, until only the original teachings of Jesus remain, before other thinkers contributed their interpretations. When this shift occurs in the United States and Europe, influencing many to worship as if they were living in Jesus' time and following only his teachings, the institutional church will remain strong to guide this change. However, as the theological clock rewinds, the current diversity in Christianity will give way to increasing uniformity in belief and practice. Instead of differences between regions, denominations, and divisions, there will be growing similarities. Human history is full of major reversions. For instance, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, which later became a Christian institution. Our country has transitioned from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The forthcoming major reversion will unfold within Christianity, reversing history to find its origins and reducing diversity in the process. A key aspect of this transformation will be interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically, not literally. So, what has happened since Jesus' time? Looking far back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological foundation of Christianity. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion. The Jewish community was not unified, dividing into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I think The Jungle illustrates how humans are inherently greedy and self-centered, primarily concerned with improving their own lives without caring for those beneath them. The novel highlights this through various examples, most notably the factory owners and managers who focus solely on expanding their businesses. They disregard anyone or anything that might suffer due to their progress. Upton Sinclair's narrative emphasizes the environmental damage caused by these factories, describing the buildings' silhouettes and the smoke spreading far and wide. Sinclair portrays the owners as indifferent to the harm caused to people and animals by pollution and waste from the stockyards.\n\nAdditionally, the owners and managers show no concern for the workers who generate their wealth. They prioritize profit over loyalty or decency, fostering a toxic atmosphere of jealousy and hatred. Workers endure long hours and face sudden layoffs without notice or support. During the time The Jungle is set, there were few, if any, laws safeguarding workers' rights, enabling managers to exploit employees by accelerating production and maintaining poor working conditions. Though the novel doesn't state it outright, those working in Packingtown were expected to endure these harsh conditions both at work and at home. There were no organizations to assist them, and unions often exploited them further. The workers, trapped in this oppressive system, were likened to slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is considered by Edgar Allan Poe to be among his finer poems. In this work, he uses the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which scholar Mabbott connects back to Virgil. Virgil referenced an island north of Britain, thought by the Greeks to be the world's edge, using this term. Although Virgil's usage is certain, there is a more contemporary influence that merits acknowledgment. Poe was notably interested in German writers. This detail highlights Poe's familiarity with Goethe's works. In his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" Karl J. Arndt discusses the likeness between their poems, suggesting Poe was emulating Goethe.\n\nAccording to the Oxford Companion to English Literature, Goethe was a renowned author of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Within the second part of \"Faust\" is a brief poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells of a king who, after his wife's death, drinks excessively and mourns her memory. Eventually, he decides to die, bequeathing his belongings to his children, except for a goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and dies. The king's demeanor in \"The King of Thulé\" mirrors the description of the king in \"Dream-Land,\" possibly reflecting Poe's own losses and struggles with alcohol. \"Faust\" was also adapted into a romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, just before Poe used the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe mentions Thule twice in his collected works. He references \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and uses this phrase twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as complementary pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes Thule as a dark, lonely place, haunted by the memory of deceased friends, and devoid of color. These elements echo \"The King of Thulé,\" where the king mourns his wife and loses his will to rule or live. The poem's imagery suggests the speaker has entered Goethe's narrative.\n\nGoethe was a significant literary figure whom Poe would have known, if only through his admiration for Tennyson. Poe, when asked about his opinion of Tennyson, acknowledged this connection. Beyond the Tennyson link, Poe would have encountered Goethe’s work through its many reproductions post-publication.",
            "Under California law, a customer injured from slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store might be entitled to punitive damages if it can be shown that the store manager acted with malice. This could be argued if the manager was twice informed about the spill and failed to clean it for half an hour because he was having dinner. It is unlikely that a judge would quickly dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive damages. To justify such a claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant acted with willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm their actions would cause, and that the behavior was egregious. Palmer could argue that Martin should have been aware of the potential harm of not addressing the spill, especially since multiple previous incidents of slipping had occurred at D&D in the months leading up to Palmer’s accident. Despite this awareness, Martin failed to clean the spill. Although Palmer’s argument that Martin’s conduct was egregious is less compelling, it remains reasonable considering that six slip-and-fall incidents were reported in 2009, yet Martin did not take adequate measures to ensure the store’s safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin replied that he was on his dinner break and couldn’t address customer complaints at that time. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin of the spill, and he gave the same response. At 5:30 pm on that day, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped on the spill and suffered a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident, five slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for both compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and there is consideration of filing a motion for partial summary judgment against the claim for punitive damages.\n\nIn California, punitive damages can be awarded for a breach of obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud, or malice” as per Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The law defines malice as actions intended to cause harm, or if not intentional, then “despicable” actions carried out with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have deemed conduct malicious when it is done with conscious disregard for the plaintiff’s rights, where the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "She had always felt an unfulfilled longing. This yearning began when she was around 14, as she entered her teenage years, and persisted at 17. By then, she realized she sought a person rather than a thing, yet had no interest in the boys around her. Some boys showed interest in her and awkwardly tried to win her over, but none caught her attention. She often questioned this peculiar feeling, pondering what could cause such an unusual situation for a teenage girl. Years of reflection brought theories, but none substantial enough to satisfy her curiosity. Thus, she continued living, perpetually questioning her desires.\n\nA typical day at home was peaceful. Her parents were calm and kind, rarely arguing with each other or with her. The only disputes arose when their daughter asserted her independence and free spirit. Despite being the child of a serene couple, she contrasted their energy with her vibrant personality, making her well-liked.\n\nHowever, today was not a calm day. As she moved through the house seeking inspiration, she heard a brief scream from the kitchen, her mother's beautiful voice. She rushed in, panicking, and asked, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the floor, in pain, repeatedly saying \"Ow\" with short breaths. The daughter hurried to her side, trying to help. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital,\" her mother said, the words strained and hurried, revealing her agony. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up,\" she responded. Her mother gestured, and at that moment, the daughter felt grateful for the strength training she had undergone. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the backseat, and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was filled with the smell of disinfectant, sickness, and a hint of fear. However, her focus was solely on helping her mother. She quickly carried her mother inside and called for medical assistance. Several concerned faces appeared, and someone brought a rolling bed, laying her mother on it and taking her for immediate examination, leaving the daughter to wait anxiously.\n\nHer mother had fallen off a stepping stool while trying to reach a vase from the highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", correlates with a decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke-related deaths. The aMed diet is a modified version of the traditional Med diet, emphasizing a higher intake of plant-based foods, such as plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (as opposed to saturated fats), and fish, while reducing the consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown an inverse relationship between following a Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial also found the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in obese individuals. However, earlier studies did not specifically examine stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological research tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who had no history of CVD or diabetes and were part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) intended to assess nutrient intake over the past year. Over 95% of the nurses remained involved throughout the 20-year span. The FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were deemed \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions classified this way. For each FFQ, body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated, and leisure-time physical activity was assessed starting in 1986.\n\nTo minimize random variation for an individual and better reflect long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were computed (averaging scores from the previous two years). Adjustments for potential confounders, such as age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use, were made.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the association between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a reduced risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up, there were 2,391 new cases of CHD, 1,763 new cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (including fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the top quintile of aMed scores had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.71.",
            "The sign reads, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" \n\nEllen Page, known for her role in Juno, stands by herself on a street corner, holding a cardboard sign overhead with this disturbing message written in Sharpie. Burma, also referred to as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a brutal military junta that seized power in a 1962 coup. In 2007, the country witnessed its first public demonstrations in a decade, led primarily by Buddhist monks. These protests, dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution\" due to the color of the monks' robes, initially attracted broader public support. Although the government initially tolerated the monks' peaceful assemblies, the situation quickly escalated into what many viewed as a full-scale conflict between the monks and the military regime, with the military launching raids on monasteries nationwide. Foreign journalists were arrested immediately, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed on September 27th, 2007, for attending a street protest. While official reports claim 13 deaths, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army shortly before the official announcement, reported that the actual number of deaths was in the thousands.\n\nThese events are not unique. While they are recent examples of global atrocities, the suppression of dissent and the pursuit of absolute control by governments have been present throughout history. Early Roman emperors claimed divine selection for their absolute rule, while Japanese emperors were considered deities, believed to guide their people to success through innovations like Motorola phones and ritual suicide. Similarly, President George W. Bush reportedly held weekly calls with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, linked to the Republican Party.\n\nNotable historical examples include the June 4th, 1989, protests in Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students protested against government authoritarianism. The death toll estimates vary significantly, from the Chinese government's report of 200-300 deaths to the Chinese Red Cross's claim of 2,000-3,000 deaths. Another instance is the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s, where Hutu militias, with government support, systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of ethnicity. Hitler’s Third Reich, during which Jews were systematically persecuted and exterminated across several countries, stands as another extreme example.",
            "Duke Ellington's significant contribution to jazz largely stems from his long career and his exceptional skill in shaping his orchestra. While his piano presence is understated in many compositions chosen for this task, Ellington's brilliance as a composer lies in his ability to create intricate and multifaceted pieces that highlighted the unique talents of his band members. He devised a structure within which soloists could improvise freely, while also crafting carefully orchestrated segments tailored to the distinct styles of his musicians to bring out specific musical ideas. Through this, he emphasized the overall tone of the orchestra, producing cohesive and original sounds for each piece. Ellington's deep understanding of each player's sound, along with their integration into a larger ensemble, allowed him to compose some of jazz's most groundbreaking and remarkable works.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes Ellington's innovative sound, citing \"Creole Love Call\" as an early example of his use of the voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This piece demonstrates how Ellington used voice to add texture and richness, without relying on lyrics, and showcases his skill in complementing his soloists' styles, a hallmark throughout his career. The slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece features six choruses:\n\n- Chorus 1: A call and response between voice and reeds, starting smoothly and melodically, then shifting to a harsher tone.\n- Chorus 2: A muted trumpet solo elaborates on the melody, emphasizing extended blue notes.\n- Chorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, with a subtle syncopated piano backdrop.\n- Chorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response between brass and reeds.\n- Chorus 5: The climactic chorus, with reeds initiating the call and response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop-time from brass and rhythm sections.\n- Chorus 6: Returns to the structure of the first chorus, featuring a call and response between voice and reeds, with the voice using the \"growl\" technique, soloing like an instrument.\n- Tag: A brief vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add tonal color to this piece is a stylistic feature that is evident throughout his body of work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington combines his expertise in tight orchestration with his sensitivity to tone color. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing blends Miley's vocal trumpet style with Cox's instrumental-sounding voice, creating a rich and complementary sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" expands on these concepts, with Ellington effectively employing Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a key figure in Ellington's orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "What drives the specific path of evolutionary change in organisms? Are there particular limitations that steer the course of evolution? As early as 1917, D’Arcy Thompson remarked that even the simplest organic forms were challenging to express in mathematical terms—a sentiment that remains relevant today. However, the application of mathematical modeling to general aspects of mollusk shell formation, considering both their development and evolutionary history, has been explored by researchers like Raup and Stanley in 1981. Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of changes in Prunum, alongside experimental studies, can clarify the mechanisms determining the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental changes. We employed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to define quantitative parameters for modeling both theoretical and actual shell shapes. These parameters were input into the software CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We created models of hypothetical shell forms to interpret the potential limits of morphological changes in Prunum. These findings are integrated with experimental and descriptive research to enhance the understanding of large-scale evolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be conceptualized as a tube that progresses through time, rotating 360 degrees in space. These rotations of a coiled shell are known as whorls, spiraling around an imaginary central axis called the columella, which runs through the shell's center. The rate at which the whorls expand can vary, with a continuous line, the suture, marking the separation between each whorl. Typically, the largest whorl is the final one, known as the body whorl. All whorls except the last make up the spire, with the apex at the spire's tip and the base at the opposite end. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The standard orientation is the apertural view, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex pointing upward.\n\nThe following is a method for counting whorls. Begin by viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identify where the first suture starts. A line is then drawn to divide the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be considered as a sequence of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be tracked using the coordinates of each whorl’s aperture center, along with the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis path can be depicted graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical model is established, it allows for the adjustment of parameters and modification of the mollusk’s shell formation process.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have shown little change. Although the country is progressing towards achieving several Millennium Development Goals, including those related to water and sanitation, the advancements in child and maternal health fall significantly short of the targets set for 2015. The reasons for this shortfall will be explored further, suggesting the need for a stronger health system rather than solely program-focused interventions.\n\nImprovements have been made in the number of births attended by skilled health workers, with 72% now meeting this standard. However, this figure includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who may not be equipped to handle complex medical situations, leading to a high rate of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. Thus, while progress in this area appears positive, it is somewhat deceptive, indicating much more work remains. Additionally, there has been a reduction in the proportion of children under five with diarrhea receiving professional medical treatment. Incomplete data on postnatal care highlights another area of concern, as rates remain low nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates are lower than expected, at about 4%. This statistic reveals another troubling issue; while urban areas have a c-section rate of 7%, rural areas have only 2%, highlighting a disparity in healthcare access across the country. Access to healthcare is concentrated in urban zones, and vertical equity is also a challenge. A 27% difference in service use exists between the poorest and wealthiest groups, indicating that the poor face greater challenges accessing healthcare, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn considering future steps to improve neonatal and maternal health indicators, the fundamental question is how best to address the service gaps. Should Indonesia focus on specific programs or enhance the overall health system, without prioritizing pre- and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children? Programmatic approaches are appealing because they offer specific, manageable goals and often deliver quicker outcomes. However, there are notable drawbacks. A significant issue is that focusing resources on one area can divert funding from others, drawing human resources to areas with more funding, as seen with international HIV/AIDS funding impacting the family planning sector. Additionally, having multiple parallel programs for the same area can lead to service duplication and lack of coordination, increasing paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "Over the past century, the categorization of Popular Music has expanded so extensively that it's challenging to enumerate all the genres definitively. Adding to the complexity, nearly every genre—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—has given rise to numerous sub-genres and even further subdivisions. Among these, the Heavy Metal rock sub-genre has arguably emerged as one of the most varied and expressive in popular music over the last 40 years. Its expressiveness is due to its wide emotional range, often skewing toward darker themes. Its diversity stems from the genre's inherent flexibility, recognized early on, which allowed people to create their own sub-genres, followed by further subdivisions, a trend that continues today.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal scene has evolved to encompass so many niche groups that defining heavy metal precisely is challenging. While it now incorporates many elements from other genres, like all music, it originated from a specific point. To truly understand the metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp what the metal movement represents and why it's considered a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nIn many respects, metal is a movement characterized by darkness. It can be described as \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more aggression, more drama. It involves less primitiveness and more technical skill, with band members demonstrating considerable proficiency with their instruments. Metal is also, unsurprisingly, a movement deeply influenced by drug use. The psychedelic drug surge in the mid-70s prompted people to create wild, otherworldly records, using drugs as a catalyst for their creativity. Metal contains many dark, intense qualities, which was quite novel for the music scene, as much of popular music lacked such dark emotional depth. Additionally, later metal generations drew inspiration from the dark, intense qualities prevalent during the Romantic Era. Lyrics like those from \"Helter Skelter\" illustrate the darkness essential to the movement:\n\nThese lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" reveal the darker aspect of the Beatles, reflecting the highs and lows often associated with drug influence. This song is considered by some to be among the earliest Heavy Metal songs. It was crafted as a response to a Rolling Stones track, which also leaned towards a heavier, darker tone. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate that they could match the Stones' heaviness, leading them to include this song on The White Album.",
            "Several decades before the Surrealist artists began creating their dreamlike artworks, Henri Rousseau was meticulously crafting his personal dreams, both in a literal and figurative sense. \"The Dream,\" a painting completed in 1910 by the renowned Post-Impressionist artist, not only depicts a woman amazed by the wonders of a dreamland but also embodies Rousseau's own aspirations and ambitions as a painter. From the start of his artistic journey, he longed for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, facing a challenging internal struggle to achieve this dream. \"The Dream\" is the piece that most accurately mirrors Rousseau's enduring internal conflict: whether to conform to or imitate specific art styles to gain acceptance in the critical art world he cherished or to maintain his creative independence and uniqueness, forging his own path.\n\nTo fully understand \"The Dream\" from this viewpoint, one must first have some knowledge of Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France, Henri Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed middle-class prosperity (Shattuck 47). He had no formal art education during his upbringing; instead, he worked for the French municipal toll service, known as a gabelou, until the age of forty, though he mistakenly earned the nickname douanier, or customs inspector (Shattuck 46). After the death of his first wife, Clémence, and the loss of eight infant children, Rousseau was left with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and deep sorrow (Shattuck 49). Seeking solace in a new life, he turned to painting for comfort and a fresh start. Unlike his contemporaries who often romanticized the peasant in their works, Rousseau was essentially a folk artist, embodying the hopes and dreams of the average person from his social class.\n\nRousseau's obsession with gaining acceptance in the art world is somewhat understandable when considered in context: as mentioned, he was not formally trained in painting and began his career much later in life, competing with many talented and more renowned modern artists. Despite years of work, Rousseau only began to receive the recognition he sought around the same time that Matisse was establishing his reputation. In \"Modern French Painters,\" author Jan Gordon notes that while Rousseau and Matisse were technically competitors, they differed not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations for painting: \"Matisse was a painter who feared producing clichéd works, whereas Rousseau aimed to create art so conventional that it would earn him entry into the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "Numerous great thinkers have suggested that there is a deep link between ethics and aesthetics, and between truth and beauty. I believe there is a fundamental reason for this. John Keats expresses this idea in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" when he writes, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our knowledge comes from education or experience, but as Keats implies, we seem to understand ethics and aesthetics without formal teaching. Both fields aim to describe rather than prescribe. Our exploration of morality and beauty largely involves explaining why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than providing rules for creating good art or moral behavior. Critiques of art or morals can never fully capture what makes something good or beautiful. For instance, discussions about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa often focus on aspects like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't fully explain why it is considered good art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often say, \"There's just something about it,\" before giving a more detailed explanation. I believe that both art and morals cannot be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor notes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe the features of a literary work, there remains something transcendent. I think ethics shares this quality. Wittgenstein says, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that this \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, is the most powerful attribute of art and morality, and that the transcendental nature of both provides a link between them. I believe that morality and art are closely connected because we experience them most profoundly at a noumenal level, a Kantian term meaning they affect us in a way that can be felt but not fully explained. This connection is even stronger in the art of literature. As McKean states, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. Moral standards may not apply to other arts, like music, but they are as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Modern Germany is recognized as a formidable and unified nation, characterized by a diverse culture stretching from the shadows of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This cultural richness is evident from Cologne on the Rhine, through the heart of Germany, to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. With such a distinct culture, it is understandable that contemporary Germany has roots in various tribes and sources.\n\nGermania is the ancestral homeland of the Germans, and the origin of its name is a topic of debate among scholars and historians. Tacitus suggested that the name derived from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were referred to as Germans before crossing the Rhine to fight the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first mentioned the term \"Germanus\" in his account of the Gallic Wars, where he described his conquests over the Gauls and battles with Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine with dubious intentions. He adopted this term from the Gauls themselves to differentiate between the conquered Gauls and the unconquered tribes. Although the precise origin remains uncertain, some speculate it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish tongue. In the opening chapter of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar wrote: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others suggest the name might have originated from the spear used in warfare, called a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or possibly from the Old Irish word garim, meaning \"to shout,\" implying the Germans were loud or boisterous. (Names of Germany)\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work “De Origine et situ Germanorum,” documented the origins of the Germans, noting that he viewed them as indigenous, unmixed with other races through migration or interaction. He argued that in earlier times, migrations occurred by sea rather than land, leading him to question why anyone would leave Asia or Africa for Germany, with its harsh climate and severe demeanor, unless it was their homeland. (Tacitus, 98)\n\nWhy would anyone leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, at least not yet. They would launch expeditions into Germania for goods and occasionally conduct land campaigns, but they predominantly returned to their vast empire. As Germanic tribes emerged in the mid-first century, they lived along the Roman Empire's borders, trading resources and serving in the Roman army ranks. (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "The play Twelfth Night suggests that while disguises can effectively enable prolonged deception, ultimately, one must abandon these false identities or risk losing their true self. A significant challenge in ending such deceit is the potential for alienation. Thus, a person must choose between preserving their own identity or maintaining relationships with others. Some individuals may react indifferently to being deceived, but others may be deeply offended by the masquerade.\n\nThe theme of deception through gender role reversal is particularly complex, raising questions about why someone might feel compelled to adopt a disguise of the opposite gender. In Viola’s situation, her disguise serves as a means of protection: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Upon arriving in a foreign land, Viola disguises herself as a man to safeguard herself from potential threats. While her plan is successful, it also isolates her from the women around her, severing an important support network. Compounding the issue, her male disguise is so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, Viola grapples with unspoken romantic tensions with Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo a modern audience, Twelfth Night might be viewed as showing how deception can reveal hidden emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain parts of the play suggest that these characters might have latent desires that are brought to the surface by Viola/Cesario’s presence. For example, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because she believes Cesario is a man, or does she secretly have feelings for women? It seems unlikely, as Shakespeare’s Olivia appears to mock people of his era who judge others based solely on appearance. This is demonstrated by how easily Olivia shifts her affections from Cesario to Sebastian and starts to see Cesario/Viola as a sibling rather than a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German colonial rule is often criticized for its harshness, particularly regarding the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa. Nonetheless, it is overly simplistic to characterize an entire colonial empire with such a broad brush. The German colonial empire featured a variety of policies and governing styles that differed across its geographic expanse. Similarly, the approach to education varied throughout the colonies. When the British took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a significant number of educated and literate Africans. German educational initiatives in Kamerun and other colonies also received commendation from contemporary writers. The situation in South West Africa (now Namibia) was markedly different. Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and was actively involved in educating the natives, education in South West Africa was largely left to missionary societies with minimal government backing. However, the government did allocate considerable resources to the education of Europeans in the colony, setting up state schools and providing more substantial support and regulation for missionary schools. These educational strategies left a lasting impact on South West Africa, persisting even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies had significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to the distinct experience of South West Africa. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors and focus on new research concerning the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is a substantial body of literature focused specifically on education within the German colonial empire. Most of these works are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The primary goal of these early writings was to describe the educational systems in these colonies. Later English-language publications broadened the discussion through comparative studies of educational practices across different German colonies and more in-depth analyses of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant variations in the educational systems across different colonies. One of the most notable works that explicitly addresses the subject of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of these two colonies and explores the factors that explain the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa accounts for many of the distinctive characteristics of the colony’s educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial holdings, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, although much of it consisted of arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans resided in South West Africa, whereas the next largest settler population was in East Africa, with only 5,336 Europeans.",
            "The United States and Mexico serve as an example of two countries that were once embroiled in a long-lasting rivalry spanning 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, gaining Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Numerous other conflicts occurred between the two nations, eventually subsiding just before World War I. The rivalry was fueled by clashes over key issues such as religion, culture, tradition, and significant material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis situation is similar to many other countries with enduring rivalries with neighboring nations. Countries sharing a border often have conflicting interests that lead to rivalries. The United States and Mexico exemplify such enduring border rivalries. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, both countries are geographically close to the United States and have been its rivals, whereas other Latin American nations have generally maintained good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences were a significant source of tension between the two countries, a problem that has historically affected many nations. Sally Frahm (2001) observes that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). Similar to the ideological and interest-based Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, the U.S.-Mexico tensions were rooted in religious preferences rather than political structures. This mistrust stemmed from the historical distrust between the English and Spanish, which both countries inherited from their colonial rulers, hindering the development of positive foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during this 57-year period of rivalry. Most of these disputes revolved around territorial issues, particularly border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier challenges. Raids by bandits and outlaws on American border towns persisted until both nations asserted military force along their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). Schmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry began to diminish as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and eventually ended as American priorities shifted \"from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p. 110) in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I unexpectedly became disabled due to an illness I had never heard of before. At that time, I was working as a nurse, a career I chose because it offered the stability and security I lacked during my childhood. The advice I frequently heard growing up was, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" Although my true aspiration was to be a scientist or journalist, or perhaps both, I opted for nursing.\n\nHowever, at 46, I found myself single, without savings, and unable to work. Even now, after 15 years on Social Security Disability, I have nothing to my name. I manage to get by, but each day is a battle affecting my sense of safety, security, and self-worth. While nothing in my life is predictable anymore, I do know one thing: I couldn't have survived these years without the support of my family and a few close friends. In times of true crisis, no matter how strong you think you are, you don't feel strong at all.\n\nMy point is that life will always have emergencies, both big and small, and no matter how well-prepared you are, some challenges are too significant to handle alone. I agree that in the U.S., we should stop relying solely on big government, which is deteriorating. Instead, I would prefer Americans to learn to trust and support one another, rather than each person retreating to build their own fallout shelters.\n\nConservatives in the U.S. often speak of \"rugged individualism\" as the foundation of our country, but in reality, what sustained our ancestors during tough times was compassion, mutual respect, and resource-sharing. The pioneers who traveled in wagon trains across the Rockies didn't reach the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in case of a biological attack. I have several flashlights, a variety of batteries, plenty of candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have land and resources for a small farm and the ability to preserve your own food, do it. It's a smart idea, as is having a wood stove, provided you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while doing all this, take the time to get to know your neighbors.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince destined to be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he gave up worldly possessions, achieved enlightenment, and his teachings eventually led to the creation of Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being its most traditional branch. Buddhism is approximately 2,500 years old, and it has evolved since the time of Buddha, evident in practices like the annual water-cutting ceremony in Theravada Buddhist Sri Lanka. This event, involving both monks and laypeople, holds religious significance, even though Buddha never mentioned such celebrations. Variations span from minor traditions to the fundamental beliefs of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both monastic and lay, has had to adapt its doctrines over time due to both internal and external influences, some of which were supportive and others adversarial.\n\nSeveral key terms are frequently used in this discussion. Internal forces originate from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic involvement, while external forces arise from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces aim to harm the Buddhist community, stemming from negative views of Buddhism, whereas benign forces neither intend to harm nor help Buddhism, although they may inadvertently do so. These terms recur throughout the discourse.\n\nTo begin, one must understand the fundamentals of the religion—the central doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka or three baskets of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka includes all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains Buddhism's metaphysical aspects. These metaphysical ideas include Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—life’s inherent suffering, and Anicca—the impermanence of all things. Understanding these concepts is essential to ending Sansara, the ongoing cycle of death and rebirth. With the cessation of Sansara comes the end of lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, upon reaching enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka establishes life rules: for laypeople, the five precepts are refraining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and consuming intoxicants. Monks have additional disciplinary rules. The core doctrinal concept in Buddhism is the four noble truths: first, Dukkha, the truth that life involves suffering; second, the truth that attachment causes suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome."
