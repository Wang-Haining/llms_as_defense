            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture is a crucial factor in negotiations. It can be understood not only by its characteristics but also by what it is not and what it represents. Culture is diverse and not a single, uniform entity. Generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are overly simplistic and broad. While grasping cultural generalizations is useful, it is more beneficial for a negotiator to comprehend the relevance of a culture to the negotiation and how its attitudes may influence discussions. When encountering a foreign culture, one tends to relate it to their own, leading to comparisons.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset might involve anything from exploring its history to recognizing its biases. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, one should accept it as it is and operate within its framework, especially in negotiations, and particularly if one is at a disadvantage. Moreover, when negotiating in unfamiliar territory, respecting traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and advance the negotiation.\n\nIt's important to remember that culture extends beyond national or international divides. Companies often develop their own corporate culture, which may prioritize long work hours or a more relaxed approach. Corporate culture is visible in employee dress codes, communication styles (direct vs. indirect), delegation of tasks, and hiring practices. Some companies support philanthropy at any employee level, while others limit it to approved charities or fundraisers. The diversity within American corporate culture, varying from company to company and even within regions, highlights the variety of thought within a societal culture. While some cultures may seem less stratified than American culture and appear more uniform, this is just a cue to explore deeper.\n\nUnderstanding values is even more crucial because they explain the reasons behind a culture's behavior. If a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superior to succeed. Similarly, a negotiator from a culture that prioritizes tough bargaining won't be quick to settle. Considering these generalities is essential before negotiations begin. However, it is beneficial for a negotiator to learn about their counterpart on a personal level to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "The phrase \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” originates in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is used by St. Anselm in his argument about God's existence. This belief is shared by Thomas Aquinas, another thinker we will examine. Since both authors argue in favor of the same idea, our task is to determine whose argument is superior. For conciseness, we will assume that they both believe in the existence of the God depicted in the Bible. Considering a different concept of God would hinder a fair comparison of their arguments, as both defend a specific notion of God. However, it seems neither author provides a comprehensive foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo explore this, we first look at St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm's perspective involves understanding through faith, suggesting that proof of God is found within oneself. He argues that since God exists in our understanding, we cannot truly imagine his nonexistence. Although his explanation can be complex and unclear, the main idea is that God's existence is confirmed by reflecting on what we inherently know to be true in our minds, without needing external evidence. This acceptance of beliefs without empirical proof is commonly called faith in Christian texts.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, on the other hand, proposes that God's existence can be established entirely through reason and empirical evidence, without the need for faith. This approach would be advantageous for evangelism, a key aspect of Christianity, as it allows for persuading new converts through logic alone. Aquinas outlines five logical arguments proving God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each, he shows that God's existence is a logical necessity. Just as you can deduce the features and existence of a missing puzzle piece by assembling the rest, you can use logic to infer the necessity of God.",
            "Authors often employ various techniques to evoke specific emotions or attitudes in their readers regarding significant topics. Some techniques are more successful than others. In his novel The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes a range of these methods. One approach involves pairing an adjective with a noun in an unconventional way to create a particular atmosphere around a subject. Another technique is assigning meaning to a symbol and using it to achieve the same effect. Fitzgerald notably employs this latter technique with colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, he assigns specific meanings to colors like white/gray and red/pink, later using these meanings to evoke certain feelings associated with important objects.\n\nFitzgerald establishes and employs the meaning of white/gray to represent uniformity, with white suggesting a higher class and gray symbolizing something older and faded. He introduces this meaning early in the novel through frequent use. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are often depicted \"in white\" (8); indeed, many characters wear white: Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only exception is when Nick observes Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further solidifies these colors by applying them to mundane subjects: Nick descends \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), guest names at Gatsby's parties are listed as \"gray names\" (61), and Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—signifying uniformity (28). He also uses white and gray to describe ordinary people or places: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" by the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald establishes enough meaning for white/gray, he uses them to denote unimportance or uniformity in certain subjects, beginning with Daisy. After a period of little use of these colors, Daisy is described as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" prompting readers to perceive her as less of a distinct character and more as a uniform addition, something Gatsby desires (74). Fitzgerald continues this portrayal of Daisy as an element of uniformity, for example, in the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18), and again in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County boasts significant agricultural productivity due to its mild and sunny climate. It commonly produces crops such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a notable demand for organic community-supported agriculture in the San Diego region, with many local groups experiencing long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Numerous organic farms offer tours of their agricultural practices and provide opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This type of operation allows landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitats, thus enabling recreational use and offering farm tours and educational programs as sources of income.\n\nIn addition to tapping into a potentially profitable niche market, organic farming often results in increased biodiversity among plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming can be more costly than conventional farming in certain respects. It demands more intensive labor and management for pest and weed control and soil fertilization without chemicals, and losses can be higher compared to conventional methods. Small organic farms also lack the efficiency of scale enjoyed by larger operations. Practices beneficial to wildlife, although not directly related to organic farming, may also increase labor expenses, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, removing invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create specific conditions like edge habitats or open ground patches. Therefore, the landowner in this scenario may seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land selected for this example is a 160-acre parcel near Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It consists of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. It is located in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which is still under review but currently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many of these species are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, while others like burrowing owls are declining and may soon be listed.\n\nThis area was home to Native Americans for countless centuries before cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers settled it in the late 1800s. The land was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing and/or wood production over many decades. I chose a property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to explore the realistic options a small farmer might have for reducing costs and maintaining wildlife-friendly operations. As a model of what someone farming this land might aim to achieve, I identified an organic farm in the same area.",
            "There exists an unbreakable and undeniable connection between brothers, filled with a multitude of emotions such as love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. This unique bond allows brothers to understand each other more deeply than anyone else could, seeing themselves reflected in one another. It is during the most critical moments that the true essence of this bond is revealed, whether for better or worse. When these emotions surface, they come at a significant cost. Understanding the feelings that arise from this fraternal connection involves dealing with the consequences they bring. Looking into a brother's eyes and seeing one's own reflection allows a person to see themselves not as others do, but as they truly are. Their true character is revealed through their actions and the repercussions of those actions. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers explore this theme, along with the intense emotions it involves. Against a richly detailed backdrop, these boys embark on a hopeless journey. In the climactic scene, bitter disappointment collides with intense pride, and only one brother survives. The theme is conveyed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which expresses the complex emotions felt by the protagonist and his view of the surrounding world, both of which greatly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by one key emotion: pride. From his first outing with his younger brother, Doodle, to their final, tragic adventure, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He had envisioned a brother he could teach skills like \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He desired a brother to \"race to Horsehead Landing... and perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn...\" These aspirations were clearly unattainable due to Doodle's condition. Doodle was born with a frail heart, making his survival uncertain, let alone his participation in strenuous activities. This was a devastating blow to the young protagonist, who had filled his head with dreams that were shattered instantly. He even felt anger towards the fragile child, once contemplating suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would consider such a drastic action? Yet, his resolve softened when Doodle smiled at him, a simple gesture that filled the protagonist with hope, indicating that his murderous intention was not deeply rooted. Deep down, he instinctively loved his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex and innovative system for processing information. As technology progressed from basic to sophisticated, so did the metaphors used to describe the brain. Initially likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, a book, and more recently, a computer, these comparisons are useful but have limitations and can lead to incorrect assumptions.  \nInformation processing begins with sensory organs receiving input, converting physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound, and light into electrochemical signals. The brain's algorithms transform this sensory information through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing compiles basic details like color, orientation, and border delineation—where color changes abruptly—to recognize the box. Top-down processing then leverages decisions from the bottom-up process to accelerate recognition, helping to identify the object as a black box rather than a hole in the white background.  \nOnce processed to a certain extent, an attention filter assesses the signal's significance and determines which cognitive processes should access it. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when looking at your shoes, a functional attention filter prevents individual recognition. Conversely, you might notice your name spoken in a noisy room. Processing occurs in multiple stages, with attention continually influencing the outcomes.  \nFor the brain to process information, it first needs storage. This involves several types of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded, with specific encoding types for each sensory input. For instance, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically. Once stored, information must be maintained. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which holds information for about 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal cycling through a series of neurons briefly. Long-term memory is thought to be maintained by the structure of certain proteins.  \nThere are various models of how the brain organizes knowledge, some based on human memory retrieval, others on computer science, and still others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, interconnected based on their relatedness. For instance, in a semantic network, “chair” might connect to “table,” which in turn connects to “wooden,” and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States was hit by a devastating financial crisis. Unemployment rose, the housing market collapsed, and several key American corporations faced severe damage. This recession continues today, prompting us to ask: what caused this crisis, and how can we prevent it? Essentially, the financial turmoil resulted from shortsighted and self-serving political choices that coerced banks and companies into approving sub-prime loans within an already fragile financial system. At the same time, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were urged to endorse and repackage these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves and shifted the resulting turmoil onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold, impacting the broader economy.\n\nThe crisis traces back to 1999 during the Clinton administration, as the President aimed to secure a second term by boosting his popularity. To achieve this, the Clinton administration loosened lending regulations, inadvertently setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. In 1999, Steven Holmes from the New York Times noted, “Fannie Mae, the nation’s largest underwriter of home mortgages, has faced growing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income individuals and felt compelled by stockholders to sustain its extraordinary profit growth.” Holmes accurately predicted the outcome of these actions: “But the government-backed corporation could encounter difficulties during an economic downturn, leading to a government bailout similar to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.” As outlined earlier, and as Holmes anticipated, reckless lending would inevitably result in economic collapse.\n\nNumerous elements contributed to the economic downturn, including the new and intricate mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were heavily utilized in the years before the crisis, further entangling more economic sectors with the housing market. This led U.S. households and financial markets overall to excessively invest in the housing market, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities suffered. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, accounting for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. Ultimately, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at remarkably low prices, Lehman Brothers was disbanded, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to become commercial banks subject to stringent regulations. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac held $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That part of your story where you can spread your wings as a writer and captivate everyone with your enchanting prose. Or, conversely, the section where readers might doze off or click away, cursing your name. Dr. Merlin has been known to yell at her screen when she's bombarded with an overload of information, and not even in an enjoyable way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy gentle readers are already familiar with the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself in lengthy segments of text where either nothing occurs or too much does. Exposition is like the little devil on your shoulder suggesting you get the history out of the way to reach the exciting parts (not to be confused with the devil on the other shoulder urging you to share every single detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition involves telling the audience what happened, usually in straightforward prose. In film, exposition occurs when one character dumps a load of information onto another, much like \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nAn example is needed. As you read a story, you learn that the heroine met her beloved at a specific place and time, that they had a grand wedding, and that her husband was murdered before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to be covered in just two pages, with only two lines of dialogue each for him and her. You would anticipate the author taking time to develop the husband's character, showing through his words and actions how deeply he loves his wife. Similarly, you would expect the heroine to demonstrate, in various ways, how his presence transformed and enriched her life (especially if the story later explicitly states this). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally invested in his fate and provide insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, the depth of their connection, hints about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as seen through his eyes, and so forth. You would mourn his death with her, thereby growing more attached to the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you would expect more substance to the simple plot line: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that substance. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, continues*) It's sometimes tempting to gloss over certain details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he was in the Air Force, he's now the night manager of a gas station, has been married twice with no kids, enjoys fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one, which was live, aired on NBC 4 on the morning of August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man named Shad Hostettler in Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife, though her name was not mentioned. They showed his mugshot, describing him as looking malevolent. This developing story was covered briefly, lasting only about two minutes. The details provided were that he had stabbed her several times and was arrested. I felt this was an appropriate amount of coverage for the situation.\n\nThe second story was about an early morning shooting involving an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers, who was critically injured in the Sharon Woods area. At the time, no arrests had been made, and there were no suspects, though the SWAT Team was investigating. This story was also short, which I suspect might be because the victim was a Black man or because it occurred in a predominantly Black neighborhood. I've noticed over the years that crimes involving minority victims often receive less attention in the media compared to similar incidents involving white individuals.\n\nAnother story covered was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were provided about where it might have happened, and it was determined that the helicopter had been hit by a .22 caliber rifle bullet. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThe newscast also mentioned the forecast of rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with weekend temperatures expected to remain in the mid to low eighties. The weather segment was brief, likely used as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nAnother report focused on a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned Black man wearing a hoodie, approximately six feet tall and weighing about 150 pounds. I found it unusual how much emphasis was placed on his race and skin tone.\n\nLastly, there was a story about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin from Texas, found guilty of conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana to Ohio. Interestingly, instead of stating his sentence as 25 years, they said \"300 months,\" which might have been intended to sound harsher. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, which I felt was irrelevant to the story.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of security that aims to mirror the performance of an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund. However, it offers greater flexibility because it trades like a stock on an exchange. This type of fund provides the diversification benefits of an index fund while offering advantages akin to owning individual stocks, such as the ability to sell short, purchase on margin, and buy as little as one share per transaction. Despite these appealing features, ETFs typically have much lower expense ratios than the average mutual fund. However, there are drawbacks, such as the requirement to pay a commission on any ETF trade, similar to stock transactions. Another advantage of ETFs is the broad range of available funds. It is important for astute financial investors to assess whether the proclaimed benefits, like diversification, truly exist and to what degree. In this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to determine if owning a single ETF offers similar benefits to owning a diversified portfolio of these ten stocks, and whether alternative configurations of these stocks could yield a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo assess the ETF, we will focus only on the top ten holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets, rather than every holding. Listed below are these top 10 holdings and their percentage of total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these ten stocks reflect the overall ETF IHF, we can use their current percentage of assets, standardized to 100%, to calculate their contributions to a portfolio’s Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consists solely of these 10 stocks in the proportions established by the ETF's holdings. The calculated Beta and return are shown in the chart below.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings yields a return that is 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. It also indicates that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than that of the entire ETF. Thus far, the analysis suggests that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings might offer higher returns with lower beta. However, it is possible that the average outcomes of these two portfolios are not statistically different from each other. To determine if these portfolios are statistically distinct, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is calculated and normalized to 100% to compare their combined standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Referring to Figure 17, there was a sharp decline in the number of commuter log submissions during the project's third month. This was somewhat disappointing, and the reasons for this decrease are not entirely clear. The arrival of winter at a New England campus likely led to fewer people commuting by bicycle or on foot, which could explain part of the reduction. December also coincides with the conclusion of the fall semester, a time when everyone is preoccupied with completing schoolwork, grading, and related tasks, possibly causing the commuter log to be overlooked. Moreover, the busy holiday season begins in December, bringing a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many do not need to visit campus. Classes resume for the spring semester in late January, potentially contributing to the low log submissions during that month. However, this does not fully account for the low submissions in February. It's possible that projects like this experience an initial surge of enthusiasm that later wanes. To counteract this trend, we organized Carpool Challenge Week, a special campaign in March to revitalize the initiative, which successfully increased log submissions for that month. Maintaining project momentum was challenging due to both a natural decline in engagement and the specific issues of holiday and semester breaks typical in higher education. \n\nAnother challenge for this project, as with any alternative commuting initiative, is that people value the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars, which is deeply ingrained in our culture. Therefore, it's crucial to offer incentives for alternative commuting methods. We distributed numerous prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see how even larger prizes might have impacted participation, such as offering a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This might have helped counteract the drop in engagement the project faced. The nature of the prizes remained consistent throughout the project. However, increasing the value of the prizes over time might have been beneficial. While the gift cards were sufficient at the project's start, announcing additional incentives like bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January could have potentially boosted participation and engagement, rather than seeing a decline.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all fifteen trick films made between 1895 and 1901. These films typically utilize creative editing to create illusions. My analysis primarily focused on describing the artistic elements of most trick films and identifying unique evolutionary traits in a few of the later ones. Generally, trick films from the turn of the century were confined to a set, shot within a frontal proscenium, lacked camera movement, employed long and medium shots, and followed a strict one shot equals one film approach. However, some films from the early 1900s began to challenge these norms by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA prominent feature shared by these trick films is the use of an interior set framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, not tracking any movement of figures or objects. This style was typical of early films, influenced by theatrical traditions and, specifically for trick films, vaudeville and magic performances. One limitation of this stage-based approach is that characters in trick films mainly move side-to-side, without approaching or retreating from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move horizontally. Even when they exit the frame, the camera stays in place.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition also results in mostly long shots, with medium shots being less common, and no close-ups appearing in any of the Edison trick films. This mirrors the theatre and vaudeville conventions, where audiences saw the entire performance framed by the stage boundaries. As with most early films, actors do not move towards the camera from the middle ground, so close-ups are absent.\n\nTypically, early trick films follow the principle that a single conceptual shot constitutes a whole film. This restricts the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frame rate used, and limits their dramatic or narrative potential; they mainly focus on short vaudeville-like tricks, such as magic or disappearing acts, with minimal story. However, in trick films, a conceptual shot perceived by the viewer doesn’t necessarily mean a single physical shot. A “shot” might actually comprise several edited together to create illusions of appearance or disappearance. For example, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a closer examination reveals the transition to the shot with Mary's severed \"head,\" even though the entire film is perceived as one continuous shot by the viewer.",
            "The classic \"Gothic Novel\" is, as Ian Watt points out in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, an oxymoron signifying \"Old-New.\" This literary style has been both criticized and praised, accused of lacking depth, and admired for its ability to evoke a 'terrible sublime' (Burke). Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the first \"Gothic Novel,\" combined elements from both \"ancient and modern\" romances to forge the proto-Gothic genre and a new way of literary expression. Walpole incorporated \"old\" theatrical traditions with 'new' natural mimicry from 'modern' novels to create what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre extensively references medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and customs. Even during the publication of The Castle of Otranto, \"gothic\" described various peoples, styles, and eras, often seen as outdated or crude compared to \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The blend of theatrical \"Gothic\" with the novel's new format, which offered readers a more intimate glimpse into characters' psychology, has enabled the Gothic to endure over time, being simultaneously obsolete and fresh to readers far removed from its inception.\n\nA key gothic theme in Gothic novels is the idea of Chivalry. In The Castle of Otranto, the medieval concept of chivalry—the training of a proper knight—is both preserved and transformed. Chivalry holds significant appeal for Gothic authors because it symbolizes the classic knight, brave, honorable, and capable, and the perceived absence of such ideals in society, as seen by writers like Walpole. By employing chivalric ideals and manners, the \"gothic past\" becomes idealized and romanticized (foreshadowing the Gothic's evolution into Romantic) and is used to critique and potentially enhance the present. When writing The Castle of Otranto, Walpole was amidst political turmoil and despondent about the future. Immersed in politics and possibly facing unjust accusations, he might have, even if subconsciously, felt that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" of the gothic era had been lost in contemporary society. This sentiment is evident in his characters, such as Frederic. Before meeting Frederic, readers learn he embodies many chivalric traits; he is depicted as:\n\nFrederic's description is filled with traditional chivalric imagery; he is primarily a prince, who has endured suffering, been properly affected by tragedy, left his home, and is believed to have been slain by infidels. The portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, introducing the Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the sequence of actions required to transfer goods from a customer's order through the stages of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution until they reach the customer. The concept of supply chain management was introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver. He explained the comprehensive process of planning, executing, and overseeing supply chain activities to meet customer needs promptly and efficiently. The six essential components of a supply chain are production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nThe initial step in the supply chain process is production, which serves as the basis for the entire system. This stage involves determining the timing, reasoning, location, and methodology for production. Managers must understand customer preferences, which can be gauged by examining the market. The market is a primary indicator of customer demands. Once managers have assessed the market and comprehend customer needs, they can decide on the products to be manufactured and their quantities. After these decisions, they choose the most suitable production site, considering factors like volume and quality while ensuring customer demands and satisfaction are met. Following the selection of a production location, managers concentrate on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Production is a critical phase in the supply chain, where attention to detail is crucial, as inadequate planning can result in significant time and financial losses for the company. For instance, in my experience at Wal-Mart and Target, both companies had structured guidelines and processes for various business aspects, including employee uniforms and shipment receipt. Clearly defined processes enable smooth operation without confusion about direction and expectations.\n\nThe second crucial component of supply chain management is supply. Supply involves making strategic decisions to determine a facility’s core capabilities, which subsequently guide the development of outsourcing partnerships. A company might have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with distinct equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers need to identify which division is best suited for different stages of production. They might also opt to outsource work to other companies, primarily to achieve velocity. Velocity refers to the capacity to deliver quality and flexibility while simultaneously reducing or maintaining low costs.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the era. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights are considered Victorian novels that deviate from this norm. These two works incorporate elements of mystery and a penchant for the unusual, which are not typical of the period's literature, thereby enhancing the characters and providing deeper insights into their motives and emotions.\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of firearms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nBoth novels frequently use mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the content and purpose differ in each case. In Oliver Twist, these strange events often reveal insights into Oliver’s inner struggles, his pain, and his awareness of the true nature of the events around him. When Oliver's shooting is revisited in chapter 28, he experiences the event as if in a vivid dream, struggling to find help. The passage highlights Oliver’s lack of control over unfolding events and the severe state of his health, as emphasized by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing his senses so much that he fails to notice the \"unseen hand\" that carries him away; he relives his despair, now intertwined with constant pain and fear rather than surprise. This raises the question of who is responsible for his misfortune, as it was clearly not his own doing. The shooting underscores Oliver's lack of control, showing that he cannot even attempt to alter the outcome of events, even when his life is at stake. This passage suggests a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, compelling him to accept this despair and affecting his ability to respond. Otherwise, it could be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least to save his own life.\n\n\"The day passed off—day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come—and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years back, I was involved in an after-school program where I tutored elementary students. I tried my best to assist them in any subject they found challenging, although my expertise was in English and reading. An instructor asked me to help a young boy named Adrian, likely in third or fourth grade, who was facing significant difficulties with reading. I noticed something unusual; he had inconsistent issues with letter pronunciation—some he nailed perfectly, while others were completely off. Adrian was clearly of Latino descent, yet he spoke flawless English. We struggled until one day I met his mother. I was looking after a few students left behind while the rest went on a field trip when she came in. She didn't speak English, only Spanish. Despite my limited Spanish skills, we managed to understand each other. It then struck me: Adrian was proficient in reading but wasn't well-versed in the English alphabet. I can't say for sure if this realization helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, particularly in California. It also illustrates that these challenges aren't always apparent. Even a child fluent in spoken English can face significant hurdles in reading. We all recognize this problem, but what's the solution? In Adrian's situation, the fix was straightforward: focused tutoring in English reading, especially on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children with limited English skills, the solution is more complex. There's no single answer. A combination of dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes is essential.\n\nTo begin, the dual language system is a promising approach, beneficial not just for Spanish-speaking children but for all. Research shows that children in bilingual programs often outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns that such programs might squander resources or benefit only a few, this is untrue. If these programs became standard rather than exceptions, all students would gain. But how do we implement this? Demanding all teachers to be bilingual isn't practical. Nevertheless, there's no reason we can't employ bilingual aides or tutors.",
            "From a young age, many of us are taught that there exists something greater than ourselves, something beyond our comprehension. Some of us attend Sunday school to learn about it, others go to Temple, or seek answers within. Many easily accept the religions passed down by our parents, while others reject them entirely, believing nothing exists beyond their personal, self-centered world. We might embrace one set of beliefs only to later adopt another. Regardless of the path we take, we strive to understand ourselves through our own spiritual perspectives, seeking a guiding light to lead us from darkness to light.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father replied when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on our front porch, listening to the rain on the tin roof while we smoked. The gutters overflowed, soaking the plants by the porch. My father stared into the rain, a gaze that seemed both searching and remembering. He had become thinner, his clothes hanging loosely, and his hair was sparser than I remembered. He continued to look into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt isolated, frightened, unable to express how much I would miss him, fearing that speaking about it would make it more real. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer to his, and joined him in watching the June twilight rain.\n\nMy father passed away that December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation only prolonged his suffering beyond the doctors’ expectations, providing no comfort. I questioned the kind of God who would allow this. Alone at night, I offered no prayers, thinking if God existed, He had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI didn’t want to witness his transition from this life to another, so I didn’t. I couldn’t watch the life that created me come to an end. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father wouldn’t want his only child to witness his death. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and fervent supporter of Republicanism. Though he was mainly a farmer, his profession and brief political career made him known for his commitment and outspoken views on personal freedom and governance. His belief in an agrarian system formed the foundation of nearly all his governmental opinions. His efforts to uphold and promote what he saw as the noblest profession shaped his views on sovereignty, constitutionality, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a unique chance to establish an ideal system, as there was no existing tradition to constrain the government’s founders, enabling the creation of a self-governing system. He was a strong advocate for natural rights and believed they were interlinked—if one right is denied, all will fail, diminishing the value of the remaining rights. Therefore, these rights should be protected from government interference. He argued that in the so-called \"state of nature,\" those with physical strength and cunning intelligence thrived, but this should not be the case in a civilized society.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor argued for a government that acknowledges the inherent good and evil within humans. He held firm views on dualistic morality, stating, “As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human” (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalism, believing a government based on such principles would function fairly regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by greed and self-interest. Taylor saw self-interest as a universal motivator but considered it only evil when it led to the formation of sub-societies that thrived at others’ expense. A good government was essential to restrain man's inherent evil, requiring constant vigilance to prevent the incorporation of harmful principles.\n\nLike many committed Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a highly limited Federal government, permitting only the rights and powers explicitly stated in the Constitution. He recognized that a large Federal government was costly and likely to become tyrannical. However, he believed that a straightforward, literal interpretation could be perilous, as it could easily become corrupt without considering the writers’ intentions. Furthermore, he viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true foundation of the United States, as it more clearly defined the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind trying to take in the view without attaching any deeper meaning to it. With a calm detachment and a practiced eye, I examined the scene before me, my thoughts fleeting in and out so quickly that it felt as if I wasn't really thinking, just experiencing the sight fluidly. \n\nOnce, following a suggestion from an artist I knew, I bought a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had longed to learn drawing since I was six, and this book covered everything from understanding a pencil to how the brain interprets lines. One method it taught was to use a square frame to focus on any picture, simplifying a complex scene—like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room—into a more manageable image, just the fruit on a simple surface.\n\nAt that moment, staring at the bowl before me, I couldn't mentally apply the artist’s frame. I was too overwhelmed, too struck with awe, only able to stand and marvel. Picasso had his blue period, Monet adored greenery, and the Italian Renaissance masters reveled in a spectrum of colors. If I fancied my viewpoint to be worthy of the title \"Artistic,\" then the scene before me was the inception of my piece, my story, Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers touched my chosen tool of creativity, muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand moved, my mind's intent taking shape in what might have been my most creative moment. Water swirled, calm and clear, as particles broke away and disappeared. Muscles tightened, jerking more anxiously the second time as my hand hit the toilet handle again. The stubborn brown mass remained, stuck like a slug at the toilet’s bottom.\n\nHolding the mop loosely, feet apart, and my green tie uncomfortably tight, I frowned at the unpleasant bundle of processed matter left as a message for the unlucky ones cleaning the Rite Aid bathrooms. Several more flushes, a few more calm moments of introspection, then my hand reached for the toilet paper, wrapping itself until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing upright, then bending at the waist, my hand slowly dipped into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Teen fatalities in car accidents are a growing concern. Various factors contribute to this alarming trend among the youngest drivers in America. According to the National Institutes of Health, one issue is that teenagers' brains are not fully developed to handle the dangers of driving. Additionally, their lack of experience greatly contributes to the problem, leading to more fatal crashes, increased instances of rollovers, speeding, and veering off the road. Teenagers are particularly at risk when driving with peers, a common occurrence. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a link between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents. \n\nTo address this, California and other states have introduced provisional licenses that limit driving hours and restrict other minors from being passengers. However, these measures are temporary solutions. The fundamental problem is that young drivers, as a group, are statistically unable to manage driving risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman suggests that even at 18, individuals may be too young for a standard driver's license. His research, cited by USA Today, indicates that people under 19-20 often seek risky experiences for excitement. It would be logical to postpone driving until this thrill-seeking tendency diminishes. Issuing licenses to young teens could lead to even more deadly accidents, potentially increasing fatalities as more Baby Boomer offspring become eligible to drive by 2010.\n\nLegislation to address this could be relatively simple. Schools could continue offering driver's education to prepare future drivers, but no one under 18 should drive. A provisional permit could still be issued before a full license, requiring a set number of driving hours, similar to existing state requirements (such as California's six hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours with an adult). Since teen driving fatalities are a nationwide issue, uniform national legislation would be an effective way to safeguard teenagers across the country. This proposal is not a new concept.",
            "This document explores three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with a concise definition of the disorder, followed by an explanation of the diagnosis process, highlighting common characteristics or \"red flags.\" The paper concludes by discussing how teachers in mainstream classrooms can support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), pertains to how efficiently and effectively the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. More specifically, (C)AP involves the CNS's perceptual processing of auditory information and the neurobiological activity that supports this processing, which results in electrophysiologic auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it is a disorder where the brain struggles to process auditory inputs correctly. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally and are not considered \"hearing impaired\"; rather, the brain area responsible for interpreting auditory information, such as distinguishing words or separating conversation from background noise, does not function as expected.\n\nThe earliest reference to what is now known as CAPD dates back to the mid-1950s under the term \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), during research on children with communication disorders. The Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954. In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and developed a model to explain the physiology of the central auditory nervous system (CANS) related to dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 sparked further research into CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways: individuals may struggle to locate or perceive sound spatially, have difficulty distinguishing between multiple sounds, fail to recognize sound patterns, or be unable to detect changes in speech tone (such as sarcasm). Sounds may be masked by subsequent sounds, there may be an inability to synthesize auditory clues meaningfully, and there might be difficulty identifying the sequence of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves screening through \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,\" which can be conducted by audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and other professionals using various measures to assess auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires, surveys, and observations of auditory behaviors, such as the patient's responses to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single tool or test with consistently high diagnostic success, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Many tests present the patient with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and require them to differentiate certain items, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the corresponding responses.",
            "In my pursuit of a social work education, my goal is to build a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on assisting children who have experienced abuse or neglect and offering support to families in distress. The values I bring to the field of social work include service, respect, ethical conduct, a commitment to enhancing relationships, and a dedication to my own professional development to ensure competence in my field. These principles are not only vital to social workers but also personally significant to me.\n\nI have always wanted to help others, though I was initially uncertain about which career path to choose. During my high school and college years, I observed many people avoiding their issues or adopting inadequate coping strategies. These experiences motivated me to earn a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Still unsure of my career direction, I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, a visit to a friend introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy seeking refuge from abusive parents. The next day, when he contacted the police regarding his home situation, I visited his parents' house to see if I could assist. I shared my concerns with the police, mentioning my recent psychology degree, and they asked me to speak with the parents since legal action could not be taken for the teenager. In questioning the parents, they appeared anxious and offered excuses, describing their son's actions as manipulative in involving outsiders for what they called \"simple\" family disputes. This experience made me seriously consider a career in social work to assist children facing \"simple\" family conflicts.\n\nSocial justice is another crucial value in social work. While society professes the importance of the individual and mourns those we lose, it often values conformity over genuine individuality. If society truly values the individual, why do we strive to be like everyone else? I consider myself an individual and resist conforming to societal norms. Throughout high school and college, I opposed social injustice through various means, such as dyeing my hair unconventional colors, wearing clothes that reflected my personality, getting multiple ear piercings, participating in GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and standing against racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. I am committed to social justice and will continue to challenge social injustices.",
            "This paper examines the Biological and Sociocultural models as they pertain to insomnia. The biological model emphasizes inherited genetic traits and medical health factors. In contrast, the Sociocultural model considers environmental interactions and their relevance to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The review analyzes research on insomnia, clarifying how each study relates to and enhances the understanding of these models, while also assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the findings.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified as primary disorders, those linked to another mental disorder, or those associated with other conditions. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, whereas disorders related to mental health are connected to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorders might arise from medical issues or substance use. Dyssomnias comprise Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves challenges in achieving or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia involves difficulty staying awake, both persisting for at least a month. Narcolepsy is characterized by cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. While Dyssomnias focus on sleep onset and maintenance, Parasomnias involve behavioral or physiological abnormalities during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Disorders linked to other mental health issues involve sleep disturbances caused by Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Intellectual Disabilities). This review centers on insomnia, with a partial focus on primary sleep disorders, in relation to biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genetic, hereditary, and physiological aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus that contain orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. Research on mice demonstrated that GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are crucial for sleep/wake regulation. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, and inhibiting it may reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist baclofen was shown to increase sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that results from animal studies may be applicable to humans, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. Issues with this receptor could impair sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if such a phenotype is inherited, it could disrupt sleep naturally, adversely affecting areas like education, employment, and daily tasks requiring concentration.",
            "I have been attending University Park for approximately two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many students, myself included. During my freshman year, I was assigned a dorm room in East Halls, which is nearly at the easternmost edge of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my residence at Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes, especially during the frequent inclement weather in State College. An alum, not much older than me, shared that in the past, East Halls were separated from the rest of the university by vast stretches of unused land. Nowadays, that space has been developed with sports fields, large new buildings such as the new Creamery and health services building, and is surrounded by apartments. As our campus continues to grow, moving around becomes increasingly difficult. What is the best way to tackle this mobility issue? On a college campus, it's the bicycle. However, simply having bikes isn't enough. Students need to use them, and the campus infrastructure must cater to cyclists' needs.\n\nI recently spoke to a friend who started cycling again after several years. He remarked that he wondered why he ever stopped, saying, “Bikes are great. For a while, it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” Besides being beneficial for health, cycling is the most efficient mode of transport. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many other undergraduates, I now live off-campus, at a distance comparable to some dorms from the campus center. The smartest choice I made this year was buying a bike. I have a class in the Thomas building daily, which is a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Biking can reduce that time to just 5 minutes if I ride fast enough. The only issue is that Pollock Road, the most direct route to the Thomas building from my house, can be challenging to travel on, whether by bike or on foot. Walking has its advantages, but personally, I’m too busy to walk. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable way to get to class. Walking to Thomas every day would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day, totaling over two and a half hours each week. This doesn't include all the additional time I'd spend walking to other classes and appointments. That's more time than I can afford to lose.",
            "In \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley critiques the looming dangers of technology and the capitalist framework that supports it by depicting a dystopian society. In this society, individuals prioritize community over personal identity and are conditioned from birth to seek immediate gratification above all else. The citizens are mere instruments in a larger scheme, restricted to a single ideology as directed by the World Controller. A Marxist analysis of the novel reveals Huxley's underlying concerns about the growth of these systems. Marxist concepts like homogeny and reification help underscore that Huxley's work critiques the flaws in the emerging economy of his era.\n\nCapitalism is mocked using the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where ordinary people are kept from understanding their true economic relationships with other classes because they are focused on personal gain. This is attributed to the ideological control over the proletariat and common laborers, clearly demonstrated by the conditioning in \"Brave New World.\" The lower classes, such as Delta and Gamma, lack true autonomy; hypnopaedia enforces their desire to consume and indulge above all else, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, the domination of social classes by another group, is evident here. The lower classes are unaware of this manipulation, literally buying into an ideology that sustains capitalist and consumerist structures. The upper classes, born with awareness, largely do nothing; few Alphas or Betas, like Bernard, challenge their roles. The interactions between social classes highlight the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" authentic relationships between individuals do not exist. The novel intentionally avoids distinguishing its characters, even major ones, who lack depth. Huxley may be suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism strips individuals of free will and self-expression. Love and extreme emotions are absent, with interactions remaining superficial, as shown by male characters' comments on women's physical traits and women's candid discussions about their encounters. Additionally, each class's acceptance of its position in the hierarchy reflects the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their complete compliance with their societal role illustrates Marxist views on the proletariat, falsely assured of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform with their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. A major topic of intense debate in the class was whether Islam is a hostile religion. I feel that this question is even more pertinent today than it was before. Reflecting on the events since 9/11, I have seen the mass media shift from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme form of tolerance for Islam in America. I doubt that back in 2001, we would have ever seen a presidential candidate with the name Barack Obama, who has a clear Muslim heritage in his family.\n\nThe Prophet's biography fascinates me because, based on what I know of Muhammad's history, it seems to contradict his personality. From my past knowledge and learning, I believed that Muhammad compelled conversions to Islam. He would conquer tribes and then force them to adopt Islam. However, according to the biography, Muhammad is portrayed as a sort of martyr, misunderstood and humble before others, after which people gradually came to acknowledge the 'truth' in his teachings and sought him out.\n\nAdditionally, there are striking similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad. Most notably, he multiplied mutton and milk to feed more than forty men. This style of writing suggests that the authors wanted Muhammad to be seen as a humble prophet who needed no validation, living simply in truth and miracles. This kind of portrayal is problematic because it diminishes the miracles and life of Jesus Christ. To me, it seems like they are trying to take credit for Jesus's life and identity through Muhammad.\n\nMoreover, the biography contains numerous stories suggesting that part of its aim is to provide evidence of how people supposedly 'independently' converted to Islam. However, many stories are from at least a third-party perspective, with the author describing information as heard from someone who heard from someone else, and so on. I found this troubling because, even though their intention was to provide proof of the stories' truth, it seemed to undermine the stories and make them more suspicious.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is how they attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. Yet, history contradicts the notion of Muhammad as a gentle and humble man, and I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus were quickly set aside as Christian thought developed after his life. Looking at history broadly, Christianity appears to have diverged significantly from its origins. In today's world, there is a growing awareness and a strong progressive trend. While traditionalists remain and resist thinking beyond what they've been taught, they may not be influential enough to sway the entire population. Among Christians, historical awareness is expected to rise significantly in the coming years, sparking a desire to separate the doctrines added over time from the original intentions of Jesus. This process may take decades or centuries, but it seems inevitable: a significant shift in Christian history will occur, reverting back to its original form. A movement will grow, peeling away layers of doctrine until only the essence of what Jesus introduced remains. When this trend spreads across the United States and Europe, encouraging people to worship as if they were living during Jesus' time, the church as an institution will continue to lead. However, as the theological landscape shifts backward, the diversity within Christianity will give way to increased uniformity in belief and practice. Instead of differences, there will be growing similarities between regions, denominations, and divisions. History is full of such reversions; for example, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, yet that empire later became a Christian institution. Similarly, the country moved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The forthcoming reversion will unfold within Christianity, seeking its roots and reducing diversity. An essential part of this process will be interpreting Jesus’ words metaphorically rather than literally. So, what happened since Jesus' time? Looking back in history, we find only Judaism, the theological foundation for Christianity. Monotheism, the idea of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion by the time Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish community was not unified, with divisions among Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of common people.",
            "I think The Jungle demonstrates that humans are inherently greedy and self-centered, primarily looking out for their own interests and improving their lives, without concern for those below them. The book illustrates this in several ways, notably through the owners and managers of large factories. Their sole focus is on expanding their businesses, without regard for anyone or anything that might suffer due to their progress. Upton Sinclair's description highlights the environmental harm caused by pollution: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair aims to portray the significant damage this smoke causes, showing how the factory owners ignore the impact on people and animals. They disregard the smoke clouds from their factories and the waste runoff from the numerous pens in Packingtown. \n\nThe factory owners and managers were indifferent to the plight of their workers who toiled to enrich them. They would go to any lengths to increase their profits, as illustrated by the notion that \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Employees endured terrible working hours and could be laid off in large numbers without notice, compensation, or assistance in finding new jobs. During the period in which The Jungle is set, there were few, if any, laws or regulations to protect workers' safety or welfare. This lack of oversight allowed managers and owners to exploit their workforce, demanding increased productivity under harsh conditions. Although not stated explicitly, the book suggests that those living and working in Packingtown were expected to endure poor conditions both at work and in their living environment. There were no organizations to inform or assist the workers. While unions existed, they often exploited the workers instead of helping them, profiting from their struggles. The workers were treated so poorly, with no escape from the Packingtown system, that they were likened to slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is considered by Edgar Allan Poe to be one of his finer poems. In it, he uses the term \"Thulé\" twice, in lines 6 and 56, a reference that Mabbott links back to Virgil. Virgil mentioned Thulé as an island north of Britain, which the Greeks believed to be the boundary of the known world. While Virgil indeed used this term, there is also a more contemporary source that deserves attention—Poe's interest in German authors. This connection is significant as it highlights Poe's familiarity with Goethe's works. In his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" Karl J. Arndt discusses the similarities between Poe's and Goethe's poems, suggesting that Poe was influenced by Goethe.\n\nThe \"Oxford Companion to English Literature\" notes that Goethe was renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts, with the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of his death. In the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem narrates the story of a king who, after his wife's death, becomes consumed by grief and drinking. He eventually decides to die, passing his possessions to his children, except for a goblet his wife gave him. He throws the goblet into the ocean and dies on a cliff. The somber mood of \"The King of Thulé\" mirrors the portrayal of the king in \"Dream-Land,\" possibly reflecting Poe's own experiences of loss and reliance on alcohol. Additionally, \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, just before Poe used the term Thulé in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe references Thulé twice in his works: once using \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a dark and lonely Thulé, haunted by memories of dead friends and a colorless world. These themes resonate with Goethe's \"The King of Thulé,\" where the king, grieving his wife's death, becomes desolate and loses his will to live. It is as if the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" is stepping into the world of Goethe’s poem.\n\nGoethe was a significant author whom Poe would have been aware of, partly due to his admiration for Tennyson. Poe's exposure to Goethe’s works would have been likely, given their widespread reproductions following their original publication.",
            "In California, could a customer injured by slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be granted punitive damages if the store manager acted with malice, having been informed twice about the spill but neglecting to clean it for 30 minutes due to being on a dinner break? A judge might not immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To justify such a claim, the plaintiff must show that the defendant acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm their actions could cause and that the behavior was despicable. Palmer could argue that Martin should have been aware of the potential harm from not cleaning the spill, given that several D&D customers had been injured from similar incidents in the preceding months. Despite this awareness, he still failed to address the spill. While Palmer's claim that Martin's actions were despicable is less convincing, it is still reasonable considering that six slip-and-fall accidents occurred in 2009, yet Martin did not take the necessary steps to ensure store safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed his manager, Paul Martin, of an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin, on his dinner break, replied that he \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin of the spill, receiving the same response. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill and suffered a severe back injury. Before Palmer’s accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the claim for punitive damages.\n\nIn California, punitive damages can be recovered for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice,\" according to Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Malice is defined as conduct intended to cause harm, or if there is no intent, the conduct must be \"despicable\" and done with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others,\" as per § (c)(1). Courts have deemed conduct malicious when done with a conscious disregard for the plaintiff’s rights, recognizing the likely dangerous outcomes of the conduct and willfully failing to prevent those outcomes.

            "She had always felt as though something was missing in her life. This insatiable yearning began when she was around 14, just stepping into her teenage years, and persisted even at 17. Over time, she realized she craved someone, not something. However, she hadn't felt drawn to any boys. Some tried to court her, awkwardly attempting to win over someone seemingly uninterested, yet none captured her attention. She frequently pondered this peculiar feeling, trying to understand why it was happening to her. Despite years of reflection leading to various theories, none were convincing enough for her to entertain seriously. So she continued living, always questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was typically serene. Her parents were calm and kind, rarely arguing with each other and seldom with her. Their only disagreements revolved around her expression of independence and free spirit. Although she was the child of a tranquil couple, her vibrant and lively personality contrasted with theirs, making her very likable due to her kindness.\n\nToday, however, was different. As she wandered from room to room seeking inspiration, she heard a sudden scream from the kitchen, her mother's melodic voice. Panicking, she rushed in, exclaiming, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the floor, clearly in pain, repeatedly gasping \"Ow.\" Her daughter hurried to her side, trying to help. \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need you to take me to... the hospital,\" her mother uttered, her words strained and hurried, conveying her severe discomfort. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up,\" she responded. Guided by her mother, she managed to carry her, thankful for the strength she had gained from classes. She placed her mother in the back of the car and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital visit was filled with the smells of disinfectant and illness, mixed with anxiety. But she wasn't focused on that, her mind was occupied with aiding her mother. She swiftly carried her inside and called for medical assistance. Concerned faces gathered, and someone quickly brought a rolling bed, laying her mother on it. They took her away for immediate medical attention, leaving her daughter to anxiously wait.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a step stool while attempting to retrieve a vase from their highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke-related deaths. The aMed diet is an adapted form of the Med diet, characterized by increased intake of plant-based foods like plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (as opposed to saturated fats), and fish, while reducing the consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective research found an inverse relationship between Med diet adherence and the risk of overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, and an intervention study revealed that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in obese individuals. Previous studies did not specifically address stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without prior CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score on six occasions using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) to evaluate nutrient intake over the previous year. Over 95% of nurses continued their participation throughout the 20-year duration. FFQs were validated through studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified by reviewing medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, incidents were classified as \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions categorized this way. For each FFQ, body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated, and from 1986 onward, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation for individuals and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were computed (averaging scores from the previous two years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that might skew results) by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard models were employed to evaluate the association between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as shown by a greater aMed diet score, was linked to a reduced risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, there were 2,391 new cases of CHD, 1,763 new cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (including fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The sign reads, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\"\n\nEllen Page, known for her role in Juno, is standing by herself on a street corner, holding up a piece of cardboard with this disturbing message written in Sharpie. Burma, also referred to as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a repressive military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, the country saw a series of street protests, the first in a decade. These demonstrations, led by many Burmese monks, were dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution\" in reference to the color of the monks' robes. Initially, the general public began to support the protests, and while the government initially tolerated the monks' peaceful gatherings, the situation soon escalated into a violent conflict between the monks and the junta. The military began storming and looting monasteries nationwide. Foreign journalists were detained and jailed immediately, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed on September 27, 2007, just for being at a protest. Although the official death count stands at 13, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army just before the report was released, claimed, \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is not a new phenomenon. While these are some recent examples of global atrocities, the tendency of governments to suppress opposition and maintain total control has existed as long as civilization. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine selection to rule every aspect of society. Japanese emperors were believed to be gods themselves, sent to lead their people to prosperity, with Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri being part of their influence. Meanwhile, our current president, George W. Bush, regularly consults with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subgroup of the Republic Party.\n\nNotable examples of such governmental actions include the June 4, 1989, protest in Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students protested against authoritarian rule. The death toll for this event varies significantly, with Chinese government reports citing 200-300 deaths, while the Chinese Red Cross reported between 2,000-3,000 deaths. Another example is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias, supported by the Rwandan government, systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of ethnicity. Hitler's \"Third Reich,\" encompassing several years and countries, involved the mass murder of people of Jewish descent and stands as another extreme instance.",
            "Duke Ellington's impact on jazz is largely rooted in his long career and his exceptional talent in shaping his orchestra. While his piano presence is understated in many compositions chosen for this task, Ellington's prowess as a composer shines through his ability to craft intricate and layered pieces that highlight his band members' individual talents. He provided a framework for soloists to improvise freely while also composing tightly orchestrated pieces that leveraged the unique styles of his musicians to bring out musical themes. This approach allowed him to emphasize the overall tone of the orchestra, producing coherent and unique sounds tailored to each piece. Ellington's understanding of each player's sound and their role within the ensemble enabled him to create some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, when discussing Ellington's sound and innovation, cites \"Creole Love Call\" as an example of his use of voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This piece showcases Ellington's early use of voice to add texture and color without lyrics. \"Creole Love Call\" also highlights Ellington's ability to complement his soloists' styles, a trait evident throughout his career. The piece is a slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues with six choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A call and response between voice and reeds, starting smooth and melodic, and ending with a rougher tone.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that builds on the basic melody and emphasizes extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, where the reeds initiate the call and response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: Returns to the structure of the first chorus, with a call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice uses a \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: A brief tag with a vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending.\n\nEllington's use of voice to enhance the tonal color in this piece exemplifies a stylistic trait prevalent in his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington merges his skill in tight orchestration with his sensitivity to tone color. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing blends Miley's vocal-like trumpet playing with Cox's instrumental vocal qualities to create a rich and complementary sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" expands on these ideas, with Ellington effectively utilizing Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a key member of his orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the specific ways they do? Are there any limitations or constraints that affect the path of evolutionary change? In 1917, D’Arcy Thompson remarked that \"even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" and this observation still holds true today. Recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to broader aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis across both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research aims to investigate how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, along with experimental studies, can clarify the mechanisms behind the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental change. We utilized X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters for modeling both hypothetical and actual skeletal shapes. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We created models of hypothetical shell shapes to interpret the limits of possible morphological change in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to enhance our understanding of macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be considered a structure that acts as a tube traveling over time through 360 degrees of space. The revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are termed whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which the whorls grow can vary, and each whorl is separated by a continuous line called a suture. Typically, the largest whorl of a shell is the last one, known as the body whorl. The spire includes all whorls except the last, with the apex being the tip of the spire and the opposite end referred to as the base. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed in apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. (The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex pointing upwards.)\n\nThe following method is used for counting whorls. First, view the shell from the apical perspective and identify where the first suture begins. Then, draw a line dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line, estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. It is possible to trace the aperture's path using the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture, as well as the horizontal and vertical radii of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented both graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical formulation is established, it becomes possible to adjust parameters and alter the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Over the past decade, the neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia have shown little change. Although the country is progressing towards achieving several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, the advancements in child and maternal health are insufficient to meet the 2015 targets. The reasons for these gaps will be explored further, highlighting the need to bolster the health system rather than merely implementing programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made strides in ensuring that more births are attended by skilled health workers, with 72% now achieving this benchmark. However, this figure includes traditional practitioners like midwives who cannot perform medical interventions in complicated pregnancies, contributing to a high rate of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. Thus, the progress in this area is somewhat deceptive, and significant work remains. Furthermore, there has been a decrease in the proportion of children under five receiving professional treatment for diarrhea. Although postnatal care data is incomplete, it is evident that care rates remain low nationwide.\n\nCesarean section rates remain lower than expected, at roughly 4%. This statistic highlights another issue: while urban areas report a 7% c-section rate, rural areas see only 2%, indicating inequitable healthcare coverage across the country. Access is primarily concentrated in urban regions. Additionally, vertical equity is a concern, with a 27% disparity in service utilization between the poorest and richest groups, suggesting that financial barriers hinder the poor from accessing healthcare.\n\nIn contemplating the next steps to enhance neonatal and maternal care indicators, the fundamental question is how best to tackle service deficiencies. Should Indonesia focus on specific programmatic initiatives or strengthen the overall health system without emphasizing pre and post-pregnancy care? Program-specific approaches are appealing due to their targeted, manageable objectives and generally quicker results. However, these approaches have significant drawbacks. Investing heavily in one health sector area can lead to reduced funding and resources for others, as seen with international funding for HIV/AIDS affecting the family planning sector. Moreover, running multiple parallel programs leads to redundant and uncoordinated services, resulting in increased paperwork and supply management challenges.",
            "Over the last century, the classification of Popular Music has expanded to such an extent that listing all its genres has become quite challenging. Adding to the complexity, almost all genres—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—have given rise to numerous sub-genres and even sub-sub-genres. Notably, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has emerged as one of the most varied and expressive genres in popular music over the past forty years. It is expressive due to its ability to convey a wide array of emotions, though it often leans towards darker themes. It is also diverse, as people quickly realized the genre's flexibility shortly after its inception, leading them to create their own sub-genres and further subdivide those, continuing the trend to the present day.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal scene has diversified into so many niche groups that pinpointing the exact definition of heavy metal is difficult. It has absorbed numerous elements from other genres, yet, like all things, it originated from somewhere. To truly comprehend the metal music that is prevalent today, one must first grasp what the metal movement entails and why it is considered a movement rather than merely a genre.\n\nIn many respects, metal is a movement characterized by darkness. It's often described as \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more aggression, more theatricality. There's less primitivism and more technical skill, as metal musicians are typically very proficient with their instruments, which is evident in their music. Additionally, metal is, unsurprisingly, a movement heavily influenced by drugs. The psychedelic drug surge in the mid-1970s led to people creating wild, otherworldly records, using drugs as a catalyst for their creativity. It exhibits numerous dark, visceral qualities, a stark contrast to much of the popular music that lacked these darker emotional elements. Later generations of metal have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral aspects that were prominent during the Romantic Era. Lyrics from songs like \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles illustrate this darkness, representing the emotional highs and lows, possibly influenced by drugs. This song is considered by some as one of the early Heavy Metal tracks and was a response to a darker, heavier Rolling Stones song. The Beatles aimed to prove they could match the heaviness of the Stones, so they included it on \"The White Album.\"",
            "Several decades before Surrealist artists started creating their dreamlike imagery, Henri Rousseau was meticulously crafting his own visions, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only depicts a woman marveling at the wonders of a dreamt land but also symbolizes Rousseau's personal ambitions as an artist. From the beginning of his career, he aspired for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from his peers and art enthusiasts, facing a challenging internal conflict to achieve these goals. The Dream best encapsulates Rousseau's lifelong struggle between adhering to or emulating certain artistic styles to gain acceptance in the esteemed art world he admired and maintaining his creative independence and originality.\n\nTo understand The Dream from this angle, it's essential to know some of Rousseau's background. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Henri Rousseau's father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed middle-class prosperity (Shattuck 47). Rousseau did not receive formal art training; instead, he worked for France's municipal toll service until the age of forty, earning the mistaken title of douanier, or customs inspector (Shattuck 46). After losing his first wife, Clémence, and eight of their infant children, Rousseau was left with his daughter, Julia, and profound grief (Shattuck 49). Seeking solace, he turned to painting for comfort and a new beginning. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized peasants in their art, Rousseau was fundamentally a folk painter with the aspirations of an average person from his social class.\n\nRousseau's strong desire for acceptance in the art world is understandable when viewed in context: he lacked formal art education, started his career later in life, and created art alongside many other talented, well-known modern artists. Despite years of work, Rousseau only began receiving proper recognition for his art around the same time Matisse was establishing his artistic reputation. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes that although Rousseau and Matisse were technically competitors, they differed not only in style and subject but also in their motivations for painting: \"Matisse was a painter who feared painting in a clichéd way, while Rousseau aimed to create art so conventional that he would be accepted by the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "Many influential thinkers have suggested a deep link between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. I think there's a fundamental reason for this connection. As John Keats expresses in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” We acquire much of our knowledge through education or experience. Yet, as Keats hints, we seem to understand ethics and aesthetics instinctively, rather than through traditional learning. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than dictate. Our exploration of morality and beauty primarily seeks to explain why a piece of art or a deed is beautiful or moral, instead of providing a checklist for evaluating or creating good art or ethical actions.\n\nMoreover, critiques of art or morals never fully capture the essence of what makes something good or beautiful. Discussions about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on aspects like composition, contrast, or cultural significance, but these don't explain why it's great art. Often, when describing a favorite artwork or literary piece, people say, \"There's just something about it\" before offering a more detailed critique. I believe that neither art nor morals can be entirely reduced to a list of their features. As Flannery O'Connor notes, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” Even with a thorough description of a literary work, something transcendent remains. I think ethics shares this quality. As Wittgenstein states, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.” I propose that this \"something,\" this indefinable quality, is the most potent aspect of art and morality, and it is this transcendent nature that links ethics and aesthetics.\n\nI believe that morality and art are closely connected because we experience both on a level that is felt rather than fully articulated, aligning with Kantian ideas of the noumenal. This connection is even more pronounced with literature. As McKean observes, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Modern Germany is seen as a powerful and unified nation, with a distinct culture stretching from the Alps' shadows in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This cultural uniqueness is also evident from Cologne along the Rhine River, through central Germany, to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. It's no wonder that contemporary Germany is a fusion of various sources and tribes.\n\nThe ancient region known as Germania is the ancestral home of the Germans, though the origin of the name is a topic of debate among scholars and historians. Tacitus suggested that the name derived from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were referred to as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and fought the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first mentioned the term “Germanus” in his account of the Gallic Wars, using it to differentiate between the Gauls he had conquered and the Germanic tribes he had not, borrowing the term from the Gauls themselves. Some believe the name referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter of his initial book on these wars, Caesar noted, “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others argue the name might derive from the spear, known as a ger, used in warfare (O.E.D, 2010), or from the Old Irish word garim, meaning “to shout,” suggesting the Germans were loud or noisy (Names of Germany).\n\nTacitus, an early Roman historian, wrote in AD 98's “De Origine et situ Germanorum” about the German origins, stating, “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive... Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nWhy would anyone leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans at that time. They would occasionally send expeditions into Germania for resources and conduct land campaigns, but they mostly returned to their vast empire. As Germanic tribes began emerging in the mid-first century, they lived on the Roman Empire's borders, trading goods from their lands and serving as soldiers in the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "The play Twelfth Night suggests that while disguise can be effective for prolonged deception, a person must eventually abandon this false identity to avoid losing themselves entirely. However, ending such deception can lead to feelings of alienation. Ultimately, one must choose between self-preservation and maintaining relationships with others. Some may react indifferently to being deceived, but others may take offense at the pretense. Deception involving gender role reversal is especially complex, raising questions about why someone might abandon their identity to adopt that of the opposite gender. In Viola's situation, disguising herself as a man is a means of self-protection: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Newly arrived in an unfamiliar land, Viola finds it necessary to pose as a man to safeguard herself from potential threats. While her plan succeeds, it also isolates her from other women, severing a vital support network. Compounding the issue, Viola is so convincing as a man that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, Viola grapples with unspoken romantic feelings toward Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261). To contemporary readers, Twelfth Night might demonstrate how deception can reveal hidden emotions, particularly for Olivia and Orsino. Some passages suggest that these characters might have unvoiced subconscious desires that Viola/Cesario's presence compels them to confront. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario seems male, or does she secretly have feelings for women? It seems unlikely since Shakespeare's Olivia appears to satirize those who judge others solely on appearance. This is shown by how easily Olivia transfers her affection from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to view Cesario/Viola as family rather than a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "Various observers have highlighted the harshness of German colonial rule, particularly concerning the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, describing an entire colonial empire with such a simplistic view would be misleading. The German colonial empire's policies and governance were as diverse as its geographical expanse. Similarly, educational opportunities varied across the colonies. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a significant number of educated and literate Africans. German efforts in education in Kamerun and other colonies received acclaim from contemporary writers. \n\nIn contrast, the situation in South West Africa (now Namibia) was markedly different. Unlike East Africa, where the government established state schools and actively participated in the education of the natives, in South West Africa, native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies with minimal government support. However, the government did allocate substantial resources for the education of Europeans, creating state schools and providing greater support and regulation for missionary schools. These educational strategies had long-term impacts on South West Africa, persisting even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies had significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to South West Africa's differing experience. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors and highlight new research on settlers' and colonial authorities' attitudes towards native Africans.\n\nThere is extensive literature focused specifically on education within the German colonial empire. Most of these works, written in German, date back to the early twentieth century, during or shortly after German colonial rule. The initial aim of these writings was mainly to detail the educational systems in these colonies. Later English-language studies expanded the discussion through comparative analyses of education across different German colonies and more in-depth examinations of specific educational aspects. These studies revealed significant disparities in the educational systems among the colonies. The most notable work directly addressing the topic of this paper is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and explores the factors behind their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa accounts for many of the unique features of its educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonies, South West Africa had a relatively moderate climate, despite much of its territory being arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans resided in South West Africa, while the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa, had only 5,336.",
            "The United States and Mexico once experienced a prolonged rivalry that lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The peak of this conflict was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, acquiring Texas and the American Southwest. Numerous other conflicts occurred between the two countries, eventually diminishing just before World War I. This rivalry was rooted in clashes over significant issues such as religion, culture, tradition, and material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31). \n\nSimilar to many other nations with enduring rivalries, countries sharing borders often have conflicting interests leading to rivalries. The United States and Mexico exemplify this common pattern among neighboring nations. According to David M. Pletcher (1977), \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). These two countries, due to their proximity, have been historical rivals of the United States, whereas other Latin American countries have generally maintained good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences were a significant source of tension between the two nations, a challenge faced by many countries throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). Unlike the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was partly ideological, the U.S.-Mexico tensions were more about religious preferences. This distrust originated from the historical animosity between the English and Spanish, which complicated the establishment of friendly relations between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identify 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry period, mostly involving territorial issues such as border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier problems. Bandit raids from American border towns persisted until both countries applied military force along their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). According to Schmitt (1974), the rivalry began to subside as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and concluded as American goals shifted \"from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p.110) in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was unexpectedly struck by an illness that left me disabled, one I had never heard of before. At that time, I was working as a nurse. I chose nursing because I had a deep-seated need for the safety and security I lacked during my childhood. I often heard the saying, \"You'll always have a job because people will always get sick,\" as I grew up. Despite my dreams of becoming a scientist or a journalist—or perhaps both—I pursued a career in nursing.\n\nHowever, at 46, I found myself single, with no substantial savings, and unable to work. I remain disabled and after 15 years relying on Social Security Disability, I have virtually nothing to call my own. I manage to get by, but each day is a challenge that threatens my security, safety, and self-esteem. While nothing in my life feels certain now, I do know one thing: I couldn't have survived all these years without the support of my family and a few good friends, no matter how strong I thought I was. When true disaster hits, strength feels elusive.\n\nThe truth is, life is full of emergencies, both big and small. There are no guarantees, and some challenges are too overwhelming to handle alone, regardless of how prepared one might be. I completely agree that in the U.S., we need to stop relying solely on the government, which is clearly faltering. Instead, I would prefer to see Americans learning to trust and help one another again, rather than each of us building individual fallout shelters.\n\nConservatives in the U.S. often speak about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country; however, it was actually compassion, mutual respect, and resource-sharing that sustained our forefathers during tough times. The pioneers who traveled across the Rockies in wagon trains didn't reach the West Coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, absolutely, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting with duct tape for the windows in case of a biological attack. I also have various flashlights, plenty of batteries, numerous candles, waterproof matches, and canned food. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and can preserve your own food, do it. It's a great idea, as is having a wood stove, provided you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're preparing, take the time to get to know your neighbors.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he gave up worldly pursuits, attained enlightenment, and his teachings eventually gave rise to Buddhism. The most traditional branch of this religion is called Theravada Buddhism. Buddhism is approximately 2,500 years old, and it has evolved since the time of Buddha. This evolution is evident in various places, such as Sri Lanka, a Theravada Buddhist nation, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is held. Both monks and laypeople engage in this ceremony, which holds some religious importance, even though Buddha never mentioned such festivities. These changes are evident in the superficial practices and the fundamental beliefs of the religion. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community, including both monastics and laypersons, has had to adapt its doctrinal principles due to various influences, both from within and outside the community, and both beneficial and detrimental.\n\nSeveral key terms will be frequently used in this discussion. There is the distinction between internal and external forces. An internal force arises from members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of whether they are monastics. An external force originates from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is one that harms or intends to harm the Buddhist community, stemming from a negative view of Buddhism. A benign force neither aims to help nor harm the community, though it might inadvertently do either. These terms will be referenced often throughout the discussion.\n\nTo begin, it's important to explore the fundamental aspects of the religion—the core doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma primarily consists of the Tripitaka, or the \"three baskets,\" of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka includes the rules of discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. The metaphysical ideas include Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (the inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (the impermanence of everything). Understanding these concepts is essential to end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which occurs continuously. With the end of Sansara, one also ends lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) upon achieving enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for living. Laypeople follow five precepts: abstaining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and taking intoxicants. Monks follow many more disciplinary rules. The most fundamental doctrinal concept in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. The first is Dukkha, the truth that life is suffering. The second is that attachment causes suffering. The third is that suffering can be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.

            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture is a crucial factor in negotiations. It can be understood not only by its characteristics but also by what it is not and what it represents. Culture is diverse and not a single, uniform entity. Generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are overly simplistic and broad. While grasping cultural generalizations is useful, it is more beneficial for a negotiator to comprehend the relevance of a culture to the negotiation and how its attitudes may influence discussions. When encountering a foreign culture, one tends to relate it to their own, leading to comparisons.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset might involve anything from exploring its history to recognizing its biases. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, one should accept it as it is and operate within its framework, especially in negotiations, and particularly if one is at a disadvantage. Moreover, when negotiating in unfamiliar territory, respecting traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and advance the negotiation.\n\nIt's important to remember that culture extends beyond national or international divides. Companies often develop their own corporate culture, which may prioritize long work hours or a more relaxed approach. Corporate culture is visible in employee dress codes, communication styles (direct vs. indirect), delegation of tasks, and hiring practices. Some companies support philanthropy at any employee level, while others limit it to approved charities or fundraisers. The diversity within American corporate culture, varying from company to company and even within regions, highlights the variety of thought within a societal culture. While some cultures may seem less stratified than American culture and appear more uniform, this is just a cue to explore deeper.\n\nUnderstanding values is even more crucial because they explain the reasons behind a culture's behavior. If a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superior to succeed. Similarly, a negotiator from a culture that prioritizes tough bargaining won't be quick to settle. Considering these generalities is essential before negotiations begin. However, it is beneficial for a negotiator to learn about their counterpart on a personal level to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "The phrase \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” originates in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is used by St. Anselm in his argument about God's existence. This belief is shared by Thomas Aquinas, another thinker we will examine. Since both authors argue in favor of the same idea, our task is to determine whose argument is superior. For conciseness, we will assume that they both believe in the existence of the God depicted in the Bible. Considering a different concept of God would hinder a fair comparison of their arguments, as both defend a specific notion of God. However, it seems neither author provides a comprehensive foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo explore this, we first look at St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm's perspective involves understanding through faith, suggesting that proof of God is found within oneself. He argues that since God exists in our understanding, we cannot truly imagine his nonexistence. Although his explanation can be complex and unclear, the main idea is that God's existence is confirmed by reflecting on what we inherently know to be true in our minds, without needing external evidence. This acceptance of beliefs without empirical proof is commonly called faith in Christian texts.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, on the other hand, proposes that God's existence can be established entirely through reason and empirical evidence, without the need for faith. This approach would be advantageous for evangelism, a key aspect of Christianity, as it allows for persuading new converts through logic alone. Aquinas outlines five logical arguments proving God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each, he shows that God's existence is a logical necessity. Just as you can deduce the features and existence of a missing puzzle piece by assembling the rest, you can use logic to infer the necessity of God.",
            "Authors often employ various techniques to evoke specific emotions or attitudes in their readers regarding significant topics. Some techniques are more successful than others. In his novel The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes a range of these methods. One approach involves pairing an adjective with a noun in an unconventional way to create a particular atmosphere around a subject. Another technique is assigning meaning to a symbol and using it to achieve the same effect. Fitzgerald notably employs this latter technique with colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, he assigns specific meanings to colors like white/gray and red/pink, later using these meanings to evoke certain feelings associated with important objects.\n\nFitzgerald establishes and employs the meaning of white/gray to represent uniformity, with white suggesting a higher class and gray symbolizing something older and faded. He introduces this meaning early in the novel through frequent use. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are often depicted \"in white\" (8); indeed, many characters wear white: Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only exception is when Nick observes Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further solidifies these colors by applying them to mundane subjects: Nick descends \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), guest names at Gatsby's parties are listed as \"gray names\" (61), and Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—signifying uniformity (28). He also uses white and gray to describe ordinary people or places: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" by the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald establishes enough meaning for white/gray, he uses them to denote unimportance or uniformity in certain subjects, beginning with Daisy. After a period of little use of these colors, Daisy is described as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" prompting readers to perceive her as less of a distinct character and more as a uniform addition, something Gatsby desires (74). Fitzgerald continues this portrayal of Daisy as an element of uniformity, for example, in the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18), and again in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County boasts significant agricultural productivity due to its mild and sunny climate. It commonly produces crops such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a notable demand for organic community-supported agriculture in the San Diego region, with many local groups experiencing long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Numerous organic farms offer tours of their agricultural practices and provide opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This type of operation allows landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitats, thus enabling recreational use and offering farm tours and educational programs as sources of income.\n\nIn addition to tapping into a potentially profitable niche market, organic farming often results in increased biodiversity among plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming can be more costly than conventional farming in certain respects. It demands more intensive labor and management for pest and weed control and soil fertilization without chemicals, and losses can be higher compared to conventional methods. Small organic farms also lack the efficiency of scale enjoyed by larger operations. Practices beneficial to wildlife, although not directly related to organic farming, may also increase labor expenses, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, removing invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create specific conditions like edge habitats or open ground patches. Therefore, the landowner in this scenario may seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land selected for this example is a 160-acre parcel near Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It consists of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. It is located in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which is still under review but currently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many of these species are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, while others like burrowing owls are declining and may soon be listed.\n\nThis area was home to Native Americans for countless centuries before cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers settled it in the late 1800s. The land was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing and/or wood production over many decades. I chose a property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to explore the realistic options a small farmer might have for reducing costs and maintaining wildlife-friendly operations. As a model of what someone farming this land might aim to achieve, I identified an organic farm in the same area.",
            "There exists an unbreakable and undeniable connection between brothers, filled with a multitude of emotions such as love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. This unique bond allows brothers to understand each other more deeply than anyone else could, seeing themselves reflected in one another. It is during the most critical moments that the true essence of this bond is revealed, whether for better or worse. When these emotions surface, they come at a significant cost. Understanding the feelings that arise from this fraternal connection involves dealing with the consequences they bring. Looking into a brother's eyes and seeing one's own reflection allows a person to see themselves not as others do, but as they truly are. Their true character is revealed through their actions and the repercussions of those actions. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers explore this theme, along with the intense emotions it involves. Against a richly detailed backdrop, these boys embark on a hopeless journey. In the climactic scene, bitter disappointment collides with intense pride, and only one brother survives. The theme is conveyed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which expresses the complex emotions felt by the protagonist and his view of the surrounding world, both of which greatly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by one key emotion: pride. From his first outing with his younger brother, Doodle, to their final, tragic adventure, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He had envisioned a brother he could teach skills like \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He desired a brother to \"race to Horsehead Landing... and perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn...\" These aspirations were clearly unattainable due to Doodle's condition. Doodle was born with a frail heart, making his survival uncertain, let alone his participation in strenuous activities. This was a devastating blow to the young protagonist, who had filled his head with dreams that were shattered instantly. He even felt anger towards the fragile child, once contemplating suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would consider such a drastic action? Yet, his resolve softened when Doodle smiled at him, a simple gesture that filled the protagonist with hope, indicating that his murderous intention was not deeply rooted. Deep down, he instinctively loved his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex and innovative system for processing information. As technology progressed from basic to sophisticated, so did the metaphors used to describe the brain. Initially likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, a book, and more recently, a computer, these comparisons are useful but have limitations and can lead to incorrect assumptions.  \nInformation processing begins with sensory organs receiving input, converting physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound, and light into electrochemical signals. The brain's algorithms transform this sensory information through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing compiles basic details like color, orientation, and border delineation—where color changes abruptly—to recognize the box. Top-down processing then leverages decisions from the bottom-up process to accelerate recognition, helping to identify the object as a black box rather than a hole in the white background.  \nOnce processed to a certain extent, an attention filter assesses the signal's significance and determines which cognitive processes should access it. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when looking at your shoes, a functional attention filter prevents individual recognition. Conversely, you might notice your name spoken in a noisy room. Processing occurs in multiple stages, with attention continually influencing the outcomes.  \nFor the brain to process information, it first needs storage. This involves several types of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded, with specific encoding types for each sensory input. For instance, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically. Once stored, information must be maintained. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which holds information for about 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal cycling through a series of neurons briefly. Long-term memory is thought to be maintained by the structure of certain proteins.  \nThere are various models of how the brain organizes knowledge, some based on human memory retrieval, others on computer science, and still others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, interconnected based on their relatedness. For instance, in a semantic network, “chair” might connect to “table,” which in turn connects to “wooden,” and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States was hit by a devastating financial crisis. Unemployment rose, the housing market collapsed, and several key American corporations faced severe damage. This recession continues today, prompting us to ask: what caused this crisis, and how can we prevent it? Essentially, the financial turmoil resulted from shortsighted and self-serving political choices that coerced banks and companies into approving sub-prime loans within an already fragile financial system. At the same time, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were urged to endorse and repackage these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves and shifted the resulting turmoil onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold, impacting the broader economy.\n\nThe crisis traces back to 1999 during the Clinton administration, as the President aimed to secure a second term by boosting his popularity. To achieve this, the Clinton administration loosened lending regulations, inadvertently setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. In 1999, Steven Holmes from the New York Times noted, “Fannie Mae, the nation’s largest underwriter of home mortgages, has faced growing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income individuals and felt compelled by stockholders to sustain its extraordinary profit growth.” Holmes accurately predicted the outcome of these actions: “But the government-backed corporation could encounter difficulties during an economic downturn, leading to a government bailout similar to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.” As outlined earlier, and as Holmes anticipated, reckless lending would inevitably result in economic collapse.\n\nNumerous elements contributed to the economic downturn, including the new and intricate mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were heavily utilized in the years before the crisis, further entangling more economic sectors with the housing market. This led U.S. households and financial markets overall to excessively invest in the housing market, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities suffered. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, accounting for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. Ultimately, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at remarkably low prices, Lehman Brothers was disbanded, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to become commercial banks subject to stringent regulations. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac held $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That part of your story where you can spread your wings as a writer and captivate everyone with your enchanting prose. Or, conversely, the section where readers might doze off or click away, cursing your name. Dr. Merlin has been known to yell at her screen when she's bombarded with an overload of information, and not even in an enjoyable way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy gentle readers are already familiar with the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself in lengthy segments of text where either nothing occurs or too much does. Exposition is like the little devil on your shoulder suggesting you get the history out of the way to reach the exciting parts (not to be confused with the devil on the other shoulder urging you to share every single detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition involves telling the audience what happened, usually in straightforward prose. In film, exposition occurs when one character dumps a load of information onto another, much like \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nAn example is needed. As you read a story, you learn that the heroine met her beloved at a specific place and time, that they had a grand wedding, and that her husband was murdered before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to be covered in just two pages, with only two lines of dialogue each for him and her. You would anticipate the author taking time to develop the husband's character, showing through his words and actions how deeply he loves his wife. Similarly, you would expect the heroine to demonstrate, in various ways, how his presence transformed and enriched her life (especially if the story later explicitly states this). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally invested in his fate and provide insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, the depth of their connection, hints about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as seen through his eyes, and so forth. You would mourn his death with her, thereby growing more attached to the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you would expect more substance to the simple plot line: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that substance. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, continues*) It's sometimes tempting to gloss over certain details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he was in the Air Force, he's now the night manager of a gas station, has been married twice with no kids, enjoys fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one, which was live, aired on NBC 4 on the morning of August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man named Shad Hostettler in Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife, though her name was not mentioned. They showed his mugshot, describing him as looking malevolent. This developing story was covered briefly, lasting only about two minutes. The details provided were that he had stabbed her several times and was arrested. I felt this was an appropriate amount of coverage for the situation.\n\nThe second story was about an early morning shooting involving an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers, who was critically injured in the Sharon Woods area. At the time, no arrests had been made, and there were no suspects, though the SWAT Team was investigating. This story was also short, which I suspect might be because the victim was a Black man or because it occurred in a predominantly Black neighborhood. I've noticed over the years that crimes involving minority victims often receive less attention in the media compared to similar incidents involving white individuals.\n\nAnother story covered was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were provided about where it might have happened, and it was determined that the helicopter had been hit by a .22 caliber rifle bullet. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThe newscast also mentioned the forecast of rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with weekend temperatures expected to remain in the mid to low eighties. The weather segment was brief, likely used as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nAnother report focused on a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned Black man wearing a hoodie, approximately six feet tall and weighing about 150 pounds. I found it unusual how much emphasis was placed on his race and skin tone.\n\nLastly, there was a story about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin from Texas, found guilty of conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana to Ohio. Interestingly, instead of stating his sentence as 25 years, they said \"300 months,\" which might have been intended to sound harsher. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, which I felt was irrelevant to the story.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of security that aims to mirror the performance of an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund. However, it offers greater flexibility because it trades like a stock on an exchange. This type of fund provides the diversification benefits of an index fund while offering advantages akin to owning individual stocks, such as the ability to sell short, purchase on margin, and buy as little as one share per transaction. Despite these appealing features, ETFs typically have much lower expense ratios than the average mutual fund. However, there are drawbacks, such as the requirement to pay a commission on any ETF trade, similar to stock transactions. Another advantage of ETFs is the broad range of available funds. It is important for astute financial investors to assess whether the proclaimed benefits, like diversification, truly exist and to what degree. In this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to determine if owning a single ETF offers similar benefits to owning a diversified portfolio of these ten stocks, and whether alternative configurations of these stocks could yield a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo assess the ETF, we will focus only on the top ten holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets, rather than every holding. Listed below are these top 10 holdings and their percentage of total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these ten stocks reflect the overall ETF IHF, we can use their current percentage of assets, standardized to 100%, to calculate their contributions to a portfolio’s Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consists solely of these 10 stocks in the proportions established by the ETF's holdings. The calculated Beta and return are shown in the chart below.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings yields a return that is 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. It also indicates that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than that of the entire ETF. Thus far, the analysis suggests that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings might offer higher returns with lower beta. However, it is possible that the average outcomes of these two portfolios are not statistically different from each other. To determine if these portfolios are statistically distinct, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is calculated and normalized to 100% to compare their combined standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Referring to Figure 17, there was a sharp decline in the number of commuter log submissions during the project's third month. This was somewhat disappointing, and the reasons for this decrease are not entirely clear. The arrival of winter at a New England campus likely led to fewer people commuting by bicycle or on foot, which could explain part of the reduction. December also coincides with the conclusion of the fall semester, a time when everyone is preoccupied with completing schoolwork, grading, and related tasks, possibly causing the commuter log to be overlooked. Moreover, the busy holiday season begins in December, bringing a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many do not need to visit campus. Classes resume for the spring semester in late January, potentially contributing to the low log submissions during that month. However, this does not fully account for the low submissions in February. It's possible that projects like this experience an initial surge of enthusiasm that later wanes. To counteract this trend, we organized Carpool Challenge Week, a special campaign in March to revitalize the initiative, which successfully increased log submissions for that month. Maintaining project momentum was challenging due to both a natural decline in engagement and the specific issues of holiday and semester breaks typical in higher education. \n\nAnother challenge for this project, as with any alternative commuting initiative, is that people value the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars, which is deeply ingrained in our culture. Therefore, it's crucial to offer incentives for alternative commuting methods. We distributed numerous prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see how even larger prizes might have impacted participation, such as offering a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This might have helped counteract the drop in engagement the project faced. The nature of the prizes remained consistent throughout the project. However, increasing the value of the prizes over time might have been beneficial. While the gift cards were sufficient at the project's start, announcing additional incentives like bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January could have potentially boosted participation and engagement, rather than seeing a decline.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all fifteen trick films made between 1895 and 1901. These films typically utilize creative editing to create illusions. My analysis primarily focused on describing the artistic elements of most trick films and identifying unique evolutionary traits in a few of the later ones. Generally, trick films from the turn of the century were confined to a set, shot within a frontal proscenium, lacked camera movement, employed long and medium shots, and followed a strict one shot equals one film approach. However, some films from the early 1900s began to challenge these norms by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA prominent feature shared by these trick films is the use of an interior set framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, not tracking any movement of figures or objects. This style was typical of early films, influenced by theatrical traditions and, specifically for trick films, vaudeville and magic performances. One limitation of this stage-based approach is that characters in trick films mainly move side-to-side, without approaching or retreating from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move horizontally. Even when they exit the frame, the camera stays in place.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition also results in mostly long shots, with medium shots being less common, and no close-ups appearing in any of the Edison trick films. This mirrors the theatre and vaudeville conventions, where audiences saw the entire performance framed by the stage boundaries. As with most early films, actors do not move towards the camera from the middle ground, so close-ups are absent.\n\nTypically, early trick films follow the principle that a single conceptual shot constitutes a whole film. This restricts the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frame rate used, and limits their dramatic or narrative potential; they mainly focus on short vaudeville-like tricks, such as magic or disappearing acts, with minimal story. However, in trick films, a conceptual shot perceived by the viewer doesn’t necessarily mean a single physical shot. A “shot” might actually comprise several edited together to create illusions of appearance or disappearance. For example, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a closer examination reveals the transition to the shot with Mary's severed \"head,\" even though the entire film is perceived as one continuous shot by the viewer.",
            "The classic \"Gothic Novel\" is, as Ian Watt points out in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, an oxymoron signifying \"Old-New.\" This literary style has been both criticized and praised, accused of lacking depth, and admired for its ability to evoke a 'terrible sublime' (Burke). Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the first \"Gothic Novel,\" combined elements from both \"ancient and modern\" romances to forge the proto-Gothic genre and a new way of literary expression. Walpole incorporated \"old\" theatrical traditions with 'new' natural mimicry from 'modern' novels to create what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre extensively references medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and customs. Even during the publication of The Castle of Otranto, \"gothic\" described various peoples, styles, and eras, often seen as outdated or crude compared to \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The blend of theatrical \"Gothic\" with the novel's new format, which offered readers a more intimate glimpse into characters' psychology, has enabled the Gothic to endure over time, being simultaneously obsolete and fresh to readers far removed from its inception.\n\nA key gothic theme in Gothic novels is the idea of Chivalry. In The Castle of Otranto, the medieval concept of chivalry—the training of a proper knight—is both preserved and transformed. Chivalry holds significant appeal for Gothic authors because it symbolizes the classic knight, brave, honorable, and capable, and the perceived absence of such ideals in society, as seen by writers like Walpole. By employing chivalric ideals and manners, the \"gothic past\" becomes idealized and romanticized (foreshadowing the Gothic's evolution into Romantic) and is used to critique and potentially enhance the present. When writing The Castle of Otranto, Walpole was amidst political turmoil and despondent about the future. Immersed in politics and possibly facing unjust accusations, he might have, even if subconsciously, felt that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" of the gothic era had been lost in contemporary society. This sentiment is evident in his characters, such as Frederic. Before meeting Frederic, readers learn he embodies many chivalric traits; he is depicted as:\n\nFrederic's description is filled with traditional chivalric imagery; he is primarily a prince, who has endured suffering, been properly affected by tragedy, left his home, and is believed to have been slain by infidels. The portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, introducing the Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the sequence of actions required to transfer goods from a customer's order through the stages of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution until they reach the customer. The concept of supply chain management was introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver. He explained the comprehensive process of planning, executing, and overseeing supply chain activities to meet customer needs promptly and efficiently. The six essential components of a supply chain are production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nThe initial step in the supply chain process is production, which serves as the basis for the entire system. This stage involves determining the timing, reasoning, location, and methodology for production. Managers must understand customer preferences, which can be gauged by examining the market. The market is a primary indicator of customer demands. Once managers have assessed the market and comprehend customer needs, they can decide on the products to be manufactured and their quantities. After these decisions, they choose the most suitable production site, considering factors like volume and quality while ensuring customer demands and satisfaction are met. Following the selection of a production location, managers concentrate on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Production is a critical phase in the supply chain, where attention to detail is crucial, as inadequate planning can result in significant time and financial losses for the company. For instance, in my experience at Wal-Mart and Target, both companies had structured guidelines and processes for various business aspects, including employee uniforms and shipment receipt. Clearly defined processes enable smooth operation without confusion about direction and expectations.\n\nThe second crucial component of supply chain management is supply. Supply involves making strategic decisions to determine a facility’s core capabilities, which subsequently guide the development of outsourcing partnerships. A company might have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with distinct equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers need to identify which division is best suited for different stages of production. They might also opt to outsource work to other companies, primarily to achieve velocity. Velocity refers to the capacity to deliver quality and flexibility while simultaneously reducing or maintaining low costs.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the era. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights are considered Victorian novels that deviate from this norm. These two works incorporate elements of mystery and a penchant for the unusual, which are not typical of the period's literature, thereby enhancing the characters and providing deeper insights into their motives and emotions.\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of firearms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nBoth novels frequently use mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the content and purpose differ in each case. In Oliver Twist, these strange events often reveal insights into Oliver’s inner struggles, his pain, and his awareness of the true nature of the events around him. When Oliver's shooting is revisited in chapter 28, he experiences the event as if in a vivid dream, struggling to find help. The passage highlights Oliver’s lack of control over unfolding events and the severe state of his health, as emphasized by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing his senses so much that he fails to notice the \"unseen hand\" that carries him away; he relives his despair, now intertwined with constant pain and fear rather than surprise. This raises the question of who is responsible for his misfortune, as it was clearly not his own doing. The shooting underscores Oliver's lack of control, showing that he cannot even attempt to alter the outcome of events, even when his life is at stake. This passage suggests a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, compelling him to accept this despair and affecting his ability to respond. Otherwise, it could be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least to save his own life.\n\n\"The day passed off—day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come—and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years back, I was involved in an after-school program where I tutored elementary students. I tried my best to assist them in any subject they found challenging, although my expertise was in English and reading. An instructor asked me to help a young boy named Adrian, likely in third or fourth grade, who was facing significant difficulties with reading. I noticed something unusual; he had inconsistent issues with letter pronunciation—some he nailed perfectly, while others were completely off. Adrian was clearly of Latino descent, yet he spoke flawless English. We struggled until one day I met his mother. I was looking after a few students left behind while the rest went on a field trip when she came in. She didn't speak English, only Spanish. Despite my limited Spanish skills, we managed to understand each other. It then struck me: Adrian was proficient in reading but wasn't well-versed in the English alphabet. I can't say for sure if this realization helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, particularly in California. It also illustrates that these challenges aren't always apparent. Even a child fluent in spoken English can face significant hurdles in reading. We all recognize this problem, but what's the solution? In Adrian's situation, the fix was straightforward: focused tutoring in English reading, especially on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children with limited English skills, the solution is more complex. There's no single answer. A combination of dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes is essential.\n\nTo begin, the dual language system is a promising approach, beneficial not just for Spanish-speaking children but for all. Research shows that children in bilingual programs often outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns that such programs might squander resources or benefit only a few, this is untrue. If these programs became standard rather than exceptions, all students would gain. But how do we implement this? Demanding all teachers to be bilingual isn't practical. Nevertheless, there's no reason we can't employ bilingual aides or tutors.",
            "From a young age, many of us are taught that there exists something greater than ourselves, something beyond our comprehension. Some of us attend Sunday school to learn about it, others go to Temple, or seek answers within. Many easily accept the religions passed down by our parents, while others reject them entirely, believing nothing exists beyond their personal, self-centered world. We might embrace one set of beliefs only to later adopt another. Regardless of the path we take, we strive to understand ourselves through our own spiritual perspectives, seeking a guiding light to lead us from darkness to light.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father replied when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on our front porch, listening to the rain on the tin roof while we smoked. The gutters overflowed, soaking the plants by the porch. My father stared into the rain, a gaze that seemed both searching and remembering. He had become thinner, his clothes hanging loosely, and his hair was sparser than I remembered. He continued to look into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt isolated, frightened, unable to express how much I would miss him, fearing that speaking about it would make it more real. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer to his, and joined him in watching the June twilight rain.\n\nMy father passed away that December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation only prolonged his suffering beyond the doctors’ expectations, providing no comfort. I questioned the kind of God who would allow this. Alone at night, I offered no prayers, thinking if God existed, He had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI didn’t want to witness his transition from this life to another, so I didn’t. I couldn’t watch the life that created me come to an end. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father wouldn’t want his only child to witness his death. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and fervent supporter of Republicanism. Though he was mainly a farmer, his profession and brief political career made him known for his commitment and outspoken views on personal freedom and governance. His belief in an agrarian system formed the foundation of nearly all his governmental opinions. His efforts to uphold and promote what he saw as the noblest profession shaped his views on sovereignty, constitutionality, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a unique chance to establish an ideal system, as there was no existing tradition to constrain the government’s founders, enabling the creation of a self-governing system. He was a strong advocate for natural rights and believed they were interlinked—if one right is denied, all will fail, diminishing the value of the remaining rights. Therefore, these rights should be protected from government interference. He argued that in the so-called \"state of nature,\" those with physical strength and cunning intelligence thrived, but this should not be the case in a civilized society.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor argued for a government that acknowledges the inherent good and evil within humans. He held firm views on dualistic morality, stating, “As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human” (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalism, believing a government based on such principles would function fairly regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by greed and self-interest. Taylor saw self-interest as a universal motivator but considered it only evil when it led to the formation of sub-societies that thrived at others’ expense. A good government was essential to restrain man's inherent evil, requiring constant vigilance to prevent the incorporation of harmful principles.\n\nLike many committed Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a highly limited Federal government, permitting only the rights and powers explicitly stated in the Constitution. He recognized that a large Federal government was costly and likely to become tyrannical. However, he believed that a straightforward, literal interpretation could be perilous, as it could easily become corrupt without considering the writers’ intentions. Furthermore, he viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true foundation of the United States, as it more clearly defined the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind trying to take in the view without attaching any deeper meaning to it. With a calm detachment and a practiced eye, I examined the scene before me, my thoughts fleeting in and out so quickly that it felt as if I wasn't really thinking, just experiencing the sight fluidly. \n\nOnce, following a suggestion from an artist I knew, I bought a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had longed to learn drawing since I was six, and this book covered everything from understanding a pencil to how the brain interprets lines. One method it taught was to use a square frame to focus on any picture, simplifying a complex scene—like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room—into a more manageable image, just the fruit on a simple surface.\n\nAt that moment, staring at the bowl before me, I couldn't mentally apply the artist’s frame. I was too overwhelmed, too struck with awe, only able to stand and marvel. Picasso had his blue period, Monet adored greenery, and the Italian Renaissance masters reveled in a spectrum of colors. If I fancied my viewpoint to be worthy of the title \"Artistic,\" then the scene before me was the inception of my piece, my story, Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers touched my chosen tool of creativity, muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand moved, my mind's intent taking shape in what might have been my most creative moment. Water swirled, calm and clear, as particles broke away and disappeared. Muscles tightened, jerking more anxiously the second time as my hand hit the toilet handle again. The stubborn brown mass remained, stuck like a slug at the toilet’s bottom.\n\nHolding the mop loosely, feet apart, and my green tie uncomfortably tight, I frowned at the unpleasant bundle of processed matter left as a message for the unlucky ones cleaning the Rite Aid bathrooms. Several more flushes, a few more calm moments of introspection, then my hand reached for the toilet paper, wrapping itself until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing upright, then bending at the waist, my hand slowly dipped into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Teen fatalities in car accidents are a growing concern. Various factors contribute to this alarming trend among the youngest drivers in America. According to the National Institutes of Health, one issue is that teenagers' brains are not fully developed to handle the dangers of driving. Additionally, their lack of experience greatly contributes to the problem, leading to more fatal crashes, increased instances of rollovers, speeding, and veering off the road. Teenagers are particularly at risk when driving with peers, a common occurrence. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a link between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents. \n\nTo address this, California and other states have introduced provisional licenses that limit driving hours and restrict other minors from being passengers. However, these measures are temporary solutions. The fundamental problem is that young drivers, as a group, are statistically unable to manage driving risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman suggests that even at 18, individuals may be too young for a standard driver's license. His research, cited by USA Today, indicates that people under 19-20 often seek risky experiences for excitement. It would be logical to postpone driving until this thrill-seeking tendency diminishes. Issuing licenses to young teens could lead to even more deadly accidents, potentially increasing fatalities as more Baby Boomer offspring become eligible to drive by 2010.\n\nLegislation to address this could be relatively simple. Schools could continue offering driver's education to prepare future drivers, but no one under 18 should drive. A provisional permit could still be issued before a full license, requiring a set number of driving hours, similar to existing state requirements (such as California's six hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours with an adult). Since teen driving fatalities are a nationwide issue, uniform national legislation would be an effective way to safeguard teenagers across the country. This proposal is not a new concept.",
            "This document explores three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with a concise definition of the disorder, followed by an explanation of the diagnosis process, highlighting common characteristics or \"red flags.\" The paper concludes by discussing how teachers in mainstream classrooms can support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), pertains to how efficiently and effectively the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. More specifically, (C)AP involves the CNS's perceptual processing of auditory information and the neurobiological activity that supports this processing, which results in electrophysiologic auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it is a disorder where the brain struggles to process auditory inputs correctly. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally and are not considered \"hearing impaired\"; rather, the brain area responsible for interpreting auditory information, such as distinguishing words or separating conversation from background noise, does not function as expected.\n\nThe earliest reference to what is now known as CAPD dates back to the mid-1950s under the term \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), during research on children with communication disorders. The Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954. In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and developed a model to explain the physiology of the central auditory nervous system (CANS) related to dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 sparked further research into CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways: individuals may struggle to locate or perceive sound spatially, have difficulty distinguishing between multiple sounds, fail to recognize sound patterns, or be unable to detect changes in speech tone (such as sarcasm). Sounds may be masked by subsequent sounds, there may be an inability to synthesize auditory clues meaningfully, and there might be difficulty identifying the sequence of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves screening through \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,\" which can be conducted by audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and other professionals using various measures to assess auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires, surveys, and observations of auditory behaviors, such as the patient's responses to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single tool or test with consistently high diagnostic success, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Many tests present the patient with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and require them to differentiate certain items, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the corresponding responses.",
            "In my pursuit of a social work education, my goal is to build a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on assisting children who have experienced abuse or neglect and offering support to families in distress. The values I bring to the field of social work include service, respect, ethical conduct, a commitment to enhancing relationships, and a dedication to my own professional development to ensure competence in my field. These principles are not only vital to social workers but also personally significant to me.\n\nI have always wanted to help others, though I was initially uncertain about which career path to choose. During my high school and college years, I observed many people avoiding their issues or adopting inadequate coping strategies. These experiences motivated me to earn a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Still unsure of my career direction, I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, a visit to a friend introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy seeking refuge from abusive parents. The next day, when he contacted the police regarding his home situation, I visited his parents' house to see if I could assist. I shared my concerns with the police, mentioning my recent psychology degree, and they asked me to speak with the parents since legal action could not be taken for the teenager. In questioning the parents, they appeared anxious and offered excuses, describing their son's actions as manipulative in involving outsiders for what they called \"simple\" family disputes. This experience made me seriously consider a career in social work to assist children facing \"simple\" family conflicts.\n\nSocial justice is another crucial value in social work. While society professes the importance of the individual and mourns those we lose, it often values conformity over genuine individuality. If society truly values the individual, why do we strive to be like everyone else? I consider myself an individual and resist conforming to societal norms. Throughout high school and college, I opposed social injustice through various means, such as dyeing my hair unconventional colors, wearing clothes that reflected my personality, getting multiple ear piercings, participating in GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and standing against racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. I am committed to social justice and will continue to challenge social injustices.",
            "This paper examines the Biological and Sociocultural models as they pertain to insomnia. The biological model emphasizes inherited genetic traits and medical health factors. In contrast, the Sociocultural model considers environmental interactions and their relevance to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The review analyzes research on insomnia, clarifying how each study relates to and enhances the understanding of these models, while also assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the findings.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified as primary disorders, those linked to another mental disorder, or those associated with other conditions. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, whereas disorders related to mental health are connected to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorders might arise from medical issues or substance use. Dyssomnias comprise Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves challenges in achieving or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia involves difficulty staying awake, both persisting for at least a month. Narcolepsy is characterized by cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. While Dyssomnias focus on sleep onset and maintenance, Parasomnias involve behavioral or physiological abnormalities during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Disorders linked to other mental health issues involve sleep disturbances caused by Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Intellectual Disabilities). This review centers on insomnia, with a partial focus on primary sleep disorders, in relation to biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genetic, hereditary, and physiological aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus that contain orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. Research on mice demonstrated that GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are crucial for sleep/wake regulation. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, and inhibiting it may reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist baclofen was shown to increase sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that results from animal studies may be applicable to humans, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. Issues with this receptor could impair sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if such a phenotype is inherited, it could disrupt sleep naturally, adversely affecting areas like education, employment, and daily tasks requiring concentration.",
            "I have been attending University Park for approximately two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many students, myself included. During my freshman year, I was assigned a dorm room in East Halls, which is nearly at the easternmost edge of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my residence at Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes, especially during the frequent inclement weather in State College. An alum, not much older than me, shared that in the past, East Halls were separated from the rest of the university by vast stretches of unused land. Nowadays, that space has been developed with sports fields, large new buildings such as the new Creamery and health services building, and is surrounded by apartments. As our campus continues to grow, moving around becomes increasingly difficult. What is the best way to tackle this mobility issue? On a college campus, it's the bicycle. However, simply having bikes isn't enough. Students need to use them, and the campus infrastructure must cater to cyclists' needs.\n\nI recently spoke to a friend who started cycling again after several years. He remarked that he wondered why he ever stopped, saying, “Bikes are great. For a while, it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” Besides being beneficial for health, cycling is the most efficient mode of transport. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many other undergraduates, I now live off-campus, at a distance comparable to some dorms from the campus center. The smartest choice I made this year was buying a bike. I have a class in the Thomas building daily, which is a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Biking can reduce that time to just 5 minutes if I ride fast enough. The only issue is that Pollock Road, the most direct route to the Thomas building from my house, can be challenging to travel on, whether by bike or on foot. Walking has its advantages, but personally, I’m too busy to walk. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable way to get to class. Walking to Thomas every day would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day, totaling over two and a half hours each week. This doesn't include all the additional time I'd spend walking to other classes and appointments. That's more time than I can afford to lose.",
            "In \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley critiques the looming dangers of technology and the capitalist framework that supports it by depicting a dystopian society. In this society, individuals prioritize community over personal identity and are conditioned from birth to seek immediate gratification above all else. The citizens are mere instruments in a larger scheme, restricted to a single ideology as directed by the World Controller. A Marxist analysis of the novel reveals Huxley's underlying concerns about the growth of these systems. Marxist concepts like homogeny and reification help underscore that Huxley's work critiques the flaws in the emerging economy of his era.\n\nCapitalism is mocked using the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where ordinary people are kept from understanding their true economic relationships with other classes because they are focused on personal gain. This is attributed to the ideological control over the proletariat and common laborers, clearly demonstrated by the conditioning in \"Brave New World.\" The lower classes, such as Delta and Gamma, lack true autonomy; hypnopaedia enforces their desire to consume and indulge above all else, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, the domination of social classes by another group, is evident here. The lower classes are unaware of this manipulation, literally buying into an ideology that sustains capitalist and consumerist structures. The upper classes, born with awareness, largely do nothing; few Alphas or Betas, like Bernard, challenge their roles. The interactions between social classes highlight the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" authentic relationships between individuals do not exist. The novel intentionally avoids distinguishing its characters, even major ones, who lack depth. Huxley may be suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism strips individuals of free will and self-expression. Love and extreme emotions are absent, with interactions remaining superficial, as shown by male characters' comments on women's physical traits and women's candid discussions about their encounters. Additionally, each class's acceptance of its position in the hierarchy reflects the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their complete compliance with their societal role illustrates Marxist views on the proletariat, falsely assured of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform with their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. A major topic of intense debate in the class was whether Islam is a hostile religion. I feel that this question is even more pertinent today than it was before. Reflecting on the events since 9/11, I have seen the mass media shift from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme form of tolerance for Islam in America. I doubt that back in 2001, we would have ever seen a presidential candidate with the name Barack Obama, who has a clear Muslim heritage in his family.\n\nThe Prophet's biography fascinates me because, based on what I know of Muhammad's history, it seems to contradict his personality. From my past knowledge and learning, I believed that Muhammad compelled conversions to Islam. He would conquer tribes and then force them to adopt Islam. However, according to the biography, Muhammad is portrayed as a sort of martyr, misunderstood and humble before others, after which people gradually came to acknowledge the 'truth' in his teachings and sought him out.\n\nAdditionally, there are striking similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad. Most notably, he multiplied mutton and milk to feed more than forty men. This style of writing suggests that the authors wanted Muhammad to be seen as a humble prophet who needed no validation, living simply in truth and miracles. This kind of portrayal is problematic because it diminishes the miracles and life of Jesus Christ. To me, it seems like they are trying to take credit for Jesus's life and identity through Muhammad.\n\nMoreover, the biography contains numerous stories suggesting that part of its aim is to provide evidence of how people supposedly 'independently' converted to Islam. However, many stories are from at least a third-party perspective, with the author describing information as heard from someone who heard from someone else, and so on. I found this troubling because, even though their intention was to provide proof of the stories' truth, it seemed to undermine the stories and make them more suspicious.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is how they attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. Yet, history contradicts the notion of Muhammad as a gentle and humble man, and I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus were quickly set aside as Christian thought developed after his life. Looking at history broadly, Christianity appears to have diverged significantly from its origins. In today's world, there is a growing awareness and a strong progressive trend. While traditionalists remain and resist thinking beyond what they've been taught, they may not be influential enough to sway the entire population. Among Christians, historical awareness is expected to rise significantly in the coming years, sparking a desire to separate the doctrines added over time from the original intentions of Jesus. This process may take decades or centuries, but it seems inevitable: a significant shift in Christian history will occur, reverting back to its original form. A movement will grow, peeling away layers of doctrine until only the essence of what Jesus introduced remains. When this trend spreads across the United States and Europe, encouraging people to worship as if they were living during Jesus' time, the church as an institution will continue to lead. However, as the theological landscape shifts backward, the diversity within Christianity will give way to increased uniformity in belief and practice. Instead of differences, there will be growing similarities between regions, denominations, and divisions. History is full of such reversions; for example, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, yet that empire later became a Christian institution. Similarly, the country moved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The forthcoming reversion will unfold within Christianity, seeking its roots and reducing diversity. An essential part of this process will be interpreting Jesus’ words metaphorically rather than literally. So, what happened since Jesus' time? Looking back in history, we find only Judaism, the theological foundation for Christianity. Monotheism, the idea of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion by the time Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish community was not unified, with divisions among Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of common people.",
            "I think The Jungle demonstrates that humans are inherently greedy and self-centered, primarily looking out for their own interests and improving their lives, without concern for those below them. The book illustrates this in several ways, notably through the owners and managers of large factories. Their sole focus is on expanding their businesses, without regard for anyone or anything that might suffer due to their progress. Upton Sinclair's description highlights the environmental harm caused by pollution: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair aims to portray the significant damage this smoke causes, showing how the factory owners ignore the impact on people and animals. They disregard the smoke clouds from their factories and the waste runoff from the numerous pens in Packingtown. \n\nThe factory owners and managers were indifferent to the plight of their workers who toiled to enrich them. They would go to any lengths to increase their profits, as illustrated by the notion that \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Employees endured terrible working hours and could be laid off in large numbers without notice, compensation, or assistance in finding new jobs. During the period in which The Jungle is set, there were few, if any, laws or regulations to protect workers' safety or welfare. This lack of oversight allowed managers and owners to exploit their workforce, demanding increased productivity under harsh conditions. Although not stated explicitly, the book suggests that those living and working in Packingtown were expected to endure poor conditions both at work and in their living environment. There were no organizations to inform or assist the workers. While unions existed, they often exploited the workers instead of helping them, profiting from their struggles. The workers were treated so poorly, with no escape from the Packingtown system, that they were likened to slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is considered by Edgar Allan Poe to be one of his finer poems. In it, he uses the term \"Thulé\" twice, in lines 6 and 56, a reference that Mabbott links back to Virgil. Virgil mentioned Thulé as an island north of Britain, which the Greeks believed to be the boundary of the known world. While Virgil indeed used this term, there is also a more contemporary source that deserves attention—Poe's interest in German authors. This connection is significant as it highlights Poe's familiarity with Goethe's works. In his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" Karl J. Arndt discusses the similarities between Poe's and Goethe's poems, suggesting that Poe was influenced by Goethe.\n\nThe \"Oxford Companion to English Literature\" notes that Goethe was renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts, with the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of his death. In the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem narrates the story of a king who, after his wife's death, becomes consumed by grief and drinking. He eventually decides to die, passing his possessions to his children, except for a goblet his wife gave him. He throws the goblet into the ocean and dies on a cliff. The somber mood of \"The King of Thulé\" mirrors the portrayal of the king in \"Dream-Land,\" possibly reflecting Poe's own experiences of loss and reliance on alcohol. Additionally, \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, just before Poe used the term Thulé in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe references Thulé twice in his works: once using \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a dark and lonely Thulé, haunted by memories of dead friends and a colorless world. These themes resonate with Goethe's \"The King of Thulé,\" where the king, grieving his wife's death, becomes desolate and loses his will to live. It is as if the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" is stepping into the world of Goethe’s poem.\n\nGoethe was a significant author whom Poe would have been aware of, partly due to his admiration for Tennyson. Poe's exposure to Goethe’s works would have been likely, given their widespread reproductions following their original publication.",
            "In California, could a customer injured by slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be granted punitive damages if the store manager acted with malice, having been informed twice about the spill but neglecting to clean it for 30 minutes due to being on a dinner break? A judge might not immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To justify such a claim, the plaintiff must show that the defendant acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm their actions could cause and that the behavior was despicable. Palmer could argue that Martin should have been aware of the potential harm from not cleaning the spill, given that several D&D customers had been injured from similar incidents in the preceding months. Despite this awareness, he still failed to address the spill. While Palmer's claim that Martin's actions were despicable is less convincing, it is still reasonable considering that six slip-and-fall accidents occurred in 2009, yet Martin did not take the necessary steps to ensure store safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed his manager, Paul Martin, of an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin, on his dinner break, replied that he \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin of the spill, receiving the same response. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill and suffered a severe back injury. Before Palmer’s accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the claim for punitive damages.\n\nIn California, punitive damages can be recovered for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice,\" according to Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Malice is defined as conduct intended to cause harm, or if there is no intent, the conduct must be \"despicable\" and done with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others,\" as per § (c)(1). Courts have deemed conduct malicious when done with a conscious disregard for the plaintiff’s rights, recognizing the likely dangerous outcomes of the conduct and willfully failing to prevent those outcomes.

            "She had always felt as though something was missing in her life. This insatiable yearning began when she was around 14, just stepping into her teenage years, and persisted even at 17. Over time, she realized she craved someone, not something. However, she hadn't felt drawn to any boys. Some tried to court her, awkwardly attempting to win over someone seemingly uninterested, yet none captured her attention. She frequently pondered this peculiar feeling, trying to understand why it was happening to her. Despite years of reflection leading to various theories, none were convincing enough for her to entertain seriously. So she continued living, always questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was typically serene. Her parents were calm and kind, rarely arguing with each other and seldom with her. Their only disagreements revolved around her expression of independence and free spirit. Although she was the child of a tranquil couple, her vibrant and lively personality contrasted with theirs, making her very likable due to her kindness.\n\nToday, however, was different. As she wandered from room to room seeking inspiration, she heard a sudden scream from the kitchen, her mother's melodic voice. Panicking, she rushed in, exclaiming, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the floor, clearly in pain, repeatedly gasping \"Ow.\" Her daughter hurried to her side, trying to help. \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need you to take me to... the hospital,\" her mother uttered, her words strained and hurried, conveying her severe discomfort. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up,\" she responded. Guided by her mother, she managed to carry her, thankful for the strength she had gained from classes. She placed her mother in the back of the car and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital visit was filled with the smells of disinfectant and illness, mixed with anxiety. But she wasn't focused on that, her mind was occupied with aiding her mother. She swiftly carried her inside and called for medical assistance. Concerned faces gathered, and someone quickly brought a rolling bed, laying her mother on it. They took her away for immediate medical attention, leaving her daughter to anxiously wait.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a step stool while attempting to retrieve a vase from their highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke-related deaths. The aMed diet is an adapted form of the Med diet, characterized by increased intake of plant-based foods like plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (as opposed to saturated fats), and fish, while reducing the consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective research found an inverse relationship between Med diet adherence and the risk of overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, and an intervention study revealed that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in obese individuals. Previous studies did not specifically address stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without prior CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score on six occasions using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) to evaluate nutrient intake over the previous year. Over 95% of nurses continued their participation throughout the 20-year duration. FFQs were validated through studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified by reviewing medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, incidents were classified as \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions categorized this way. For each FFQ, body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated, and from 1986 onward, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation for individuals and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were computed (averaging scores from the previous two years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that might skew results) by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard models were employed to evaluate the association between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as shown by a greater aMed diet score, was linked to a reduced risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, there were 2,391 new cases of CHD, 1,763 new cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (including fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",

These demonstrations, led by many Burmese monks, were dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution\" in reference to the color of the monks' robes. Initially, the general public began to support the protests, and while the government initially tolerated the monks' peaceful gatherings, the situation soon escalated into a violent conflict between the monks and the junta. The military began storming and looting monasteries nationwide. Foreign journalists were detained and jailed immediately, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed on September 27, 2007, just for being at a protest. Although the official death count stands at 13, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army just before the report was released, claimed, \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is not a new phenomenon. While these are some recent examples of global atrocities, the tendency of governments to suppress opposition and maintain total control has existed as long as civilization. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine selection to rule every aspect of society. Japanese emperors were believed to be gods themselves, sent to lead their people to prosperity, with Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri being part of their influence. Meanwhile, our current president, George W. Bush, regularly consults with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subgroup of the Republic Party.\n\nNotable examples of such governmental actions include the June 4, 1989, protest in Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students protested against authoritarian rule. The death toll for this event varies significantly, with Chinese government reports citing 200-300 deaths, while the Chinese Red Cross reported between 2,000-3,000 deaths. Another example is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias, supported by the Rwandan government, systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of ethnicity. Hitler's \"Third Reich,\" encompassing several years and countries, involved the mass murder of people of Jewish descent and stands as another extreme instance.",
            "Duke Ellington's impact on jazz is largely rooted in his long career and his exceptional talent in shaping his orchestra. While his piano presence is understated in many compositions chosen for this task, Ellington's prowess as a composer shines through his ability to craft intricate and layered pieces that highlight his band members' individual talents. He provided a framework for soloists to improvise freely while also composing tightly orchestrated pieces that leveraged the unique styles of his musicians to bring out musical themes. This approach allowed him to emphasize the overall tone of the orchestra, producing coherent and unique sounds tailored to each piece. Ellington's understanding of each player's sound and their role within the ensemble enabled him to create some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, when discussing Ellington's sound and innovation, cites \"Creole Love Call\" as an example of his use of voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This piece showcases Ellington's early use of voice to add texture and color without lyrics. \"Creole Love Call\" also highlights Ellington's ability to complement his soloists' styles, a trait evident throughout his career. The piece is a slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues with six choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A call and response between voice and reeds, starting smooth and melodic, and ending with a rougher tone.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that builds on the basic melody and emphasizes extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, where the reeds initiate the call and response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: Returns to the structure of the first chorus, with a call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice uses a \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: A brief tag with a vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending.\n\nEllington's use of voice to enhance the tonal color in this piece exemplifies a stylistic trait prevalent in his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington merges his skill in tight orchestration with his sensitivity to tone color. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing blends Miley's vocal-like trumpet playing with Cox's instrumental vocal qualities to create a rich and complementary sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" expands on these ideas, with Ellington effectively utilizing Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a key member of his orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the specific ways they do? Are there any limitations or constraints that affect the path of evolutionary change? In 1917, D’Arcy Thompson remarked that \"even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" and this observation still holds true today. Recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to broader aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis across both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research aims to investigate how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, along with experimental studies, can clarify the mechanisms behind the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental change. We utilized X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters for modeling both hypothetical and actual skeletal shapes. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We created models of hypothetical shell shapes to interpret the limits of possible morphological change in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to enhance our understanding of macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be considered a structure that acts as a tube traveling over time through 360 degrees of space. The revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are termed whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which the whorls grow can vary, and each whorl is separated by a continuous line called a suture. Typically, the largest whorl of a shell is the last one, known as the body whorl. The spire includes all whorls except the last, with the apex being the tip of the spire and the opposite end referred to as the base. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed in apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. (The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex pointing upwards.)\n\nThe following method is used for counting whorls. First, view the shell from the apical perspective and identify where the first suture begins. Then, draw a line dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line, estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. It is possible to trace the aperture's path using the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture, as well as the horizontal and vertical radii of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented both graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical formulation is established, it becomes possible to adjust parameters and alter the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Over the past decade, the neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia have shown little change. Although the country is progressing towards achieving several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, the advancements in child and maternal health are insufficient to meet the 2015 targets. The reasons for these gaps will be explored further, highlighting the need to bolster the health system rather than merely implementing programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made strides in ensuring that more births are attended by skilled health workers, with 72% now achieving this benchmark. However, this figure includes traditional practitioners like midwives who cannot perform medical interventions in complicated pregnancies, contributing to a high rate of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. Thus, the progress in this area is somewhat deceptive, and significant work remains. Furthermore, there has been a decrease in the proportion of children under five receiving professional treatment for diarrhea. Although postnatal care data is incomplete, it is evident that care rates remain low nationwide.\n\nCesarean section rates remain lower than expected, at roughly 4%. This statistic highlights another issue: while urban areas report a 7% c-section rate, rural areas see only 2%, indicating inequitable healthcare coverage across the country. Access is primarily concentrated in urban regions. Additionally, vertical equity is a concern, with a 27% disparity in service utilization between the poorest and richest groups, suggesting that financial barriers hinder the poor from accessing healthcare.\n\nIn contemplating the next steps to enhance neonatal and maternal care indicators, the fundamental question is how best to tackle service deficiencies. Should Indonesia focus on specific programmatic initiatives or strengthen the overall health system without emphasizing pre and post-pregnancy care? Program-specific approaches are appealing due to their targeted, manageable objectives and generally quicker results. However, these approaches have significant drawbacks. Investing heavily in one health sector area can lead to reduced funding and resources for others, as seen with international funding for HIV/AIDS affecting the family planning sector. Moreover, running multiple parallel programs leads to redundant and uncoordinated services, resulting in increased paperwork and supply management challenges.",
            "Over the last century, the classification of Popular Music has expanded to such an extent that listing all its genres has become quite challenging. Adding to the complexity, almost all genres—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—have given rise to numerous sub-genres and even sub-sub-genres. Notably, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has emerged as one of the most varied and expressive genres in popular music over the past forty years. It is expressive due to its ability to convey a wide array of emotions, though it often leans towards darker themes. It is also diverse, as people quickly realized the genre's flexibility shortly after its inception, leading them to create their own sub-genres and further subdivide those, continuing the trend to the present day.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal scene has diversified into so many niche groups that pinpointing the exact definition of heavy metal is difficult. It has absorbed numerous elements from other genres, yet, like all things, it originated from somewhere. To truly comprehend the metal music that is prevalent today, one must first grasp what the metal movement entails and why it is considered a movement rather than merely a genre.\n\nIn many respects, metal is a movement characterized by darkness. It's often described as \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more aggression, more theatricality. There's less primitivism and more technical skill, as metal musicians are typically very proficient with their instruments, which is evident in their music. Additionally, metal is, unsurprisingly, a movement heavily influenced by drugs. The psychedelic drug surge in the mid-1970s led to people creating wild, otherworldly records, using drugs as a catalyst for their creativity. It exhibits numerous dark, visceral qualities, a stark contrast to much of the popular music that lacked these darker emotional elements. Later generations of metal have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral aspects that were prominent during the Romantic Era. Lyrics from songs like \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles illustrate this darkness, representing the emotional highs and lows, possibly influenced by drugs. This song is considered by some as one of the early Heavy Metal tracks and was a response to a darker, heavier Rolling Stones song. The Beatles aimed to prove they could match the heaviness of the Stones, so they included it on \"The White Album.\"",
            "Several decades before Surrealist artists started creating their dreamlike imagery, Henri Rousseau was meticulously crafting his own visions, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only depicts a woman marveling at the wonders of a dreamt land but also symbolizes Rousseau's personal ambitions as an artist. From the beginning of his career, he aspired for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from his peers and art enthusiasts, facing a challenging internal conflict to achieve these goals. The Dream best encapsulates Rousseau's lifelong struggle between adhering to or emulating certain artistic styles to gain acceptance in the esteemed art world he admired and maintaining his creative independence and originality.\n\nTo understand The Dream from this angle, it's essential to know some of Rousseau's background. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Henri Rousseau's father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed middle-class prosperity (Shattuck 47). Rousseau did not receive formal art training; instead, he worked for France's municipal toll service until the age of forty, earning the mistaken title of douanier, or customs inspector (Shattuck 46). After losing his first wife, Clémence, and eight of their infant children, Rousseau was left with his daughter, Julia, and profound grief (Shattuck 49). Seeking solace, he turned to painting for comfort and a new beginning. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized peasants in their art, Rousseau was fundamentally a folk painter with the aspirations of an average person from his social class.\n\nRousseau's strong desire for acceptance in the art world is understandable when viewed in context: he lacked formal art education, started his career later in life, and created art alongside many other talented, well-known modern artists. Despite years of work, Rousseau only began receiving proper recognition for his art around the same time Matisse was establishing his artistic reputation. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes that although Rousseau and Matisse were technically competitors, they differed not only in style and subject but also in their motivations for painting: \"Matisse was a painter who feared painting in a clichéd way, while Rousseau aimed to create art so conventional that he would be accepted by the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "Many influential thinkers have suggested a deep link between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. I think there's a fundamental reason for this connection. As John Keats expresses in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” We acquire much of our knowledge through education or experience. Yet, as Keats hints, we seem to understand ethics and aesthetics instinctively, rather than through traditional learning. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than dictate. Our exploration of morality and beauty primarily seeks to explain why a piece of art or a deed is beautiful or moral, instead of providing a checklist for evaluating or creating good art or ethical actions.\n\nMoreover, critiques of art or morals never fully capture the essence of what makes something good or beautiful. Discussions about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on aspects like composition, contrast, or cultural significance, but these don't explain why it's great art. Often, when describing a favorite artwork or literary piece, people say, \"There's just something about it\" before offering a more detailed critique. I believe that neither art nor morals can be entirely reduced to a list of their features. As Flannery O'Connor notes, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” Even with a thorough description of a literary work, something transcendent remains. I think ethics shares this quality. As Wittgenstein states, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.” I propose that this \"something,\" this indefinable quality, is the most potent aspect of art and morality, and it is this transcendent nature that links ethics and aesthetics.\n\nI believe that morality and art are closely connected because we experience both on a level that is felt rather than fully articulated, aligning with Kantian ideas of the noumenal. This connection is even more pronounced with literature. As McKean observes, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Modern Germany is seen as a powerful and unified nation, with a distinct culture stretching from the Alps' shadows in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This cultural uniqueness is also evident from Cologne along the Rhine River, through central Germany, to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. It's no wonder that contemporary Germany is a fusion of various sources and tribes.\n\nThe ancient region known as Germania is the ancestral home of the Germans, though the origin of the name is a topic of debate among scholars and historians. Tacitus suggested that the name derived from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were referred to as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and fought the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first mentioned the term “Germanus” in his account of the Gallic Wars, using it to differentiate between the Gauls he had conquered and the Germanic tribes he had not, borrowing the term from the Gauls themselves. Some believe the name referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter of his initial book on these wars, Caesar noted, “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others argue the name might derive from the spear, known as a ger, used in warfare (O.E.D, 2010), or from the Old Irish word garim, meaning “to shout,” suggesting the Germans were loud or noisy (Names of Germany).\n\nTacitus, an early Roman historian, wrote in AD 98's “De Origine et situ Germanorum” about the German origins, stating, “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive... Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nWhy would anyone leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans at that time. They would occasionally send expeditions into Germania for resources and conduct land campaigns, but they mostly returned to their vast empire. As Germanic tribes began emerging in the mid-first century, they lived on the Roman Empire's borders, trading goods from their lands and serving as soldiers in the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "The play Twelfth Night suggests that while disguise can be effective for prolonged deception, a person must eventually abandon this false identity to avoid losing themselves entirely. However, ending such deception can lead to feelings of alienation. Ultimately, one must choose between self-preservation and maintaining relationships with others. Some may react indifferently to being deceived, but others may take offense at the pretense. Deception involving gender role reversal is especially complex, raising questions about why someone might abandon their identity to adopt that of the opposite gender. In Viola's situation, disguising herself as a man is a means of self-protection: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Newly arrived in an unfamiliar land, Viola finds it necessary to pose as a man to safeguard herself from potential threats. While her plan succeeds, it also isolates her from other women, severing a vital support network. Compounding the issue, Viola is so convincing as a man that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, Viola grapples with unspoken romantic feelings toward Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261). To contemporary readers, Twelfth Night might demonstrate how deception can reveal hidden emotions, particularly for Olivia and Orsino. Some passages suggest that these characters might have unvoiced subconscious desires that Viola/Cesario's presence compels them to confront. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario seems male, or does she secretly have feelings for women? It seems unlikely since Shakespeare's Olivia appears to satirize those who judge others solely on appearance. This is shown by how easily Olivia transfers her affection from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to view Cesario/Viola as family rather than a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "Various observers have highlighted the harshness of German colonial rule, particularly concerning the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, describing an entire colonial empire with such a simplistic view would be misleading. The German colonial empire's policies and governance were as diverse as its geographical expanse. Similarly, educational opportunities varied across the colonies. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a significant number of educated and literate Africans. German efforts in education in Kamerun and other colonies received acclaim from contemporary writers. \n\nIn contrast, the situation in South West Africa (now Namibia) was markedly different. Unlike East Africa, where the government established state schools and actively participated in the education of the natives, in South West Africa, native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies with minimal government support. However, the government did allocate substantial resources for the education of Europeans, creating state schools and providing greater support and regulation for missionary schools. These educational strategies had long-term impacts on South West Africa, persisting even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies had significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to South West Africa's differing experience. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors and highlight new research on settlers' and colonial authorities' attitudes towards native Africans.\n\nThere is extensive literature focused specifically on education within the German colonial empire. Most of these works, written in German, date back to the early twentieth century, during or shortly after German colonial rule. The initial aim of these writings was mainly to detail the educational systems in these colonies. Later English-language studies expanded the discussion through comparative analyses of education across different German colonies and more in-depth examinations of specific educational aspects. These studies revealed significant disparities in the educational systems among the colonies. The most notable work directly addressing the topic of this paper is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and explores the factors behind their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa accounts for many of the unique features of its educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonies, South West Africa had a relatively moderate climate, despite much of its territory being arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans resided in South West Africa, while the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa, had only 5,336.",
            "The United States and Mexico once experienced a prolonged rivalry that lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The peak of this conflict was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, acquiring Texas and the American Southwest. Numerous other conflicts occurred between the two countries, eventually diminishing just before World War I. This rivalry was rooted in clashes over significant issues such as religion, culture, tradition, and material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31). \n\nSimilar to many other nations with enduring rivalries, countries sharing borders often have conflicting interests leading to rivalries. The United States and Mexico exemplify this common pattern among neighboring nations. According to David M. Pletcher (1977), \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). These two countries, due to their proximity, have been historical rivals of the United States, whereas other Latin American countries have generally maintained good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences were a significant source of tension between the two nations, a challenge faced by many countries throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). Unlike the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was partly ideological, the U.S.-Mexico tensions were more about religious preferences. This distrust originated from the historical animosity between the English and Spanish, which complicated the establishment of friendly relations between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identify 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry period, mostly involving territorial issues such as border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier problems. Bandit raids from American border towns persisted until both countries applied military force along their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). According to Schmitt (1974), the rivalry began to subside as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and concluded as American goals shifted \"from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p.110) in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was unexpectedly struck by an illness that left me disabled, one I had never heard of before. At that time, I was working as a nurse. I chose nursing because I had a deep-seated need for the safety and security I lacked during my childhood. I often heard the saying, \"You'll always have a job because people will always get sick,\" as I grew up. Despite my dreams of becoming a scientist or a journalist—or perhaps both—I pursued a career in nursing.\n\nHowever, at 46, I found myself single, with no substantial savings, and unable to work. I remain disabled and after 15 years relying on Social Security Disability, I have virtually nothing to call my own. I manage to get by, but each day is a challenge that threatens my security, safety, and self-esteem. While nothing in my life feels certain now, I do know one thing: I couldn't have survived all these years without the support of my family and a few good friends, no matter how strong I thought I was. When true disaster hits, strength feels elusive.\n\nThe truth is, life is full of emergencies, both big and small. There are no guarantees, and some challenges are too overwhelming to handle alone, regardless of how prepared one might be. I completely agree that in the U.S., we need to stop relying solely on the government, which is clearly faltering. Instead, I would prefer to see Americans learning to trust and help one another again, rather than each of us building individual fallout shelters.\n\nConservatives in the U.S. often speak about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country; however, it was actually compassion, mutual respect, and resource-sharing that sustained our forefathers during tough times. The pioneers who traveled across the Rockies in wagon trains didn't reach the West Coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, absolutely, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting with duct tape for the windows in case of a biological attack. I also have various flashlights, plenty of batteries, numerous candles, waterproof matches, and canned food. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and can preserve your own food, do it. It's a great idea, as is having a wood stove, provided you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're preparing, take the time to get to know your neighbors.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he gave up worldly pursuits, attained enlightenment, and his teachings eventually gave rise to Buddhism. The most traditional branch of this religion is called Theravada Buddhism. Buddhism is approximately 2,500 years old, and it has evolved since the time of Buddha. This evolution is evident in various places, such as Sri Lanka, a Theravada Buddhist nation, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is held. Both monks and laypeople engage in this ceremony, which holds some religious importance, even though Buddha never mentioned such festivities. These changes are evident in the superficial practices and the fundamental beliefs of the religion. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community, including both monastics and laypersons, has had to adapt its doctrinal principles due to various influences, both from within and outside the community, and both beneficial and detrimental.\n\nSeveral key terms will be frequently used in this discussion. There is the distinction between internal and external forces. An internal force arises from members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of whether they are monastics. An external force originates from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is one that harms or intends to harm the Buddhist community, stemming from a negative view of Buddhism. A benign force neither aims to help nor harm the community, though it might inadvertently do either. These terms will be referenced often throughout the discussion.\n\nTo begin, it's important to explore the fundamental aspects of the religion—the core doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma primarily consists of the Tripitaka, or the \"three baskets,\" of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka includes the rules of discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. The metaphysical ideas include Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (the inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (the impermanence of everything). Understanding these concepts is essential to end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which occurs continuously. With the end of Sansara, one also ends lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) upon achieving enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for living. Laypeople follow five precepts: abstaining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and taking intoxicants. Monks follow many more disciplinary rules. The most fundamental doctrinal concept in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. The first is Dukkha, the truth that life is suffering. The second is that attachment causes suffering. The third is that suffering can be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day!

            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture is a crucial factor in negotiations. It can be understood not only by its characteristics but also by what it is not and what it represents. Culture is diverse and not a single, uniform entity. Generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are overly simplistic and broad. While grasping cultural generalizations is useful, it is more beneficial for a negotiator to comprehend the relevance of a culture to the negotiation and how its attitudes may influence discussions. When encountering a foreign culture, one tends to relate it to their own, leading to comparisons.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset might involve anything from exploring its history to recognizing its biases. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, one should accept it as it is and operate within its framework, especially in negotiations, and particularly if one is at a disadvantage. Moreover, when negotiating in unfamiliar territory, respecting traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and advance the negotiation.\n\nIt's important to remember that culture extends beyond national or international divides. Companies often develop their own corporate culture, which may prioritize long work hours or a more relaxed approach. Corporate culture is visible in employee dress codes, communication styles (direct vs. indirect), delegation of tasks, and hiring practices. Some companies support philanthropy at any employee level, while others limit it to approved charities or fundraisers. The diversity within American corporate culture, varying from company to company and even within regions, highlights the variety of thought within a societal culture. While some cultures may seem less stratified than American culture and appear more uniform, this is just a cue to explore deeper.\n\nUnderstanding values is even more crucial because they explain the reasons behind a culture's behavior. If a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superior to succeed. Similarly, a negotiator from a culture that prioritizes tough bargaining won't be quick to settle. Considering these generalities is essential before negotiations begin. However, it is beneficial for a negotiator to learn about their counterpart on a personal level to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "The phrase \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” originates in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is used by St. Anselm in his argument about God's existence. This belief is shared by Thomas Aquinas, another thinker we will examine. Since both authors argue in favor of the same idea, our task is to determine whose argument is superior. For conciseness, we will assume that they both believe in the existence of the God depicted in the Bible. Considering a different concept of God would hinder a fair comparison of their arguments, as both defend a specific notion of God. However, it seems neither author provides a comprehensive foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo explore this, we first look at St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm's perspective involves understanding through faith, suggesting that proof of God is found within oneself. He argues that since God exists in our understanding, we cannot truly imagine his nonexistence. Although his explanation can be complex and unclear, the main idea is that God's existence is confirmed by reflecting on what we inherently know to be true in our minds, without needing external evidence. This acceptance of beliefs without empirical proof is commonly called faith in Christian texts.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, on the other hand, proposes that God's existence can be established entirely through reason and empirical evidence, without the need for faith. This approach would be advantageous for evangelism, a key aspect of Christianity, as it allows for persuading new converts through logic alone. Aquinas outlines five logical arguments proving God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each, he shows that God's existence is a logical necessity. Just as you can deduce the features and existence of a missing puzzle piece by assembling the rest, you can use logic to infer the necessity of God.",
            "Authors often employ various techniques to evoke specific emotions or attitudes in their readers regarding significant topics. Some techniques are more successful than others. In his novel The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes a range of these methods. One approach involves pairing an adjective with a noun in an unconventional way to create a particular atmosphere around a subject. Another technique is assigning meaning to a symbol and using it to achieve the same effect. Fitzgerald notably employs this latter technique with colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, he assigns specific meanings to colors like white/gray and red/pink, later using these meanings to evoke certain feelings associated with important objects.\n\nFitzgerald establishes and employs the meaning of white/gray to represent uniformity, with white suggesting a higher class and gray symbolizing something older and faded. He introduces this meaning early in the novel through frequent use. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are often depicted \"in white\" (8); indeed, many characters wear white: Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only exception is when Nick observes Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further solidifies these colors by applying them to mundane subjects: Nick descends \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), guest names at Gatsby's parties are listed as \"gray names\" (61), and Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—signifying uniformity (28). He also uses white and gray to describe ordinary people or places: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" by the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald establishes enough meaning for white/gray, he uses them to denote unimportance or uniformity in certain subjects, beginning with Daisy. After a period of little use of these colors, Daisy is described as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" prompting readers to perceive her as less of a distinct character and more as a uniform addition, something Gatsby desires (74). Fitzgerald continues this portrayal of Daisy as an element of uniformity, for example, in the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18), and again in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County boasts significant agricultural productivity due to its mild and sunny climate. It commonly produces crops such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a notable demand for organic community-supported agriculture in the San Diego region, with many local groups experiencing long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Numerous organic farms offer tours of their agricultural practices and provide opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This type of operation allows landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitats, thus enabling recreational use and offering farm tours and educational programs as sources of income.\n\nIn addition to tapping into a potentially profitable niche market, organic farming often results in increased biodiversity among plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming can be more costly than conventional farming in certain respects. It demands more intensive labor and management for pest and weed control and soil fertilization without chemicals, and losses can be higher compared to conventional methods. Small organic farms also lack the efficiency of scale enjoyed by larger operations. Practices beneficial to wildlife, although not directly related to organic farming, may also increase labor expenses, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, removing invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create specific conditions like edge habitats or open ground patches. Therefore, the landowner in this scenario may seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land selected for this example is a 160-acre parcel near Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It consists of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. It is located in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which is still under review but currently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many of these species are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, while others like burrowing owls are declining and may soon be listed.\n\nThis area was home to Native Americans for countless centuries before cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers settled it in the late 1800s. The land was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing and/or wood production over many decades. I chose a property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to explore the realistic options a small farmer might have for reducing costs and maintaining wildlife-friendly operations. As a model of what someone farming this land might aim to achieve, I identified an organic farm in the same area.",
            "There exists an unbreakable and undeniable connection between brothers, filled with a multitude of emotions such as love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. This unique bond allows brothers to understand each other more deeply than anyone else could, seeing themselves reflected in one another. It is during the most critical moments that the true essence of this bond is revealed, whether for better or worse. When these emotions surface, they come at a significant cost. Understanding the feelings that arise from this fraternal connection involves dealing with the consequences they bring. Looking into a brother's eyes and seeing one's own reflection allows a person to see themselves not as others do, but as they truly are. Their true character is revealed through their actions and the repercussions of those actions. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers explore this theme, along with the intense emotions it involves. Against a richly detailed backdrop, these boys embark on a hopeless journey. In the climactic scene, bitter disappointment collides with intense pride, and only one brother survives. The theme is conveyed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which expresses the complex emotions felt by the protagonist and his view of the surrounding world, both of which greatly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by one key emotion: pride. From his first outing with his younger brother, Doodle, to their final, tragic adventure, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He had envisioned a brother he could teach skills like \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He desired a brother to \"race to Horsehead Landing... and perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn...\" These aspirations were clearly unattainable due to Doodle's condition. Doodle was born with a frail heart, making his survival uncertain, let alone his participation in strenuous activities. This was a devastating blow to the young protagonist, who had filled his head with dreams that were shattered instantly. He even felt anger towards the fragile child, once contemplating suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would consider such a drastic action? Yet, his resolve softened when Doodle smiled at him, a simple gesture that filled the protagonist with hope, indicating that his murderous intention was not deeply rooted. Deep down, he instinctively loved his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex and innovative system for processing information. As technology progressed from basic to sophisticated, so did the metaphors used to describe the brain. Initially likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, a book, and more recently, a computer, these comparisons are useful but have limitations and can lead to incorrect assumptions.  \nInformation processing begins with sensory organs receiving input, converting physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound, and light into electrochemical signals. The brain's algorithms transform this sensory information through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing compiles basic details like color, orientation, and border delineation—where color changes abruptly—to recognize the box. Top-down processing then leverages decisions from the bottom-up process to accelerate recognition, helping to identify the object as a black box rather than a hole in the white background.  \nOnce processed to a certain extent, an attention filter assesses the signal's significance and determines which cognitive processes should access it. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when looking at your shoes, a functional attention filter prevents individual recognition. Conversely, you might notice your name spoken in a noisy room. Processing occurs in multiple stages, with attention continually influencing the outcomes.  \nFor the brain to process information, it first needs storage. This involves several types of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded, with specific encoding types for each sensory input. For instance, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically. Once stored, information must be maintained. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which holds information for about 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal cycling through a series of neurons briefly. Long-term memory is thought to be maintained by the structure of certain proteins.  \nThere are various models of how the brain organizes knowledge, some based on human memory retrieval, others on computer science, and still others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, interconnected based on their relatedness. For instance, in a semantic network, “chair” might connect to “table,” which in turn connects to “wooden,” and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States was hit by a devastating financial crisis. Unemployment rose, the housing market collapsed, and several key American corporations faced severe damage. This recession continues today, prompting us to ask: what caused this crisis, and how can we prevent it? Essentially, the financial turmoil resulted from shortsighted and self-serving political choices that coerced banks and companies into approving sub-prime loans within an already fragile financial system. At the same time, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were urged to endorse and repackage these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves and shifted the resulting turmoil onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold, impacting the broader economy.\n\nThe crisis traces back to 1999 during the Clinton administration, as the President aimed to secure a second term by boosting his popularity. To achieve this, the Clinton administration loosened lending regulations, inadvertently setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. In 1999, Steven Holmes from the New York Times noted, “Fannie Mae, the nation’s largest underwriter of home mortgages, has faced growing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income individuals and felt compelled by stockholders to sustain its extraordinary profit growth.” Holmes accurately predicted the outcome of these actions: “But the government-backed corporation could encounter difficulties during an economic downturn, leading to a government bailout similar to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.” As outlined earlier, and as Holmes anticipated, reckless lending would inevitably result in economic collapse.\n\nNumerous elements contributed to the economic downturn, including the new and intricate mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were heavily utilized in the years before the crisis, further entangling more economic sectors with the housing market. This led U.S. households and financial markets overall to excessively invest in the housing market, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities suffered. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, accounting for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. Ultimately, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at remarkably low prices, Lehman Brothers was disbanded, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to become commercial banks subject to stringent regulations. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac held $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That part of your story where you can spread your wings as a writer and captivate everyone with your enchanting prose. Or, conversely, the section where readers might doze off or click away, cursing your name. Dr. Merlin has been known to yell at her screen when she's bombarded with an overload of information, and not even in an enjoyable way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy gentle readers are already familiar with the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself in lengthy segments of text where either nothing occurs or too much does. Exposition is like the little devil on your shoulder suggesting you get the history out of the way to reach the exciting parts (not to be confused with the devil on the other shoulder urging you to share every single detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition involves telling the audience what happened, usually in straightforward prose. In film, exposition occurs when one character dumps a load of information onto another, much like \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nAn example is needed. As you read a story, you learn that the heroine met her beloved at a specific place and time, that they had a grand wedding, and that her husband was murdered before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to be covered in just two pages, with only two lines of dialogue each for him and her. You would anticipate the author taking time to develop the husband's character, showing through his words and actions how deeply he loves his wife. Similarly, you would expect the heroine to demonstrate, in various ways, how his presence transformed and enriched her life (especially if the story later explicitly states this). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally invested in his fate and provide insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, the depth of their connection, hints about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as seen through his eyes, and so forth. You would mourn his death with her, thereby growing more attached to the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you would expect more substance to the simple plot line: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that substance. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, continues*) It's sometimes tempting to gloss over certain details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he was in the Air Force, he's now the night manager of a gas station, has been married twice with no kids, enjoys fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one, which was live, aired on NBC 4 on the morning of August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man named Shad Hostettler in Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife, though her name was not mentioned. They showed his mugshot, describing him as looking malevolent. This developing story was covered briefly, lasting only about two minutes. The details provided were that he had stabbed her several times and was arrested. I felt this was an appropriate amount of coverage for the situation.\n\nThe second story was about an early morning shooting involving an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers, who was critically injured in the Sharon Woods area. At the time, no arrests had been made, and there were no suspects, though the SWAT Team was investigating. This story was also short, which I suspect might be because the victim was a Black man or because it occurred in a predominantly Black neighborhood. I've noticed over the years that crimes involving minority victims often receive less attention in the media compared to similar incidents involving white individuals.\n\nAnother story covered was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were provided about where it might have happened, and it was determined that the helicopter had been hit by a .22 caliber rifle bullet. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThe newscast also mentioned the forecast of rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with weekend temperatures expected to remain in the mid to low eighties. The weather segment was brief, likely used as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nAnother report focused on a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned Black man wearing a hoodie, approximately six feet tall and weighing about 150 pounds. I found it unusual how much emphasis was placed on his race and skin tone.\n\nLastly, there was a story about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin from Texas, found guilty of conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana to Ohio. Interestingly, instead of stating his sentence as 25 years, they said \"300 months,\" which might have been intended to sound harsher. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, which I felt was irrelevant to the story.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of security that aims to mirror the performance of an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund. However, it offers greater flexibility because it trades like a stock on an exchange. This type of fund provides the diversification benefits of an index fund while offering advantages akin to owning individual stocks, such as the ability to sell short, purchase on margin, and buy as little as one share per transaction. Despite these appealing features, ETFs typically have much lower expense ratios than the average mutual fund. However, there are drawbacks, such as the requirement to pay a commission on any ETF trade, similar to stock transactions. Another advantage of ETFs is the broad range of available funds. It is important for astute financial investors to assess whether the proclaimed benefits, like diversification, truly exist and to what degree. In this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to determine if owning a single ETF offers similar benefits to owning a diversified portfolio of these ten stocks, and whether alternative configurations of these stocks could yield a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo assess the ETF, we will focus only on the top ten holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets, rather than every holding. Listed below are these top 10 holdings and their percentage of total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these ten stocks reflect the overall ETF IHF, we can use their current percentage of assets, standardized to 100%, to calculate their contributions to a portfolio’s Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consists solely of these 10 stocks in the proportions established by the ETF's holdings. The calculated Beta and return are shown in the chart below.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings yields a return that is 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. It also indicates that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than that of the entire ETF. Thus far, the analysis suggests that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings might offer higher returns with lower beta. However, it is possible that the average outcomes of these two portfolios are not statistically different from each other. To determine if these portfolios are statistically distinct, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is calculated and normalized to 100% to compare their combined standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Referring to Figure 17, there was a sharp decline in the number of commuter log submissions during the project's third month. This was somewhat disappointing, and the reasons for this decrease are not entirely clear. The arrival of winter at a New England campus likely led to fewer people commuting by bicycle or on foot, which could explain part of the reduction. December also coincides with the conclusion of the fall semester, a time when everyone is preoccupied with completing schoolwork, grading, and related tasks, possibly causing the commuter log to be overlooked. Moreover, the busy holiday season begins in December, bringing a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many do not need to visit campus. Classes resume for the spring semester in late January, potentially contributing to the low log submissions during that month. However, this does not fully account for the low submissions in February. It's possible that projects like this experience an initial surge of enthusiasm that later wanes. To counteract this trend, we organized Carpool Challenge Week, a special campaign in March to revitalize the initiative, which successfully increased log submissions for that month. Maintaining project momentum was challenging due to both a natural decline in engagement and the specific issues of holiday and semester breaks typical in higher education. \n\nAnother challenge for this project, as with any alternative commuting initiative, is that people value the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars, which is deeply ingrained in our culture. Therefore, it's crucial to offer incentives for alternative commuting methods. We distributed numerous prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see how even larger prizes might have impacted participation, such as offering a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This might have helped counteract the drop in engagement the project faced. The nature of the prizes remained consistent throughout the project. However, increasing the value of the prizes over time might have been beneficial. While the gift cards were sufficient at the project's start, announcing additional incentives like bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January could have potentially boosted participation and engagement, rather than seeing a decline.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all fifteen trick films made between 1895 and 1901. These films typically utilize creative editing to create illusions. My analysis primarily focused on describing the artistic elements of most trick films and identifying unique evolutionary traits in a few of the later ones. Generally, trick films from the turn of the century were confined to a set, shot within a frontal proscenium, lacked camera movement, employed long and medium shots, and followed a strict one shot equals one film approach. However, some films from the early 1900s began to challenge these norms by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA prominent feature shared by these trick films is the use of an interior set framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, not tracking any movement of figures or objects. This style was typical of early films, influenced by theatrical traditions and, specifically for trick films, vaudeville and magic performances. One limitation of this stage-based approach is that characters in trick films mainly move side-to-side, without approaching or retreating from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move horizontally. Even when they exit the frame, the camera stays in place.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition also results in mostly long shots, with medium shots being less common, and no close-ups appearing in any of the Edison trick films. This mirrors the theatre and vaudeville conventions, where audiences saw the entire performance framed by the stage boundaries. As with most early films, actors do not move towards the camera from the middle ground, so close-ups are absent.\n\nTypically, early trick films follow the principle that a single conceptual shot constitutes a whole film. This restricts the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frame rate used, and limits their dramatic or narrative potential; they mainly focus on short vaudeville-like tricks, such as magic or disappearing acts, with minimal story. However, in trick films, a conceptual shot perceived by the viewer doesn’t necessarily mean a single physical shot. A “shot” might actually comprise several edited together to create illusions of appearance or disappearance. For example, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a closer examination reveals the transition to the shot with Mary's severed \"head,\" even though the entire film is perceived as one continuous shot by the viewer.",
            "The classic \"Gothic Novel\" is, as Ian Watt points out in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, an oxymoron signifying \"Old-New.\" This literary style has been both criticized and praised, accused of lacking depth, and admired for its ability to evoke a 'terrible sublime' (Burke). Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the first \"Gothic Novel,\" combined elements from both \"ancient and modern\" romances to forge the proto-Gothic genre and a new way of literary expression. Walpole incorporated \"old\" theatrical traditions with 'new' natural mimicry from 'modern' novels to create what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre extensively references medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and customs. Even during the publication of The Castle of Otranto, \"gothic\" described various peoples, styles, and eras, often seen as outdated or crude compared to \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The blend of theatrical \"Gothic\" with the novel's new format, which offered readers a more intimate glimpse into characters' psychology, has enabled the Gothic to endure over time, being simultaneously obsolete and fresh to readers far removed from its inception.\n\nA key gothic theme in Gothic novels is the idea of Chivalry. In The Castle of Otranto, the medieval concept of chivalry—the training of a proper knight—is both preserved and transformed. Chivalry holds significant appeal for Gothic authors because it symbolizes the classic knight, brave, honorable, and capable, and the perceived absence of such ideals in society, as seen by writers like Walpole. By employing chivalric ideals and manners, the \"gothic past\" becomes idealized and romanticized (foreshadowing the Gothic's evolution into Romantic) and is used to critique and potentially enhance the present. When writing The Castle of Otranto, Walpole was amidst political turmoil and despondent about the future. Immersed in politics and possibly facing unjust accusations, he might have, even if subconsciously, felt that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" of the gothic era had been lost in contemporary society. This sentiment is evident in his characters, such as Frederic. Before meeting Frederic, readers learn he embodies many chivalric traits; he is depicted as:\n\nFrederic's description is filled with traditional chivalric imagery; he is primarily a prince, who has endured suffering, been properly affected by tragedy, left his home, and is believed to have been slain by infidels. The portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, introducing the Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the sequence of actions required to transfer goods from a customer's order through the stages of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution until they reach the customer. The concept of supply chain management was introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver. He explained the comprehensive process of planning, executing, and overseeing supply chain activities to meet customer needs promptly and efficiently. The six essential components of a supply chain are production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nThe initial step in the supply chain process is production, which serves as the basis for the entire system. This stage involves determining the timing, reasoning, location, and methodology for production. Managers must understand customer preferences, which can be gauged by examining the market. The market is a primary indicator of customer demands. Once managers have assessed the market and comprehend customer needs, they can decide on the products to be manufactured and their quantities. After these decisions, they choose the most suitable production site, considering factors like volume and quality while ensuring customer demands and satisfaction are met. Following the selection of a production location, managers concentrate on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Production is a critical phase in the supply chain, where attention to detail is crucial, as inadequate planning can result in significant time and financial losses for the company. For instance, in my experience at Wal-Mart and Target, both companies had structured guidelines and processes for various business aspects, including employee uniforms and shipment receipt. Clearly defined processes enable smooth operation without confusion about direction and expectations.\n\nThe second crucial component of supply chain management is supply. Supply involves making strategic decisions to determine a facility’s core capabilities, which subsequently guide the development of outsourcing partnerships. A company might have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with distinct equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers need to identify which division is best suited for different stages of production. They might also opt to outsource work to other companies, primarily to achieve velocity. Velocity refers to the capacity to deliver quality and flexibility while simultaneously reducing or maintaining low costs.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the era. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights are considered Victorian novels that deviate from this norm. These two works incorporate elements of mystery and a penchant for the unusual, which are not typical of the period's literature, thereby enhancing the characters and providing deeper insights into their motives and emotions.\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of firearms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nBoth novels frequently use mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the content and purpose differ in each case. In Oliver Twist, these strange events often reveal insights into Oliver’s inner struggles, his pain, and his awareness of the true nature of the events around him. When Oliver's shooting is revisited in chapter 28, he experiences the event as if in a vivid dream, struggling to find help. The passage highlights Oliver’s lack of control over unfolding events and the severe state of his health, as emphasized by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing his senses so much that he fails to notice the \"unseen hand\" that carries him away; he relives his despair, now intertwined with constant pain and fear rather than surprise. This raises the question of who is responsible for his misfortune, as it was clearly not his own doing. The shooting underscores Oliver's lack of control, showing that he cannot even attempt to alter the outcome of events, even when his life is at stake. This passage suggests a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, compelling him to accept this despair and affecting his ability to respond. Otherwise, it could be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least to save his own life.\n\n\"The day passed off—day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come—and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years back, I was involved in an after-school program where I tutored elementary students. I tried my best to assist them in any subject they found challenging, although my expertise was in English and reading. An instructor asked me to help a young boy named Adrian, likely in third or fourth grade, who was facing significant difficulties with reading. I noticed something unusual; he had inconsistent issues with letter pronunciation—some he nailed perfectly, while others were completely off. Adrian was clearly of Latino descent, yet he spoke flawless English. We struggled until one day I met his mother. I was looking after a few students left behind while the rest went on a field trip when she came in. She didn't speak English, only Spanish. Despite my limited Spanish skills, we managed to understand each other. It then struck me: Adrian was proficient in reading but wasn't well-versed in the English alphabet. I can't say for sure if this realization helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, particularly in California. It also illustrates that these challenges aren't always apparent. Even a child fluent in spoken English can face significant hurdles in reading. We all recognize this problem, but what's the solution? In Adrian's situation, the fix was straightforward: focused tutoring in English reading, especially on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children with limited English skills, the solution is more complex. There's no single answer. A combination of dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes is essential.\n\nTo begin, the dual language system is a promising approach, beneficial not just for Spanish-speaking children but for all. Research shows that children in bilingual programs often outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns that such programs might squander resources or benefit only a few, this is untrue. If these programs became standard rather than exceptions, all students would gain. But how do we implement this? Demanding all teachers to be bilingual isn't practical. Nevertheless, there's no reason we can't employ bilingual aides or tutors.",
            "From a young age, many of us are taught that there exists something greater than ourselves, something beyond our comprehension. Some of us attend Sunday school to learn about it, others go to Temple, or seek answers within. Many easily accept the religions passed down by our parents, while others reject them entirely, believing nothing exists beyond their personal, self-centered world. We might embrace one set of beliefs only to later adopt another. Regardless of the path we take, we strive to understand ourselves through our own spiritual perspectives, seeking a guiding light to lead us from darkness to light.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father replied when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on our front porch, listening to the rain on the tin roof while we smoked. The gutters overflowed, soaking the plants by the porch. My father stared into the rain, a gaze that seemed both searching and remembering. He had become thinner, his clothes hanging loosely, and his hair was sparser than I remembered. He continued to look into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt isolated, frightened, unable to express how much I would miss him, fearing that speaking about it would make it more real. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer to his, and joined him in watching the June twilight rain.\n\nMy father passed away that December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation only prolonged his suffering beyond the doctors’ expectations, providing no comfort. I questioned the kind of God who would allow this. Alone at night, I offered no prayers, thinking if God existed, He had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI didn’t want to witness his transition from this life to another, so I didn’t. I couldn’t watch the life that created me come to an end. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father wouldn’t want his only child to witness his death. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and fervent supporter of Republicanism. Though he was mainly a farmer, his profession and brief political career made him known for his commitment and outspoken views on personal freedom and governance. His belief in an agrarian system formed the foundation of nearly all his governmental opinions. His efforts to uphold and promote what he saw as the noblest profession shaped his views on sovereignty, constitutionality, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a unique chance to establish an ideal system, as there was no existing tradition to constrain the government’s founders, enabling the creation of a self-governing system. He was a strong advocate for natural rights and believed they were interlinked—if one right is denied, all will fail, diminishing the value of the remaining rights. Therefore, these rights should be protected from government interference. He argued that in the so-called \"state of nature,\" those with physical strength and cunning intelligence thrived, but this should not be the case in a civilized society.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor argued for a government that acknowledges the inherent good and evil within humans. He held firm views on dualistic morality, stating, “As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human” (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalism, believing a government based on such principles would function fairly regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by greed and self-interest. Taylor saw self-interest as a universal motivator but considered it only evil when it led to the formation of sub-societies that thrived at others’ expense. A good government was essential to restrain man's inherent evil, requiring constant vigilance to prevent the incorporation of harmful principles.\n\nLike many committed Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a highly limited Federal government, permitting only the rights and powers explicitly stated in the Constitution. He recognized that a large Federal government was costly and likely to become tyrannical. However, he believed that a straightforward, literal interpretation could be perilous, as it could easily become corrupt without considering the writers’ intentions. Furthermore, he viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true foundation of the United States, as it more clearly defined the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind trying to take in the view without attaching any deeper meaning to it. With a calm detachment and a practiced eye, I examined the scene before me, my thoughts fleeting in and out so quickly that it felt as if I wasn't really thinking, just experiencing the sight fluidly. \n\nOnce, following a suggestion from an artist I knew, I bought a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had longed to learn drawing since I was six, and this book covered everything from understanding a pencil to how the brain interprets lines. One method it taught was to use a square frame to focus on any picture, simplifying a complex scene—like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room—into a more manageable image, just the fruit on a simple surface.\n\nAt that moment, staring at the bowl before me, I couldn't mentally apply the artist’s frame. I was too overwhelmed, too struck with awe, only able to stand and marvel. Picasso had his blue period, Monet adored greenery, and the Italian Renaissance masters reveled in a spectrum of colors. If I fancied my viewpoint to be worthy of the title \"Artistic,\" then the scene before me was the inception of my piece, my story, Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers touched my chosen tool of creativity, muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand moved, my mind's intent taking shape in what might have been my most creative moment.

            "Teen fatalities in car accidents are a growing concern. Various factors contribute to this alarming trend among the youngest drivers in America. According to the National Institutes of Health, one issue is that teenagers' brains are not fully developed to handle the dangers of driving. Additionally, their lack of experience greatly contributes to the problem, leading to more fatal crashes, increased instances of rollovers, speeding, and veering off the road. Teenagers are particularly at risk when driving with peers, a common occurrence. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a link between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents. \n\nTo address this, California and other states have introduced provisional licenses that limit driving hours and restrict other minors from being passengers. However, these measures are temporary solutions. The fundamental problem is that young drivers, as a group, are statistically unable to manage driving risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman suggests that even at 18, individuals may be too young for a standard driver's license. His research, cited by USA Today, indicates that people under 19-20 often seek risky experiences for excitement. It would be logical to postpone driving until this thrill-seeking tendency diminishes. Issuing licenses to young teens could lead to even more deadly accidents, potentially increasing fatalities as more Baby Boomer offspring become eligible to drive by 2010.\n\nLegislation to address this could be relatively simple. Schools could continue offering driver's education to prepare future drivers, but no one under 18 should drive. A provisional permit could still be issued before a full license, requiring a set number of driving hours, similar to existing state requirements (such as California's six hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours with an adult). Since teen driving fatalities are a nationwide issue, uniform national legislation would be an effective way to safeguard teenagers across the country. This proposal is not a new concept.",
            "This document explores three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with a concise definition of the disorder, followed by an explanation of the diagnosis process, highlighting common characteristics or \"red flags.\" The paper concludes by discussing how teachers in mainstream classrooms can support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), pertains to how efficiently and effectively the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. More specifically, (C)AP involves the CNS's perceptual processing of auditory information and the neurobiological activity that supports this processing, which results in electrophysiologic auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it is a disorder where the brain struggles to process auditory inputs correctly. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally and are not considered \"hearing impaired\"; rather, the brain area responsible for interpreting auditory information, such as distinguishing words or separating conversation from background noise, does not function as expected.\n\nThe earliest reference to what is now known as CAPD dates back to the mid-1950s under the term \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), during research on children with communication disorders. The Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954. In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and developed a model to explain the physiology of the central auditory nervous system (CANS) related to dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 sparked further research into CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways: individuals may struggle to locate or perceive sound spatially, have difficulty distinguishing between multiple sounds, fail to recognize sound patterns, or be unable to detect changes in speech tone (such as sarcasm). Sounds may be masked by subsequent sounds, there may be an inability to synthesize auditory clues meaningfully, and there might be difficulty identifying the sequence of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves screening through \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,\" which can be conducted by audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and other professionals using various measures to assess auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires, surveys, and observations of auditory behaviors, such as the patient's responses to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single tool or test with consistently high diagnostic success, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Many tests present the patient with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and require them to differentiate certain items, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the corresponding responses.",

These experiences motivated me to earn a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Still unsure of my career direction, I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, a visit to a friend introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy seeking refuge from abusive parents. The next day, when he contacted the police regarding his home situation, I visited his parents' house to see if I could assist. I shared my concerns with the police, mentioning my recent psychology degree, and they asked me to speak with the parents since legal action could not be taken for the teenager. In questioning the parents, they appeared anxious and offered excuses, describing their son's actions as manipulative in involving outsiders for what they called \"simple\" family disputes. This experience made me seriously consider a career in social work to assist children facing \"simple\" family conflicts.\n\nSocial justice is another crucial value in social work. While society professes the importance of the individual and mourns those we lose, it often values conformity over genuine individuality. If society truly values the individual, why do we strive to be like everyone else? I consider myself an individual and resist conforming to societal norms. Throughout high school and college, I opposed social injustice through various means, such as dyeing my hair unconventional colors, wearing clothes that reflected my personality, getting multiple ear piercings, participating in GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and standing against racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. I am committed to social justice and will continue to challenge social injustices.",
            "This paper examines the Biological and Sociocultural models as they pertain to insomnia. The biological model emphasizes inherited genetic traits and medical health factors. In contrast, the Sociocultural model considers environmental interactions and their relevance to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The review analyzes research on insomnia, clarifying how each study relates to and enhances the understanding of these models, while also assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the findings.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified as primary disorders, those linked to another mental disorder, or those associated with other conditions. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, whereas disorders related to mental health are connected to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorders might arise from medical issues or substance use. Dyssomnias comprise Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves challenges in achieving or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia involves difficulty staying awake, both persisting for at least a month. Narcolepsy is characterized by cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. While Dyssomnias focus on sleep onset and maintenance, Parasomnias involve behavioral or physiological abnormalities during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Disorders linked to other mental health issues involve sleep disturbances caused by Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Intellectual Disabilities). This review centers on insomnia, with a partial focus on primary sleep disorders, in relation to biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genetic, hereditary, and physiological aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus that contain orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. Research on mice demonstrated that GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are crucial for sleep/wake regulation. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, and inhibiting it may reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist baclofen was shown to increase sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that results from animal studies may be applicable to humans, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. Issues with this receptor could impair sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if such a phenotype is inherited, it could disrupt sleep naturally, adversely affecting areas like education, employment, and daily tasks requiring concentration.",
            "I have been attending University Park for approximately two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many students, myself included. During my freshman year, I was assigned a dorm room in East Halls, which is nearly at the easternmost edge of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my residence at Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes, especially during the frequent inclement weather in State College. An alum, not much older than me, shared that in the past, East Halls were separated from the rest of the university by vast stretches of unused land. Nowadays, that space has been developed with sports fields, large new buildings such as the new Creamery and health services building, and is surrounded by apartments. As our campus continues to grow, moving around becomes increasingly difficult. What is the best way to tackle this mobility issue? On a college campus, it's the bicycle. However, simply having bikes isn't enough. Students need to use them, and the campus infrastructure must cater to cyclists' needs.\n\nI recently spoke to a friend who started cycling again after several years. He remarked that he wondered why he ever stopped, saying, “Bikes are great. For a while, it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” Besides being beneficial for health, cycling is the most efficient mode of transport. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical effort can take you 30 miles or more. Like many other undergraduates, I now live off-campus, at a distance comparable to some dorms from the campus center. The smartest choice I made this year was buying a bike. I have a class in the Thomas building daily, which is a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Biking can reduce that time to just 5 minutes if I ride fast enough. The only issue is that Pollock Road, the most direct route to the Thomas building from my house, can be challenging to travel on, whether by bike or on foot. Walking has its advantages, but personally, I’m too busy to walk. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable way to get to class. Walking to Thomas every day would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day, totaling over two and a half hours each week. This doesn't include all the additional time I'd spend walking to other classes and appointments. That's more time than I can afford to lose.",
            "In \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley critiques the looming dangers of technology and the capitalist framework that supports it by depicting a dystopian society. In this society, individuals prioritize community over personal identity and are conditioned from birth to seek immediate gratification above all else. The citizens are mere instruments in a larger scheme, restricted to a single ideology as directed by the World Controller. A Marxist analysis of the novel reveals Huxley's underlying concerns about the growth of these systems. Marxist concepts like homogeny and reification help underscore that Huxley's work critiques the flaws in the emerging economy of his era.\n\nCapitalism is mocked using the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where ordinary people are kept from understanding their true economic relationships with other classes because they are focused on personal gain. This is attributed to the ideological control over the proletariat and common laborers, clearly demonstrated by the conditioning in \"Brave New World.\" The lower classes, such as Delta and Gamma, lack true autonomy; hypnopaedia enforces their desire to consume and indulge above all else, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, the domination of social classes by another group, is evident here. The lower classes are unaware of this manipulation, literally buying into an ideology that sustains capitalist and consumerist structures. The upper classes, born with awareness, largely do nothing; few Alphas or Betas, like Bernard, challenge their roles. The interactions between social classes highlight the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" authentic relationships between individuals do not exist. The novel intentionally avoids distinguishing its characters, even major ones, who lack depth. Huxley may be suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism strips individuals of free will and self-expression. Love and extreme emotions are absent, with interactions remaining superficial, as shown by male characters' comments on women's physical traits and women's candid discussions about their encounters. Additionally, each class's acceptance of its position in the hierarchy reflects the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their complete compliance with their societal role illustrates Marxist views on the proletariat, falsely assured of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform with their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. A major topic of intense debate in the class was whether Islam is a hostile religion. I feel that this question is even more pertinent today than it was before. Reflecting on the events since 9/11, I have seen the mass media shift from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme form of tolerance for Islam in America. I doubt that back in 2001, we would have ever seen a presidential candidate with the name Barack Obama, who has a clear Muslim heritage in his family.\n\nThe Prophet's biography fascinates me because, based on what I know of Muhammad's history, it seems to contradict his personality. From my past knowledge and learning, I believed that Muhammad compelled conversions to Islam. He would conquer tribes and then force them to adopt Islam. However, according to the biography, Muhammad is portrayed as a sort of martyr, misunderstood and humble before others, after which people gradually came to acknowledge the 'truth' in his teachings and sought him out.\n\nAdditionally, there are striking similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad. Most notably, he multiplied mutton and milk to feed more than forty men. This style of writing suggests that the authors wanted Muhammad to be seen as a humble prophet who needed no validation, living simply in truth and miracles. This kind of portrayal is problematic because it diminishes the miracles and life of Jesus Christ. To me, it seems like they are trying to take credit for Jesus's life and identity through Muhammad.\n\nMoreover, the biography contains numerous stories suggesting that part of its aim is to provide evidence of how people supposedly 'independently' converted to Islam. However, many stories are from at least a third-party perspective, with the author describing information as heard from someone who heard from someone else, and so on. I found this troubling because, even though their intention was to provide proof of the stories' truth, it seemed to undermine the stories and make them more suspicious.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is how they attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. Yet, history contradicts the notion of Muhammad as a gentle and humble man, and I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus were quickly set aside as Christian thought developed after his life. Looking at history broadly, Christianity appears to have diverged significantly from its origins. In today's world, there is a growing awareness and a strong progressive trend. While traditionalists remain and resist thinking beyond what they've been taught, they may not be influential enough to sway the entire population. Among Christians, historical awareness is expected to rise significantly in the coming years, sparking a desire to separate the doctrines added over time from the original intentions of Jesus. This process may take decades or centuries, but it seems inevitable: a significant shift in Christian history will occur, reverting back to its original form. A movement will grow, peeling away layers of doctrine until only the essence of what Jesus introduced remains. When this trend spreads across the United States and Europe, encouraging people to worship as if they were living during Jesus' time, the church as an institution will continue to lead. However, as the theological landscape shifts backward, the diversity within Christianity will give way to increased uniformity in belief and practice. Instead of differences, there will be growing similarities between regions, denominations, and divisions. History is full of such reversions; for example, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, yet that empire later became a Christian institution. Similarly, the country moved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The forthcoming reversion will unfold within Christianity, seeking its roots and reducing diversity. An essential part of this process will be interpreting Jesus’ words metaphorically rather than literally. So, what happened since Jesus' time? Looking back in history, we find only Judaism, the theological foundation for Christianity. Monotheism, the idea of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion by the time Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish community was not unified, with divisions among Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of common people.",
            "I think The Jungle demonstrates that humans are inherently greedy and self-centered, primarily looking out for their own interests and improving their lives, without concern for those below them. The book illustrates this in several ways, notably through the owners and managers of large factories. Their sole focus is on expanding their businesses, without regard for anyone or anything that might suffer due to their progress. Upton Sinclair's description highlights the environmental harm caused by pollution: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair aims to portray the significant damage this smoke causes, showing how the factory owners ignore the impact on people and animals. They disregard the smoke clouds from their factories and the waste runoff from the numerous pens in Packingtown. \n\nThe factory owners and managers were indifferent to the plight of their workers who toiled to enrich them. They would go to any lengths to increase their profits, as illustrated by the notion that \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Employees endured terrible working hours and could be laid off in large numbers without notice, compensation, or assistance in finding new jobs. During the period in which The Jungle is set, there were few, if any, laws or regulations to protect workers' safety or welfare. This lack of oversight allowed managers and owners to exploit their workforce, demanding increased productivity under harsh conditions. Although not stated explicitly, the book suggests that those living and working in Packingtown were expected to endure poor conditions both at work and in their living environment. There were no organizations to inform or assist the workers. While unions existed, they often exploited the workers instead of helping them, profiting from their struggles. The workers were treated so poorly, with no escape from the Packingtown system, that they were likened to slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is considered by Edgar Allan Poe to be one of his finer poems. In it, he uses the term \"Thulé\" twice, in lines 6 and 56, a reference that Mabbott links back to Virgil. Virgil mentioned Thulé as an island north of Britain, which the Greeks believed to be the boundary of the known world. While Virgil indeed used this term, there is also a more contemporary source that deserves attention—Poe's interest in German authors. This connection is significant as it highlights Poe's familiarity with Goethe's works. In his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" Karl J. Arndt discusses the similarities between Poe's and Goethe's poems, suggesting that Poe was influenced by Goethe.\n\nThe \"Oxford Companion to English Literature\" notes that Goethe was renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts, with the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of his death. In the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem narrates the story of a king who, after his wife's death, becomes consumed by grief and drinking. He eventually decides to die, passing his possessions to his children, except for a goblet his wife gave him. He throws the goblet into the ocean and dies on a cliff. The somber mood of \"The King of Thulé\" mirrors the portrayal of the king in \"Dream-Land,\" possibly reflecting Poe's own experiences of loss and reliance on alcohol. Additionally, \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, just before Poe used the term Thulé in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe references Thulé twice in his works: once using \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a dark and lonely Thulé, haunted by memories of dead friends and a colorless world. These themes resonate with Goethe's \"The King of Thulé,\" where the king, grieving his wife's death, becomes desolate and loses his will to live. It is as if the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" is stepping into the world of Goethe’s poem.\n\nGoethe was a significant author whom Poe would have been aware of, partly due to his admiration for Tennyson. Poe's exposure to Goethe’s works would have been likely, given their widespread reproductions following their original publication.",
            "In California, could a customer injured by slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be granted punitive damages if the store manager acted with malice, having been informed twice about the spill but neglecting to clean it for 30 minutes due to being on a dinner break? A judge might not immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To justify such a claim, the plaintiff must show that the defendant acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm their actions could cause and that the behavior was despicable. Palmer could argue that Martin should have been aware of the potential harm from not cleaning the spill, given that several D&D customers had been injured from similar incidents in the preceding months. Despite this awareness, he still failed to address the spill. While Palmer's claim that Martin's actions were despicable is less convincing, it is still reasonable considering that six slip-and-fall accidents occurred in 2009, yet Martin did not take the necessary steps to ensure store safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed his manager, Paul Martin, of an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin, on his dinner break, replied that he \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin of the spill, receiving the same response. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill and suffered a severe back injury. Before Palmer’s accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the claim for punitive damages.\n\nIn California, punitive damages can be recovered for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice,\" according to Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Malice is defined as conduct intended to cause harm, or if there is no intent, the conduct must be \"despicable\" and done with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others,\" as per § (c)(1). Courts have deemed conduct malicious when done with a conscious disregard for the plaintiff’s rights, recognizing the likely dangerous outcomes of the conduct and willfully failing to prevent those outcomes.

            "She had always felt as though something was missing in her life. This insatiable yearning began when she was around 14, just stepping into her teenage years, and persisted even at 17. Over time, she realized she craved someone, not something. However, she hadn't felt drawn to any boys. Some tried to court her, awkwardly attempting to win over someone seemingly uninterested, yet none captured her attention. She frequently pondered this peculiar feeling, trying to understand why it was happening to her. Despite years of reflection leading to various theories, none were convincing enough for her to entertain seriously. So she continued living, always questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was typically serene. Her parents were calm and kind, rarely arguing with each other and seldom with her. Their only disagreements revolved around her expression of independence and free spirit. Although she was the child of a tranquil couple, her vibrant and lively personality contrasted with theirs, making her very likable due to her kindness.\n\nToday, however, was different. As she wandered from room to room seeking inspiration, she heard a sudden scream from the kitchen, her mother's melodic voice. Panicking, she rushed in, exclaiming, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the floor, clearly in pain, repeatedly gasping \"Ow.\" Her daughter hurried to her side, trying to help. \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need you to take me to... the hospital,\" her mother uttered, her words strained and hurried, conveying her severe discomfort. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up,\" she responded. Guided by her mother, she managed to carry her, thankful for the strength she had gained from classes. She placed her mother in the back of the car and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital visit was filled with the smells of disinfectant and illness, mixed with anxiety. But she wasn't focused on that, her mind was occupied with aiding her mother. She swiftly carried her inside and called for medical assistance. Concerned faces gathered, and someone quickly brought a rolling bed, laying her mother on it. They took her away for immediate medical attention, leaving her daughter to anxiously wait.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a step stool while attempting to retrieve a vase from their highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke-related deaths. The aMed diet is an adapted form of the Med diet, characterized by increased intake of plant-based foods like plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (as opposed to saturated fats), and fish, while reducing the consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective research found an inverse relationship between Med diet adherence and the risk of overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, and an intervention study revealed that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in obese individuals. Previous studies did not specifically address stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without prior CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score on six occasions using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) to evaluate nutrient intake over the previous year. Over 95% of nurses continued their participation throughout the 20-year duration. FFQs were validated through studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified by reviewing medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, incidents were classified as \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions categorized this way. For each FFQ, body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated, and from 1986 onward, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation for individuals and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were computed (averaging scores from the previous two years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that might skew results) by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard models were employed to evaluate the association between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as shown by a greater aMed diet score, was linked to a reduced risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, there were 2,391 new cases of CHD, 1,763 new cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (including fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The sign reads, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\"\n\nEllen Page, known for her role in Juno, is standing by herself on a street corner, holding up a piece of cardboard with this disturbing message written in Sharpie. Burma, also referred to as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a repressive military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, the country saw a series of street protests, the first in a decade. These demonstrations, led by many Burmese monks, were dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution\" in reference to the color of the monks' robes. Initially, the general public began to support the protests, and while the government initially tolerated the monks' peaceful gatherings, the situation soon escalated into a violent conflict between the monks and the junta. The military began storming and looting monasteries nationwide. Foreign journalists were detained and jailed immediately, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed on September 27, 2007, just for being at a protest. Although the official death count stands at 13, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army just before the report was released, claimed, \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThis is not a new phenomenon. While these are some recent examples of global atrocities, the tendency of governments to suppress opposition and maintain total control has existed as long as civilization. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine selection to rule every aspect of society. Japanese emperors were believed to be gods themselves, sent to lead their people to prosperity, with Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri being part of their influence. Meanwhile, our current president, George W. Bush, regularly consults with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subgroup of the Republic Party.\n\nNotable examples of such governmental actions include the June 4, 1989, protest in Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students protested against authoritarian rule. The death toll for this event varies significantly, with Chinese government reports citing 200-300 deaths, while the Chinese Red Cross reported between 2,000-3,000 deaths. Another example is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias, supported by the Rwandan government, systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of ethnicity. Hitler's \"Third Reich,\" encompassing several years and countries, involved the mass murder of people of Jewish descent and stands as another extreme instance.",
            "Duke Ellington's impact on jazz is largely rooted in his long career and his exceptional talent in shaping his orchestra. While his piano presence is understated in many compositions chosen for this task, Ellington's prowess as a composer shines through his ability to craft intricate and layered pieces that highlight his band members' individual talents. He provided a framework for soloists to improvise freely while also composing tightly orchestrated pieces that leveraged the unique styles of his musicians to bring out musical themes. This approach allowed him to emphasize the overall tone of the orchestra, producing coherent and unique sounds tailored to each piece. Ellington's understanding of each player's sound and their role within the ensemble enabled him to create some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, when discussing Ellington's sound and innovation, cites \"Creole Love Call\" as an example of his use of voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This piece showcases Ellington's early use of voice to add texture and color without lyrics. \"Creole Love Call\" also highlights Ellington's ability to complement his soloists' styles, a trait evident throughout his career. The piece is a slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues with six choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A call and response between voice and reeds, starting smooth and melodic, and ending with a rougher tone.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that builds on the basic melody and emphasizes extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, where the reeds initiate the call and response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: Returns to the structure of the first chorus, with a call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice uses a \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: A brief tag with a vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending.\n\nEllington's use of voice to enhance the tonal color in this piece exemplifies a stylistic trait prevalent in his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington merges his skill in tight orchestration with his sensitivity to tone color. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing blends Miley's vocal-like trumpet playing with Cox's instrumental vocal qualities to create a rich and complementary sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" expands on these ideas, with Ellington effectively utilizing Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a key member of his orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the specific ways they do? Are there any limitations or constraints that affect the path of evolutionary change? In 1917, D’Arcy Thompson remarked that \"even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" and this observation still holds true today. Recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to broader aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis across both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research aims to investigate how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, along with experimental studies, can clarify the mechanisms behind the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental change. We utilized X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters for modeling both hypothetical and actual skeletal shapes. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We created models of hypothetical shell shapes to interpret the limits of possible morphological change in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to enhance our understanding of macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be considered a structure that acts as a tube traveling over time through 360 degrees of space. The revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are termed whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which the whorls grow can vary, and each whorl is separated by a continuous line called a suture. Typically, the largest whorl of a shell is the last one, known as the body whorl. The spire includes all whorls except the last, with the apex being the tip of the spire and the opposite end referred to as the base. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed in apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. (The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex pointing upwards.)\n\nThe following method is used for counting whorls. First, view the shell from the apical perspective and identify where the first suture begins. Then, draw a line dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line, estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. It is possible to trace the aperture's path using the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture, as well as the horizontal and vertical radii of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented both graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical formulation is established, it becomes possible to adjust parameters and alter the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Over the past decade, the neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia have shown little change. Although the country is progressing towards achieving several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, the advancements in child and maternal health are insufficient to meet the 2015 targets. The reasons for these gaps will be explored further, highlighting the need to bolster the health system rather than merely implementing programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made strides in ensuring that more births are attended by skilled health workers, with 72% now achieving this benchmark. However, this figure includes traditional practitioners like midwives who cannot perform medical interventions in complicated pregnancies, contributing to a high rate of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. Thus, the progress in this area is somewhat deceptive, and significant work remains. Furthermore, there has been a decrease in the proportion of children under five receiving professional treatment for diarrhea. Although postnatal care data is incomplete, it is evident that care rates remain low nationwide.\n\nCesarean section rates remain lower than expected, at roughly 4%. This statistic highlights another issue: while urban areas report a 7% c-section rate, rural areas see only 2%, indicating inequitable healthcare coverage across the country. Access is primarily concentrated in urban regions. Additionally, vertical equity is a concern, with a 27% disparity in service utilization between the poorest and richest groups, suggesting that financial barriers hinder the poor from accessing healthcare.\n\nIn contemplating the next steps to enhance neonatal and maternal care indicators, the fundamental question is how best to tackle service deficiencies. Should Indonesia focus on specific programmatic initiatives or strengthen the overall health system without emphasizing pre and post-pregnancy care? Program-specific approaches are appealing due to their targeted, manageable objectives and generally quicker results. However, these approaches have significant drawbacks. Investing heavily in one health sector area can lead to reduced funding and resources for others, as seen with international funding for HIV/AIDS affecting the family planning sector. Moreover, running multiple parallel programs leads to redundant and uncoordinated services, resulting in increased paperwork and supply management challenges.",
            "Over the last century, the classification of Popular Music has expanded to such an extent that listing all its genres has become quite challenging. Adding to the complexity, almost all genres—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—have given rise to numerous sub-genres and even sub-sub-genres. Notably, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has emerged as one of the most varied and expressive genres in popular music over the past forty years. It is expressive due to its ability to convey a wide array of emotions, though it often leans towards darker themes. It is also diverse, as people quickly realized the genre's flexibility shortly after its inception, leading them to create their own sub-genres and further subdivide those, continuing the trend to the present day.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal scene has diversified into so many niche groups that pinpointing the exact definition of heavy metal is difficult. It has absorbed numerous elements from other genres, yet, like all things, it originated from somewhere. To truly comprehend the metal music that is prevalent today, one must first grasp what the metal movement entails and why it is considered a movement rather than merely a genre.\n\nIn many respects, metal is a movement characterized by darkness. It's often described as \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more aggression, more theatricality. There's less primitivism and more technical skill, as metal musicians are typically very proficient with their instruments, which is evident in their music. Additionally, metal is, unsurprisingly, a movement heavily influenced by drugs. The psychedelic drug surge in the mid-1970s led to people creating wild, otherworldly records, using drugs as a catalyst for their creativity. It exhibits numerous dark, visceral qualities, a stark contrast to much of the popular music that lacked these darker emotional elements. Later generations of metal have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral aspects that were prominent during the Romantic Era. Lyrics from songs like \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles illustrate this darkness, representing the emotional highs and lows, possibly influenced by drugs. This song is considered by some as one of the early Heavy Metal tracks and was a response to a darker, heavier Rolling Stones song. The Beatles aimed to prove they could match the heaviness of the Stones, so they included it on \"The White Album.\"",
            "Several decades before Surrealist artists started creating their dreamlike imagery, Henri Rousseau was meticulously crafting his own visions, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only depicts a woman marveling at the wonders of a dreamt land but also symbolizes Rousseau's personal ambitions as an artist. From the beginning of his career, he aspired for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from his peers and art enthusiasts, facing a challenging internal conflict to achieve these goals. The Dream best encapsulates Rousseau's lifelong struggle between adhering to or emulating certain artistic styles to gain acceptance in the esteemed art world he admired and maintaining his creative independence and originality.\n\nTo understand The Dream from this angle, it's essential to know some of Rousseau's background. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Henri Rousseau's father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed middle-class prosperity (Shattuck 47). Rousseau did not receive formal art training; instead, he worked for France's municipal toll service until the age of forty, earning the mistaken title of douanier, or customs inspector (Shattuck 46). After losing his first wife, Clémence, and eight of their infant children, Rousseau was left with his daughter, Julia, and profound grief (Shattuck 49). Seeking solace, he turned to painting for comfort and a new beginning. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized peasants in their art, Rousseau was fundamentally a folk painter with the aspirations of an average person from his social class.\n\nRousseau's strong desire for acceptance in the art world is understandable when viewed in context: he lacked formal art education, started his career later in life, and created art alongside many other talented, well-known modern artists. Despite years of work, Rousseau only began receiving proper recognition for his art around the same time Matisse was establishing his artistic reputation. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes that although Rousseau and Matisse were technically competitors, they differed not only in style and subject but also in their motivations for painting: \"Matisse was a painter who feared painting in a clichéd way, while Rousseau aimed to create art so conventional that he would be accepted by the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "Many influential thinkers have suggested a deep link between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. I think there's a fundamental reason for this connection. As John Keats expresses in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” We acquire much of our knowledge through education or experience. Yet, as Keats hints, we seem to understand ethics and aesthetics instinctively, rather than through traditional learning. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than dictate. Our exploration of morality and beauty primarily seeks to explain why a piece of art or a deed is beautiful or moral, instead of providing a checklist for evaluating or creating good art or ethical actions.\n\nMoreover, critiques of art or morals never fully capture the essence of what makes something good or beautiful. Discussions about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on aspects like composition, contrast, or cultural significance, but these don't explain why it's great art. Often, when describing a favorite artwork or literary piece, people say, \"There's just something about it\" before offering a more detailed critique. I believe that neither art nor morals can be entirely reduced to a list of their features. As Flannery O'Connor notes, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” Even with a thorough description of a literary work, something transcendent remains. I think ethics shares this quality. As Wittgenstein states, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.” I propose that this \"something,\" this indefinable quality, is the most potent aspect of art and morality, and it is this transcendent nature that links ethics and aesthetics.\n\nI believe that morality and art are closely connected because we experience both on a level that is felt rather than fully articulated, aligning with Kantian ideas of the noumenal. This connection is even more pronounced with literature. As McKean observes, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Modern Germany is seen as a powerful and unified nation, with a distinct culture stretching from the Alps' shadows in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This cultural uniqueness is also evident from Cologne along the Rhine River, through central Germany, to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. It's no wonder that contemporary Germany is a fusion of various sources and tribes.\n\nThe ancient region known as Germania is the ancestral home of the Germans, though the origin of the name is a topic of debate among scholars and historians. Tacitus suggested that the name derived from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were referred to as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and fought the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first mentioned the term “Germanus” in his account of the Gallic Wars, using it to differentiate between the Gauls he had conquered and the Germanic tribes he had not, borrowing the term from the Gauls themselves. Some believe the name referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter of his initial book on these wars, Caesar noted, “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others argue the name might derive from the spear, known as a ger, used in warfare (O.E.D, 2010), or from the Old Irish word garim, meaning “to shout,” suggesting the Germans were loud or noisy (Names of Germany).\n\nTacitus, an early Roman historian, wrote in AD 98's “De Origine et situ Germanorum” about the German origins, stating, “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive... Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nWhy would anyone leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans at that time. They would occasionally send expeditions into Germania for resources and conduct land campaigns, but they mostly returned to their vast empire. As Germanic tribes began emerging in the mid-first century, they lived on the Roman Empire's borders, trading goods from their lands and serving as soldiers in the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "The play Twelfth Night suggests that while disguise can be effective for prolonged deception, a person must eventually abandon this false identity to avoid losing themselves entirely. However, ending such deception can lead to feelings of alienation. Ultimately, one must choose between self-preservation and maintaining relationships with others. Some may react indifferently to being deceived, but others may take offense at the pretense. Deception involving gender role reversal is especially complex, raising questions about why someone might abandon their identity to adopt that of the opposite gender. In Viola's situation, disguising herself as a man is a means of self-protection: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Newly arrived in an unfamiliar land, Viola finds it necessary to pose as a man to safeguard herself from potential threats. While her plan succeeds, it also isolates her from other women, severing a vital support network. Compounding the issue, Viola is so convincing as a man that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, Viola grapples with unspoken romantic feelings toward Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261). To contemporary readers, Twelfth Night might demonstrate how deception can reveal hidden emotions, particularly for Olivia and Orsino. Some passages suggest that these characters might have unvoiced subconscious desires that Viola/Cesario's presence compels them to confront. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario seems male, or does she secretly have feelings for women? It seems unlikely since Shakespeare's Olivia appears to satirize those who judge others solely on appearance. This is shown by how easily Olivia transfers her affection from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to view Cesario/Viola as family rather than a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "Various observers have highlighted the harshness of German colonial rule, particularly concerning the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, describing an entire colonial empire with such a simplistic view would be misleading. The German colonial empire's policies and governance were as diverse as its geographical expanse. Similarly, educational opportunities varied across the colonies. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a significant number of educated and literate Africans. German efforts in education in Kamerun and other colonies received acclaim from contemporary writers. \n\nIn contrast, the situation in South West Africa (now Namibia) was markedly different. Unlike East Africa, where the government established state schools and actively participated in the education of the natives, in South West Africa, native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies with minimal government support. However, the government did allocate substantial resources for the education of Europeans, creating state schools and providing greater support and regulation for missionary schools. These educational strategies had long-term impacts on South West Africa, persisting even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies had significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to South West Africa's differing experience. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors and highlight new research on settlers' and colonial authorities' attitudes towards native Africans.\n\nThere is extensive literature focused specifically on education within the German colonial empire. Most of these works, written in German, date back to the early twentieth century, during or shortly after German colonial rule. The initial aim of these writings was mainly to detail the educational systems in these colonies. Later English-language studies expanded the discussion through comparative analyses of education across different German colonies and more in-depth examinations of specific educational aspects. These studies revealed significant disparities in the educational systems among the colonies. The most notable work directly addressing the topic of this paper is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and explores the factors behind their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa accounts for many of the unique features of its educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonies, South West Africa had a relatively moderate climate, despite much of its territory being arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans resided in South West Africa, while the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa, had only 5,336.",
            "The United States and Mexico once experienced a prolonged rivalry that lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The peak of this conflict was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, acquiring Texas and the American Southwest. Numerous other conflicts occurred between the two countries, eventually diminishing just before World War I. This rivalry was rooted in clashes over significant issues such as religion, culture, tradition, and material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31). \n\nSimilar to many other nations with enduring rivalries, countries sharing borders often have conflicting interests leading to rivalries. The United States and Mexico exemplify this common pattern among neighboring nations. According to David M. Pletcher (1977), \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). These two countries, due to their proximity, have been historical rivals of the United States, whereas other Latin American countries have generally maintained good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences were a significant source of tension between the two nations, a challenge faced by many countries throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). Unlike the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was partly ideological, the U.S.-Mexico tensions were more about religious preferences. This distrust originated from the historical animosity between the English and Spanish, which complicated the establishment of friendly relations between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identify 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry period, mostly involving territorial issues such as border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier problems. Bandit raids from American border towns persisted until both countries applied military force along their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). According to Schmitt (1974), the rivalry began to subside as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and concluded as American goals shifted \"from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p.110) in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was unexpectedly struck by an illness that left me disabled, one I had never heard of before. At that time, I was working as a nurse. I chose nursing because I had a deep-seated need for the safety and security I lacked during my childhood. I often heard the saying, \"You'll always have a job because people will always get sick,\" as I grew up. Despite my dreams of becoming a scientist or a journalist—or perhaps both—I pursued a career in nursing.\n\nHowever, at 46, I found myself single, with no substantial savings, and unable to work. I remain disabled and after 15 years relying on Social Security Disability, I have virtually nothing to call my own. I manage to get by, but each day is a challenge that threatens my security, safety, and self-esteem. While nothing in my life feels certain now, I do know one thing: I couldn't have survived all these years without the support of my family and a few good friends, no matter how strong I thought I was. When true disaster hits, strength feels elusive.\n\nThe truth is, life is full of emergencies, both big and small. There are no guarantees, and some challenges are too overwhelming to handle alone, regardless of how prepared one might be. I completely agree that in the U.S., we need to stop relying solely on the government, which is clearly faltering. Instead, I would prefer to see Americans learning to trust and help one another again, rather than each of us building individual fallout shelters.\n\nConservatives in the U.S. often speak about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country; however, it was actually compassion, mutual respect, and resource-sharing that sustained our forefathers during tough times. The pioneers who traveled across the Rockies in wagon trains didn't reach the West Coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, absolutely, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting with duct tape for the windows in case of a biological attack. I also have various flashlights, plenty of batteries, numerous candles, waterproof matches, and canned food. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and can preserve your own food, do it. It's a great idea, as is having a wood stove, provided you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're preparing, take the time to get to know your neighbors.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he gave up worldly pursuits, attained enlightenment, and his teachings eventually gave rise to Buddhism. The most traditional branch of this religion is called Theravada Buddhism. Buddhism is approximately 2,500 years old, and it has evolved since the time of Buddha. This evolution is evident in various places, such as Sri Lanka, a Theravada Buddhist nation, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is held. Both monks and laypeople engage in this ceremony, which holds some religious importance, even though Buddha never mentioned such festivities. These changes are evident in the superficial practices and the fundamental beliefs of the religion. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community, including both monastics and laypersons, has had to adapt its doctrinal principles due to various influences, both from within and outside the community, and both beneficial and detrimental.\n\nSeveral key terms will be frequently used in this discussion. There is the distinction between internal and external forces. An internal force arises from members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of whether they are monastics. An external force originates from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is one that harms or intends to harm the Buddhist community, stemming from a negative view of Buddhism. A benign force neither aims to help nor harm the community, though it might inadvertently do either. These terms will be referenced often throughout the discussion.\n\nTo begin, it's important to explore the fundamental aspects of the religion—the core doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma primarily consists of the Tripitaka, or the \"three baskets,\" of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka includes the rules of discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. The metaphysical ideas include Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (the inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (the impermanence of everything). Understanding these concepts is essential to end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which occurs continuously. With the end of Sansara, one also ends lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) upon achieving enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for living. Laypeople follow five precepts: abstaining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and taking intoxicants. Monks follow many more disciplinary rules. The most fundamental doctrinal concept in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. The first is Dukkha, the truth that life is suffering. The second is that attachment causes suffering. The third is that suffering can be overcome."
