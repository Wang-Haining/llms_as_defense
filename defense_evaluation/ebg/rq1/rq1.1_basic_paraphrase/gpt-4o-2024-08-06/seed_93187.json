            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture has a crucial influence on negotiations. It can be defined both by what it is and what it is not, as well as its implications. Culture is diverse and cannot be pigeonholed into being a single, uniform entity. Generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are overly simplistic and broad. While understanding cultural stereotypes can be helpful, it is more beneficial for a negotiator to grasp how a specific culture relates to the negotiation context and how its attitudes might impact discussions. When encountering a different culture, people often relate it to their own, leading to inevitable comparisons.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset may involve exploring its history and recognizing its biases. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, it is essential to accept it as it is and work within its framework, particularly in negotiations, especially if one holds a weaker position. Similarly, when negotiating in a foreign setting, respecting local traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and advance the negotiation process.\n\nIt's important to remember that culture isn't limited to national or international distinctions. Companies within a country often develop their own corporate cultures. For example, some companies might emphasize long work hours, while others prefer a more relaxed schedule. Corporate culture manifests in employee dress codes, communication styles (e.g., direct vs. indirect), and hiring practices. Some companies promote philanthropy broadly, while others limit it to approved charities or events. The variety in American corporate culture from one company to another (and even within different regions or environments) showcases the diversity of thought within a societal culture. Other cultures might appear more uniform, but this similarity suggests a need for deeper exploration.\n\nUnderstanding values is crucial because they explain the reasons behind a culture's behavior. If a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superior to succeed. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that values aggressive bargaining may not rush to settle. Considering these generalities is important before negotiations begin. However, it is also beneficial for a negotiator to learn about their counterpart personally to enhance the negotiation's effectiveness.",
            "The phrase “The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God’” is first found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and serves as the starting point for St. Anselm’s argument about the existence of God. Thomas Aquinas, another thinker we will explore, seemingly shares this belief. Since both of their arguments support the same idea, and our task is to assess which is more compelling, we will, for the sake of conciseness, assume they are both correct in their belief in the existence of the Biblical God. Considering a different type of deity would prevent a fair comparison of their arguments, as their defense is centered on a specific concept of God. Nonetheless, I propose that although each presents valid points, neither offers a complete rationale for belief in God.\n\nTo clarify this, we will first look at St. Anselm’s basic argument. Anselm suggests gaining understanding through faith, looking inward to find evidence of God. He argues that since God exists in our understanding, we cannot truly conceive of His nonexistence. Though his explanation can be complex and difficult to follow, the essence is that proof of God is within our minds. Anselm implies that we need not search beyond our own soul to find truth about God; this being’s existence is affirmed by examining what we inherently know to be true within ourselves. External evidence is seemingly unnecessary. This idea of accepting something without undeniable empirical evidence is often called faith in Christian texts.\n\nThis notion contrasts with St. Thomas Aquinas’s view. Aquinas argues that God’s existence can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, without relying on faith. This idea would aid evangelism, a key aspect of Christianity, by allowing the conversion of new believers through logic alone, without needing them to accept unproven beliefs. St. Thomas presents five logical arguments for God’s existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each case, he essentially shows that God’s existence is a logical necessity. If you know a puzzle is missing one piece and assemble the rest, logic allows you to deduce the features and existence of the missing piece without seeing it.",
            "Authors often employ a variety of techniques to evoke specific emotions or attitudes toward significant themes in their work, with some methods proving more effective than others. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes several such techniques. He sometimes combines an unusual adjective with a noun to create a distinct atmosphere around a topic. Alternatively, he attributes meaning to symbols and uses them to achieve the same effect. One prominent technique involves the symbolic use of colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. Fitzgerald assigns particular meanings to these colors, notably white/gray and red/pink, and later uses these meanings to evoke feelings related to key objects in the narrative.\n\nThe meanings attached to white/gray suggest uniformity, with white representing elegance and higher social standing, while gray implies age and fading. Fitzgerald establishes these meanings early in the novel by frequently using both colors. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are consistently associated with \"white\" attire—Daisy and Jordan are \"in white\" (8); Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party; Tom dons a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle; and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). An exception occurs when Nick perceives Gatsby's party, noting that the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further reinforces these associations by applying these colors to mundane subjects: Nick travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names on Nick's timetable are \"gray names\" (61) from Gatsby’s parties, and Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" (28), representing uniformity. Ordinary people and places are described as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), the valley of ashes features \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23), an \"Italian child\" by the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established sufficient meaning for white/gray, he uses them to denote insignificance or uniformity in certain subjects. This color symbolism begins with Daisy. After a lapse in the prominent use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" prompting readers to view her more as a uniform fixture, a mere object of Gatsby’s desire (74). Fitzgerald continues to employ this technique to reinforce Daisy's portrayal as a uniform entity, as seen in references to the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18) and her appearance in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County is highly productive agriculturally, attributed to its mild, sunny climate. Commonly grown crops include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture in the San Diego area is significant, with many local groups having long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also sought after. Numerous organic farms offer tours showcasing their agricultural practices and provide opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. These operations enable landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitats, thus supporting recreational use and offering farm tours and other revenue-generating or educational initiatives.  \n\nBeyond filling a potentially profitable niche, organic farming often promotes greater biodiversity in plant and animal life due to the absence of chemicals in soil and water. However, organic farming can incur higher costs compared to conventional farming. It demands more labor and management to handle pests, weeds, and soil fertilization without chemicals, and losses may be greater than with traditional methods. Additionally, small organic farms lack the economies of scale found in larger operations. Practices that are not directly related to organic farming but that benefit wildlife, such as planting cover crops, rotating grazing, removing invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create specific habitats, can also lead to increased labor costs. Thus, there are multiple reasons why a landowner in this scenario might seek financial support or expertise to maximize both profit and habitat quality.  \n\nThe land chosen for this example is a 160-acre parcel near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It consists of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland near the Cleveland National Forest. It is located in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which is under review and currently considers over a hundred plant and animal species. Many of these species, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, are endangered, while others, like burrowing owls, are declining and may soon be listed.  \n\nThis area was historically inhabited by Native Americans for countless generations and was later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This particular piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many decades. To understand what options a small farmer might have for reducing costs and maintaining wildlife-friendly operations, I selected a property from a real estate website and researched available government programs. I also identified an organic farm in the same region as a model for what someone farming this land might aim to achieve.",
            "There exists a connection between brothers that is unbreakable and unchangeable. Within this connection are a myriad of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, among others. Brothers inherently understand each other more than anyone else with such a bond, seeing themselves in each other. It is in the most critical moments that the true essence of this bond is revealed, whether in a positive or negative light. When these emotions become apparent, they come with significant consequences. To grasp the emotions stemming from this brotherly link, one must confront the outcomes they bring. Looking a brother in the eye and seeing their own reflection allows one to see themselves as they truly are, not as others perceive them. Their true character is found in their actions and the repercussions of those actions. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme and the tumultuous emotions that accompany it. Set against a richly described backdrop, these boys embark on a doomed journey. The climax presents a clash between bitter disappointment and intense pride, with only one brother surviving. This theme is illustrated through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, their interactions, and the narrator's perspective, which conveys the protagonist's complex emotions and his view of the world, both heavily influencing his actions. The protagonist's actions can be attributed to one primary emotion: pride. From the first time he ventures out with his little brother, Doodle, to their final, fateful journey, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He had wished for a brother to share in activities like \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He wanted a companion for racing to Horsehead Landing or sitting atop the great pine behind the barn. Clearly, these dreams were unattainable due to Doodle's frail heart, which made survival uncertain and vigorous physical activities nearly impossible. This realization crushed the young protagonist's fantasies. He even admits to feeling anger towards the fragile child, recalling thoughts of smothering him with a pillow. What kind of child would consider such an act? Yet, his heart softened when the small child smiled at him, a simple gesture that filled the protagonist with hope, indicating his determination was not very strong. Deep down, he had an inherent love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex and imaginative system for processing information. As technology has evolved from simple to sophisticated, the metaphors describing the brain have evolved too. Initially likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, later a book, and now a computer, these metaphors serve as simplified representations. However, it's important to remember that these comparisons have limitations and can lead to misconceptions.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound, or light into electrochemical signals. The brain processes this sensory input through both bottom-up and top-down methods. For instance, when viewing a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing involves assembling basic details such as color, orientation, and borders—where there's a rapid color change—to determine you're seeing a box. Meanwhile, top-down processing uses these initial decisions to speed up recognizing the box, helping you realize it’s a black box rather than a hole in the background.\n\nOnce information is processed to some extent, an attention filter assesses its significance, deciding which cognitive processes should receive it. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, a functional attention filter prevents you from noticing each one. Conversely, you might hear your name even in a noisy room. Processing occurs in multiple stages, with attention repeatedly influencing the outcomes.\n\nFor the brain to effectively process information, it must first store it. Memory types include sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded, with each sensory input being encoded differently. For instance, verbal input can be encoded by appearance (structurally), sound (phonemically), or meaning (semantically). Once stored, information must be preserved. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which holds information for about 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons temporarily. Long-term memory preservation is believed to involve the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models explaining how knowledge is organized in the brain, influenced by human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented as nodes, linked by their relatedness. In such a network, \"chair\" might connect to \"table,\" which in turn connects to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States was hit by a severe financial crisis. Unemployment surged, the housing market collapsed, and numerous major American corporations were devastated. This recession continues today, prompting us to ask: what caused this crisis, and how can we prevent it? In essence, the crisis stemmed from self-serving and shortsighted political decisions that forced banks and firms to issue risky sub-prime loans within an already fragile financial system. At the same time, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were urged to underwrite and repackage these mortgages into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit default swaps (CDS). When borrowers defaulted, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves and passed this turmoil onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold, impacting the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis trace back to 1999 during the Clinton administration, as the President sought reelection by bolstering his popularity. The Clinton administration loosened lending restrictions to achieve this, laying the groundwork for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. In a 1999 report by Steven Holmes of the New York Times, it was noted, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As discussed earlier, and as Holmes foresaw, misguided lending inevitably led to the economic collapse.\n\nSeveral factors combined to destabilize the economy, including the new and intricate structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were extensively used in the years leading up to the crisis, further entangling various economic sectors with the housing market. This caused U.S. households and financial markets to overextend themselves in the housing market, leaving them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nUltimately, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities suffered. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, roughly 30% of the USA's GDP. Consequently, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to transform into commercial banks subject to stringent regulation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That moment in your narrative where you let your creativity soar, impressing everyone with your captivating, even enchanting language. Or perhaps it's the moment when your audience nods off or clicks \"Back,\" cursing your name. Dr. Merlin has been known to yell at her screen when she encounters an overload of information, and not in a good way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy dear readers are already familiar with the fundamental writing principle, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself in lengthy texts where either nothing occurs, or too much does. Exposition is like the mischievous imp on your shoulder urging you to dump the backstory to reach the exciting parts (distinct from the imp on the other shoulder coaxing you to detail every aspect of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition involves informing the audience about events, usually in straightforward writing. In film, it occurs when a character unloads a heap of information onto another, much like in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In novels, it’s the author doing the narrating.\n\nLet's consider an example. As you read a story, you're informed that the heroine met her beloved at a certain time and place, that they had a grand wedding, and that her husband was murdered before her eyes. You wouldn't anticipate this entire sequence to span two pages, with both characters sharing only a couple of lines of dialogue each. You'd expect the author to delve into the husband's character, demonstrating through his words and actions how deeply he cares for his wife, and you'd also expect the heroine to reveal in various ways how his presence profoundly impacted her life (especially if the story later explicitly states this). A well-rounded introduction to the husband's character would engage you emotionally with his fate and offer insight into the heroine's character: what she admired in him, the depth of their connection, hints about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as seen through his eyes, and so forth. You would grieve his death alongside her, thus becoming more invested in the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you’d anticipate more substance beyond the basic outline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you must flesh out that outline. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, and continues*) It's sometimes tempting to breeze through certain details. Maybe you're presenting a new character and you know he was in the Air Force, currently a night manager at a gas station, has been married twice, no kids, enjoys weekend fishing, secretly dreams of owning the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one, which aired live, was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The main story was about a man named Shad Hostettler in Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. They didn't mention her name but showed his mugshot, describing him as looking very sinister. This story was given about two minutes, as it was still unfolding. They only mentioned that he had stabbed her multiple times and was arrested. I felt they spent an appropriate amount of time on this report.\n\nThe second story involved an early morning shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, but no arrests or suspects were reported. The SWAT Team was investigating. This segment seemed brief, which I think might be because the victim was a black man or it occurred in a predominantly black neighborhood. I've noticed for years that crimes involving minorities often receive less attention. If a white child or adult is involved in a crime, the media tends to give it more coverage; whereas, if it's a minority, it might barely get mentioned.\n\nThe next report was about a gunshot hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were provided about where they believed the incident occurred. It was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nAnother story covered the predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to stay in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. The segment was short, perhaps to entice viewers to keep watching.\n\nThey also reported on a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie, about six feet tall and weighing around 150 pounds. I thought they spent an unusual amount of time focusing on his race and skin color.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin from Texas, sentenced for conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, instead of saying he received a 25-year sentence, they said \"300 months,\" possibly to make it sound more severe. They mentioned he was Hispanic, which I didn't find relevant to the story.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a type of security intended to replicate the performance of an index, commodity, or collection of assets similar to an index fund, but with greater flexibility as it trades like a stock on an exchange. An ETF offers the diversification benefits of an index fund along with advantages of individual stock ownership, such as the ability to short sell, buy on margin, and make transactions involving as little as one share. Despite these appealing features, ETFs have much lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund. However, they do have drawbacks, such as requiring a commission for each trade, akin to a stock order. Another advantage of ETFs is the wide range of funds available. Despite these stated benefits, it is prudent for knowledgeable financial investors to assess whether the promised advantages, such as diversification, truly exist and to what extent. In this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it with its top 10 holdings to determine if the benefits of holding a single ETF are comparable to those of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, and whether better arrangements of these stocks could result in a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.  \nTo assess the ETF, including every holding would be cumbersome, so we will focus only on the top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. Below is a list of these top 10 holdings and their asset percentage.  \nTo estimate how well these ten stocks represent the entire ETF IHF, we can use their current percentage of assets, adjusted to 100%, to calculate each stock's contribution to a portfolio’s Beta and Return if the portfolio comprised only these ten stocks in the proportions set by the ETF's holdings. The Beta and return calculations are shown in the chart below.  \nThe chart indicates that a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings achieves a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. It also shows that the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the entire ETF. Based on the results so far, a portfolio consisting solely of the top 10 holdings might offer higher returns with a lower beta. However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios are not statistically different.  \nTo determine if these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is calculated and adjusted to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Referring to Figure 17, there was a significant decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project. This was somewhat discouraging, and the reasons for this are unclear. The arrival of winter on a New England campus likely led to fewer individuals commuting by bicycle or on foot, possibly contributing to the decline. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester, a busy time when people are focused on completing schoolwork and grading, which might have caused the commuter log to be overlooked. Moreover, December brings the start of the hectic holiday season and a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many do not need to visit the campus. Classes resume in late January for the spring semester, which might also explain the low number of logs for that month. However, this doesn't fully account for the low submissions in February. It’s plausible that projects like this have an initial surge of enthusiasm that naturally wanes over time. To counter this trend, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign to revitalize interest, which successfully increased log submissions. Thus, maintaining project momentum was challenging due to both a natural decline in engagement and the specific issues related to holiday and semester breaks in higher education. \n\nAnother challenge was the cultural preference for the freedom and flexibility of driving personal cars. It’s crucial to offer incentives for alternative commuting methods. We provided numerous prizes such as gift certificates to local eateries, coffee shops, massage services, independent bookstores, and some larger chain stores. It would have been interesting to see how offering larger prizes, like a bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car, might have impacted participation, potentially countering the dip in engagement. The nature of the prizes remained the same throughout the project. If the prize value had increased over time, it might have sustained engagement. Although the gift cards were sufficient at the start, announcing bigger prizes like bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January might have boosted participation and engagement instead of seeing a decline.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all fifteen trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films typically utilize creative editing to create illusions. My analysis mainly focused on articulating the poetics of most trick films and looking into the unique characteristics of a few later ones. Generally, trick films from the turn of the century are set in a fixed location, framed within a frontal proscenium, lack camera movement, use long or medium shots, and follow a strict one shot = one film principle. However, some films from the early twentieth century deviate from these norms by incorporating elements like multiple shots. A prominent feature shared by these trick films is their filming on an indoor set within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remains stationary, not moving to track subjects or objects. This static composition was prevalent in early cinema, drawing inspiration from theater and, specifically for trick films, from vaudeville and magic acts. One limitation of this stage-based approach is that characters in trick films usually only move sideways, not towards or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move horizontally. Even when they exit the frame, the camera does not follow them. The frontal proscenium style also results in shots being mostly long or, less commonly, medium, with no close-ups in any Edison catalog trick films. This mirrors the theater and vaudeville tradition, where audiences view the entire performance within the stage's frame. As seen in most early films, actors remain in the middle ground, avoiding movement towards the camera, hence no close-ups occur. Typically, early trick films adhere to the concept that one conceptual shot constitutes a film. This confines the duration of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. It also restricts their dramatic or narrative scope, with most focusing on brief vaudeville-style tricks like magic, disappearing acts, and transformations with minimal storyline. However, in trick films, one conceptual shot to the viewer does not equate to one physical shot. A single \"shot\" may consist of several pieces joined to create the illusion of appearance or disappearance. For example, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a closer examination reveals the transition point to the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head,\" even though the entire film appears as one continuous shot to the viewer.",
            "Ian Watt characterizes the traditional \"Gothic Novel\" as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" in his work, The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic style has been both criticized and celebrated, with some arguing it lacks depth, while others praise its ability to evoke the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the first \"Gothic Novel,\" melded \"ancient and modern\" romance concepts to pioneer the proto-Gothic genre, offering a novel literary approach. Walpole incorporates \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' natural mimicry within 'modern' novels, labeling his work \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre heavily draws from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. By the time The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" was applied to various peoples, styles, and eras, perceived as outdated or lacking sophistication compared to \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The blend of theatrical \"Gothic\" and the novel's new format, which allows readers insight into characters' psychology, is what sustains the Gothic's relevance, making it simultaneously obsolete and novel for readers separated by time from its original writing. A central gothic theme in Gothic novels is Chivalry. The medieval chivalric ideal, focused on training a noble knight, is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is crucial to Gothic writers as it represents the classic knight—brave, honorable, and capable—and reflects the perceived absence of these ideals in society, particularly noted by Walpole. By employing chivalric concepts, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized (foreshadowing the Gothic's evolution into Romanticism) to critique and potentially enhance the present. When Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto, he was amidst political turmoil and concerned for the future. Engulfed in politics and (arguably) unjust accusations, Walpole may have begun to believe, consciously or not, that the supposed morality and inherent \"goodness\" of people during the gothic era were lacking in contemporary society. This notion is evident in characters like Frederic. Before encountering Frederic, readers learn he possesses many chivalric qualities: \n\nFrederic is portrayed with numerous traditional chivalric images; as a prince who has endured, been deeply affected by tragedy, and presumed killed by infidels. The \"gallant and courteous Knight\" figure is exaggerated, introducing the Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves the series of procedures used to move goods from a customer's order through the stages of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution until they reach the customer. The concept of supply chain management was introduced by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982. He described it as the comprehensive process of planning, executing, and overseeing the supply chain to meet customer needs effectively and efficiently. There are six fundamental components of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these components to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nThe first stage in the supply chain process is production, which serves as the foundation of the entire operation. This stage determines the timing, purpose, location, and methods of production. Managers must understand customer preferences, often assessed through market analysis, to determine what products to produce and in what quantities. Once these decisions are made, managers select the production site that best balances volume and quality, ensuring customer demand and satisfaction are met. After choosing a production location, managers focus on scheduling tasks and maintaining equipment. The production phase is crucial, as meticulous planning is essential to avoid costly delays and inefficiencies. For instance, during my time at Wal-Mart and Target, both companies used detailed guides and processes for various business aspects, from employee uniforms to shipment handling, ensuring smooth operations and clear expectations.\n\nThe second key element is supply, which involves strategic decisions about the facility's core capabilities and potential outsourcing partnerships. A company might have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with unique equipment, staff, and specializations. Managers must determine which division is best suited for specific processes. They may also choose to outsource work to other companies to enhance speed, which involves delivering quality and flexibility while minimizing costs or maintaining low expense levels.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their intricate detail and concentration on the era's aristocracy. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, while considered Victorian, deviate from this norm. These novels incorporate mystery and a touch of the unusual, which is not typical for the time, enhancing character development by providing deeper insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels often explore mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the specifics and purposes differ in each case. In Oliver Twist, these unusual events often reveal insights into Oliver’s inner struggles, his pains, and his understanding of the reality around him. When Oliver’s shooting is revisited in chapter 28, he re-experiences it vividly as if in a dream, while he seeks help. The passage highlights Oliver's lack of control over the situation and the severity of his health, emphasized by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, dulling his senses so that he doesn’t notice the \"unseen hand\" carrying him away; he relives his despair, detached from the immediate shock of pain, as it is now a constant presence associated with fear rather than surprise. Oliver’s sense of powerlessness is reinforced, as he is unable to influence the outcome of events even when his life is in jeopardy. This suggests a growing defeat within Oliver, as if Fagin is succeeding in breaking him, leading him to accept his despair and affecting his ability to respond. Otherwise, it could be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of self-preservation.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years back, I worked in an after-school program tutoring elementary students. I aimed to assist them with any subject they found challenging, though my expertise was in English and reading. An instructor asked me to help a young boy named Adrian, who was in third or fourth grade and struggling significantly with reading. I noticed something unusual; he pronounced some letters perfectly and others not at all—it was quite odd. Adrian, who was of Latino descent, spoke flawless English, yet we faced difficulties until I met his mother. While supervising a few students who didn’t go on a field trip, Adrian's mother arrived. She spoke only Spanish, and with my limited Spanish, we managed to communicate. It then struck me that Adrian could read well; he just wasn't familiar with the English alphabet. I hope this realization was beneficial for him eventually.\n\nI share this story to highlight language barriers in schools, especially in California. It also illustrates that these issues aren’t always obvious. Even a child who speaks English fluently may find reading it a significant challenge. Most would agree this issue exists, so what can be done? In Adrian's case, targeted tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation, was the answer. However, for children who barely speak English, solutions are more complex. There isn’t a single answer. Combining approaches like dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes is key.\n\nFirst, the dual language system is beneficial not only for Spanish-speaking children but for all students. \"Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.\" There is a misconception that these programs are a waste and won’t benefit most children, but that’s incorrect. If these programs were standard rather than exceptional, all children would benefit. Implementing this doesn't mean all teachers need to be bilingual, which is impractical. However, having bilingual aides or tutors is a reasonable and viable solution.",
            "From childhood, most of us are told about something greater than ourselves, beyond our understanding. Some learn about it in Sunday school, others at Temple, or through personal introspection. Many accept the religions handed down by our parents, while some reject them, denying anything beyond our own egocentric world. We might embrace one belief system only to later adopt another. Regardless of the path, we seek to define ourselves through our unique spiritual perspectives, searching for guidance to lead us from darkness into light.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on our front porch, listening to the rain on the tin roof and smoking cigarettes. The rainwater flooded the plants by the porch. He gazed into the rain, a look that was part searching, part reminiscing. He had become thinner in recent months, his clothes hanging loosely, and his hair was sparser. He continued to stare into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone and scared, unable to express how much I would miss him, as discussing it would make it more real. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer, and joined him in watching the June twilight rain.\n\nMy father died in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. Chemo and radiation had not eased his suffering, only extended his life beyond doctors' expectations, though the worth of this prolonged suffering was unclear to me. I questioned what kind of God would allow this. Alone at night, I found myself without prayers, feeling that if God existed, he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI didn't want to witness his passing, so I didn't. I couldn't watch the life that created me come to an end. I wanted to remember my father for how he lived, not how he died. I knew him better than anyone, even his family, and knew he wouldn't want his only child to witness his death. I stayed curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and enthusiastic advocate of Republicanism. Although mainly an agriculturist, his profession, combined with his brief political career, shaped him into a man renowned for his commitment and forthrightness regarding personal freedom and governance. His strong support for an agrarian system formed the foundation of nearly all his governmental views. His efforts to uphold and promote what he deemed the most superior profession influenced his perspectives on sovereignty, constitutionality, and even the judiciary.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique chance to establish an ideal system, as there was no native tradition to impede the founders, allowing for the creation of self-government. He was a firm believer in the natural rights of individuals, seeing them as interconnected—if one right is denied, all rights are diminished, reducing their value. Therefore, these rights should remain beyond governmental reach. He argued that in the so-called \"state of nature,\" those with physical strength and cunning intelligence thrived, but civilization must not follow this path.\n\nTo build this ideal society, Taylor thought that a government should be designed to consider the inherent good and evil within people. He held strong views on dualistic morality, stating that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those protecting private property, enhancing agriculture, and discouraging capitalism. He believed a government based on good principles would function fairly, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by greed and self-interest. Taylor saw self-interest as humanity's primary motivation, but only considered it evil when it led to societies exploiting others. A good government was essential to control man's natural evil, requiring vigilance to prevent the incorporation of bad principles.\n\nLike many staunch Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He desired a very limited Federal government, with no more rights or powers than explicitly granted by the Constitution. He recognized that a large Federal government was costly and likely to become tyrannical. However, he thought a simple, literal interpretation was risky without considering the writers' intentions, which could easily lead to corruption. Moreover, he viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defines the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind blankly taking in the view before me. Unemotional and silent, I observed with a practiced awareness, analyzing the scene without connecting it to any abstract notions. Thoughts flitted in and out of my mind so swiftly that it felt as if I had no genuine thoughts of my own, only a fluid experience of what I was observing. \n\nFollowing advice from an artist, I once bought an instructional book titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had wanted to learn to draw since I was six, and this book covered everything from understanding a pencil to how the brain interprets lines. One technique it suggested was framing the picture you want to study, transforming a complex scene, like a bowl of fruit in a kitchen, into a simpler, more manageable image.\n\nAt that moment, looking at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't mentally apply the artist’s frame. Overwhelmed and awestruck, I could only stand and gaze. Picasso had his blue period, Monet adored greenery, and the Italian Renaissance masters used a spectrum of colors. If I were to consider my perspective artistic, what lay before me was the start of my piece, my Work in Brown.\n\nFingertips touched my chosen tool, muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand moved, shaping what could have been my most creative moment. Water swirled calmly, clear and pristine. Bits of matter broke away and vanished. My muscles tensed again, and with more urgency, my hand hit the toilet handle once more. The stubborn brown mass remained, stuck like a slug at the bottom of the toilet.\n\nHolding a mop lightly, feet apart, a green tie uncomfortably knotted around my neck, I frowned at the unpleasant heap of processed matter left as a message for those of us cleaning the Rite Aid bathrooms. After several more flushes and moments of introspection, I reached for the toilet paper, wrapping my hand until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing upright, then bending at the waist, my hand slowly descended into the bowl, like a mother reaching into the oven for a Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "Teenagers are losing their lives on the road. Several factors contribute to this alarming trend among the youngest drivers in America. According to the National Institutes of Health, one aspect of the issue is that the adolescent brain is not fully developed to handle the dangers of driving. Additionally, sheer inexperience is a core problem. This lack of experience leads not only to more fatal accidents but also to an increased likelihood of rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeen drivers also perform significantly worse when accompanied by peers, a common occurrence. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a link between the passenger's age and the frequency of traffic accidents.  \nIn an effort to improve teen driver safety, California and other states have implemented temporary provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and disallow minors as passengers.  \nHowever, provisional licenses are, in my view, only temporary solutions. The fundamental issue is that young drivers, as a demographic, cannot adequately manage the risks and responsibilities of driving, according to statistical evidence. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 is too young for a standard driver's license. USA Today notes that Zuckerman's research indicates a prevalent tendency for thrill-seeking among those under 19-20. Therefore, delaying driving until this inclination subsides seems reasonable. If young teens continue to receive driver's licenses, not only will fatal accidents persist, but the death toll could rise dramatically in the coming years. By 2010, the children of Baby Boomers will be eligible to drive, introducing millions of new teen drivers to the roads.  \nAddressing this issue through legislation would be relatively straightforward. Schools could maintain driver's education programs to start the learning process, but individuals under 18 would be prohibited from driving. A provisional permit could still precede a full license, with a requisite number of practical training hours. The required hours could match those mandated by most states (for example, California currently requires 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult). Since the troubling statistics for teen drivers span all states, implementing uniform national legislation would be a sensible—and, I believe, effective—way to safeguard teens nationwide.  \nThe proposed legislation is not a novel concept.",
            "This paper examines three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, it offers a concise definition of the disorder. It then discusses the diagnosis process, highlighting common traits or “red flags.” Finally, it concludes by suggesting ways a teacher in a mainstream classroom can support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), relates to how efficiently and effectively the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. Specifically, (C)AP refers to the CNS's perceptual processing of sounds and the neurobiological activity that underpins this process, leading to electrophysiologic auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, this disorder affects the brain's ability to properly process auditory input. Individuals with CAPD have normal hearing and are not classified as “hearing impaired”; the issue lies in the brain's ability to translate auditory information, such as distinguishing words or separating conversations from background noise.\n\nThe disorder, initially termed “auditory imperception,” was first mentioned in the mid-1950s when researchers assessed children with communication disorders (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). An Italian research group led by Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests in 1954. In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the physiology of the central auditory nervous system (CANS) in dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 spurred further research into CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways: individuals may struggle to localize or perceive sound in their environment; they might find it hard to distinguish between multiple “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); they may have trouble recognizing sound patterns or detecting changes in speech, such as identifying sarcasm through tonal shifts; one sound might obscure another; they may lack the ability to synthesize auditory clues into meaningful interpretations they can act on; and they might be unable to ascertain the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, patients must undergo “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,” which could be performed by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that assess auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This might involve questionnaires, surveys, and observations of auditory behavior, including responses to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single tool or test that consistently achieves a high diagnostic success rate, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Many tests involve presenting the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and requiring them to differentiate specific elements, such as a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests might include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to these signals.",
            "In my pursuit of a social work education, I aim to build a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on helping children who have faced abuse or neglect, and offering support to families in distress. The values I bring to social work include service, respect, ethical integrity, a commitment to enhancing relationships, and a dedication to professional growth to ensure competence. These values are essential not only to social workers but also hold personal significance for me.\n\nI've always had a desire to help others, though I was initially uncertain about the specific career path to take. During my high school and college years, I observed many people avoiding their problems in denial, with some resorting to ineffective coping strategies. These experiences led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Despite this, I was still unsure of a career direction and decided to take a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy on her couch. She explained that he was there to escape his abusive parents. The following day, I found out he had contacted the police at his parents' house. Wanting to help, I went to his parents' residence, where I shared my concerns with the police and mentioned my recent Psychology degree. The officers asked me to speak with the parents since the law offered no immediate solution for the teenager. When I confronted the parents, they appeared anxious and made excuses, labeling their son's actions as \"manipulative\" for seeking outside help for what they called \"simple\" disputes. This incident prompted me to seriously consider a career in social work to assist children facing such \"simple\" family conflicts.\n\nAnother crucial value for social work is social justice. As a society, we claim to value individuals, mourning those we lose. Yet, the societal notion of the \"individual\" often clings to outdated traditions rather than true uniqueness. If society grieves lost individuals, why do we strive to conform? I see myself as an individual and resist limiting myself to fit in. Throughout high school and college, I actively opposed social injustice by dyeing my hair in unconventional colors, expressing my personality through clothing, getting multiple ear piercings, joining the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and standing against racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. I am committed to social justice and will continue to challenge social injustice.",
            "This paper examines the Biological and Sociocultural models concerning the disorder of insomnia. The biological model emphasizes genetic inheritance and medical aspects of health, while the Sociocultural models consider environmental factors and their relevance to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia analyzes these models and details the research selected to enhance understanding of each model. The research findings are critiqued to highlight their particular strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder may be classified as a primary sleep disorder, a disorder related to another mental disorder, or a disorder caused by other factors. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, whereas sleep disorders linked to another mental disorder are associated with an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other sleep disorder categories can result from medical issues or substance use. Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty achieving or maintaining adequate sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia involves difficulty staying awake, both persisting for at least one month. Narcolepsy is characterized by cataplexy and/or automatic REM. Dyssomnias focus on starting and maintaining sleep, whereas Parasomnias relate to behavioral abnormalities and/or physiological occurrences during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep issues due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Intellectual Disability). This review primarily addresses insomnia and to some extent primary sleep disorders in general, in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders centers on genetic, heritable, and physiological aspects of sleep disorders. Neurons containing orexin in the hypothalamus regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study conducted on mice discovered that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are specifically responsible for sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor triggers responses that promote sleep. Inhibiting its firing can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) was found to increase sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that animal models using mice can be applicable to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. A deficiency or absence of this receptor might impair one's ability to achieve adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and any alteration of the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep for an individual, negatively affecting aspects of life such as education, career, and daily activities that involve repetitive tasks and concentration.",
            "I have attended University Park for about two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many, including myself. During my freshman year, I was housed in East Halls, located at the easternmost part of campus, aside from the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my room in Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard building, near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes, especially in the frequently poor weather of State College. An alum not much older than me mentioned that not long ago, East Halls were separated from the rest of the campus by large areas of unused land. Now, that space has been developed into sports fields, large new buildings like the new Creamery and health services building, and is surrounded by apartments. As our campus grows, moving from place to place becomes increasingly challenging. What is the best solution for improving mobility? On a college campus, it's the bicycle. However, simply having bikes isn't enough; students need to use them, and the campus should be designed to accommodate cyclists' needs.\n\nI spoke with a friend who recently started biking again after several years and wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are fantastic,” he said. “For a while, biking wasn’t considered cool, but it’s the only way to get around.” Besides being beneficial for your health, biking is the most efficient form of transportation. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical effort can take you over 30 miles. Like many undergraduates, I now live off-campus, as far from the campus center as some dorms. My smartest decision this year was buying a bike. I have a class in the Thomas building every day, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. If I cycle quickly, I can reduce that to 5 minutes. The main issue is that Pollock Road is the most direct route to the Thomas building from my house, but it's not always easy to navigate, whether you're biking or not. Walking has its benefits too, but I don’t have the time for it. Without my bike, walking would be my only dependable way to get to class. Walking to Thomas daily would cost me an extra 30-40 minutes, totaling over two and a half hours each week. Plus, the additional time needed to walk to other classes and appointments. That's more time than I can afford.",
            "In \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley critiques the impending dangers of technology and the capitalist framework that supports it through his depiction of a dystopian society. The inhabitants of this world prioritize community above the individual and are conditioned from birth to seek instant gratification above all else. The citizens are shown to be mere instruments in a larger scheme, restricted to a single ideology imposed by the World Controller. Through a Marxist lens, one can discern Huxley's skepticism about the advancement of these systems. Terms commonly associated with Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, emphasize that the novel serves as a critique of the flaws in the emerging economy of Huxley's era. Capitalism is mocked using the Marxist concept of false consciousness, wherein ordinary citizens are obscured from understanding their true economic relations with other classes, focusing instead on personal gain. This is attributed to the ideological control over the working class, evident in the people's conditioning in \"Brave New World.\" The lower classes, like Delta and Gamma, lack genuine autonomy; their compulsion to consume, spend, and indulge is intensified through hypnopaedia, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, the notion that entire social classes are dominated by another group, is clearly illustrated here. The lower classes remain oblivious to this manipulation, literally 'buying into an ideology that supports that structure' (i.e., capitalism and consumerism). Although the upper classes have the capacity to recognize this, few Alphas or Betas, except characters like Bernard, challenge their status. The interactions between social classes highlight the perceived oppression of capitalism. \n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" relationships between distinct individuals are nonexistent. The novel deliberately avoids giving depth to its characters, even major ones, suggesting perhaps that the combination of technological and capitalist growth strips humans of free will and self-expression. Love and intense emotions are absent; interactions remain shallow, exemplified by men's comments on women's physical attributes (e.g., pneumatic quality) and women's candid remarks on their liaisons. Additionally, each societal class's satisfaction with their place in the hierarchy reflects capitalism's socioeconomic impact. Their unwavering adherence to their role in the community mirrors Marxist views on the proletariat, who are falsely led to believe in their superiority, provided they continue to consume, comply, and conform with their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in an Islam course at CBC. A key point of contention in the class was whether Islam is inherently hostile. I feel this question is even more pertinent now. Reflecting on the time since 9/11, I've noticed a shift in the media's portrayal of Islam—from a hostile stance towards extremists to a more tolerant view of Islam in America. Back in 2001, it seemed unlikely that a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, who has a family background linked to Islam, could emerge.\n\nI find the Biography of the Prophet fascinating because, based on my understanding of Muhammad's history, it seems to contradict his character. Previously, I thought Muhammad compelled people to convert to Islam, conquering tribes and imposing the religion upon them. However, the biography depicts him as a martyr, misunderstood, yet humble, drawing people to his teachings who sought him out for the 'truth.'\n\nFurthermore, there are striking parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad. Notably, there is an account where Muhammad multiplies mutton and milk to feed forty men, reminiscent of biblical miracles. This portrayal suggests the writers intended to present Muhammad as a modest prophet, living in truth and miracles rather than proving himself. This type of narrative, in my view, undermines the miracles and life of Jesus Christ, seemingly appropriating Jesus' legacy through Muhammad.\n\nAdditionally, many stories in the biography aim to provide evidence of people's independent conversion to Islam, yet these accounts often originate from third-party sources. The narrative describes how someone heard from another person, creating a chain of hearsay. This approach was unconvincing to me, as it appeared to weaken the credibility of the stories, making them seem more dubious.\n\nWhat troubles me most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a divine man—humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. Yet, historical accounts challenge the notion of Muhammad as a gentle and humble figure. I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true historical context of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus during his lifetime were quickly set aside as Christian thought evolved after his death. Observing this history broadly, there's a noticeable trend of Christianity diverging from its origins. Presently, there is an increasing awareness and a progressive inclination. While some traditional individuals persist and resist thoughts beyond their learned teachings, they may not be influential enough to sway the majority. Among Christians, historical awareness is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. There will be a widespread desire to separate the doctrines added to Christianity over time from the original intent of its founder. This process might take decades or even centuries, but eventually, there will be a significant reversal in Christian history's trajectory, moving back to its original form. A growing movement will work to strip away layers of doctrine, akin to turning back the clock, until what remains is a representation of what Jesus initially brought to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers intervened. When this trend spreads across the United States and Europe, prompting people to worship as if living during Jesus' time, following only his teachings, the church as an institution will maintain its strength to guide this shift. However, with the theological clock turning backward, the current diversity within Christianity will give way to increased uniformity in beliefs and practices. Across regions, denominations, and divisions, we will witness growing similarities instead of differences. Human history is marked by significant reversions, such as the transformation of the Roman Empire from persecuting Christians to becoming a Christian institution, or the shift in our country from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The forthcoming great reversion will manifest within the Christian religion, reversing history in search of its source, and reducing diversity in the process. A key factor enabling this change will be interpreting Jesus’ words metaphorically rather than literally. So, what has occurred since Jesus' time? Looking back far enough, we find only Judaism, the theological foundation of Christianity. By the time the Romans conquered Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion. The Jewish population was not united, divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I think The Jungle illustrates that at their core, humans are inherently greedy and self-serving. Individuals tend to prioritize their own well-being and improvement, often neglecting those beneath them. This theme is evident throughout The Jungle, particularly in the behavior of the factory owners and managers. Their primary focus is on expanding and elevating their businesses, with little concern for the people or things negatively impacted by their progress. Upton Sinclair describes this vividly, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" highlighting the environmental destruction caused by pollution. Sinclair demonstrates the owners' disregard for anyone or anything harmed by their actions, including the massive smoke emissions and runoff from animal waste in Packingtown.  \n\nMoreover, these owners and managers were indifferent to the plight of their workers who contributed to their wealth. They were willing to employ any means to increase profits, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers endured grueling hours and could be dismissed en masse without notice or compensation. In the era depicted in The Jungle, worker protection laws and regulations were mostly nonexistent, enabling managers and owners to exploit their workers by demanding faster output and imposing harsh working conditions. Although the book does not overtly state it, those living and working in Packingtown were expected to endure these dire conditions both in the factories and their surrounding environment. There were no organizations to assist or inform the laborers. While unions did exist, they often exploited the poor workers financially instead of aiding them. The workers faced such severe mistreatment and systemic entrapment that they were likened to slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is regarded by Edgar Allan Poe as one of his finer poems. In this poem, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott links to Virgil. Virgil referred to an island north of Britain known to the Greeks as the edge of the known world. While Virgil indeed used the term, there is a more contemporary source that deserves recognition. Poe had a keen interest in German authors. This is significant because it demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's work. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" notes the resemblance between their poems, suggesting that Poe was influenced by Goethe. According to the Oxford Companion to English Literature, Goethe was renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Within Faust's second part is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" The poem narrates the story of a king who, after his wife dies and leaves him a goblet, begins drinking excessively and mourning her. Eventually, he decides to die, gives his possessions to his children except for the goblet, and throws it into the sea before dying. The nature of the King of Thule and the portrayal of the king in \"Dream-Land\" are strikingly similar, possibly reflecting a dark parallel to Poe’s own experiences with loss and drinking. \"Faust\" was also adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, shortly before Poe used the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe mentions Thule twice in his works, first as \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" and twice as bookends in \"Dream-Land.\" \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as complementary works. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes Thule's landscape as dark and lonely, haunted by the memories of deceased friends in a colorless world. These scenes resonate with \"The King of Thule,\" where the king, having lost his wife, is solitary and devoid of the will to rule or live. The poem reads as if the speaker steps into Goethe's narrative. Goethe was a prominent author, whom Poe would likely have known about, if not for his respect for Tennyson. Poe acknowledged this when asked about his admiration for Tennyson. Beyond the Tennyson connection, Poe would have encountered Goethe's work through the numerous reproductions following the original publication.",
            "Under California law, can a customer who was hurt after slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store receive punitive damages by demonstrating that the store manager acted with malice, given that he was informed twice about the spill but delayed cleaning it for half an hour because he was having dinner? A judge is unlikely to immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive damages. To justify such damages, a plaintiff must provide evidence that the defendant’s actions were carried out with willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm resulting from those actions, and also show that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have been aware of the potential harm of not cleaning up the spill, as several D&D customers had been injured from slipping incidents in the months before Palmer’s accident; despite this knowledge, he still neglected to address the spill. Palmer’s claim that Martin’s behavior was despicable might be less convincing, but remains reasonable given that six slip-and-fall accidents occurred in 2009, yet Martin still did not take the necessary steps to ensure store safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin replied that he was on a dinner break and \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin about the spill, and he gave the same response. At 5:30 pm on that day, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, suffering a severe back injury. Before Palmer's incident, five other slip-and-fall accidents had been reported at D&D in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damages claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud, or malice.” According to Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010), malice is defined as conduct intended to cause harm, or, without intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and carried out with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” Courts have deemed conduct malicious when done with a conscious disregard for the plaintiff’s rights, where the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "She always felt like something was missing in her life, a longing that never seemed satisfied. This feeling had started when she was about 14, just entering her teenage years, and persisted until she was 17. By then, she realized she was seeking someone rather than something. However, she didn't feel any attraction toward the boys around her. Though some boys had shown interest and awkwardly tried to win her over, none caught her attention. She often questioned herself about this unusual feeling, pondering what could cause such a peculiar situation for a teenage girl. Despite years of reflection, she came up with theories but nothing substantial enough to consider seriously. So, she continued living, constantly questioning her desires.\n\nAt home, the atmosphere was generally peaceful. Her parents were calm and rarely argued, even with her. The only disputes arose from her asserting her independence and free spirit. Despite being the daughter of a composed couple, she contrasted their calmness with her lively and engaging personality, which made her well-liked, especially since she was genuinely nice.\n\nHowever, today was different. As she wandered from room to room, searching for inspiration, she heard a short scream from the kitchen—the sound of her mother's lovely voice. Panic-stricken, she rushed in and anxiously asked, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the floor, in apparent pain, breathlessly repeating \"Ow.\" The daughter hurried to her side, trying to help. \"Ouch ... sweetie, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital,\" her mother said, her words strained. Realizing the severity of the situation, she agreed, asking where she could pick her up. Her mother gestured, and in that moment, the daughter was grateful for the strength she had built through her classes. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the backseat, and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital visit was filled with the scents of disinfectant and illness, underscored by fear. But she was too focused on aiding her mother to notice. She swiftly carried her inside, calling for medical help. Concerned faces gathered, and someone quickly brought a rolling bed to place her mother on. They took her away for immediate examination, leaving the daughter to sit and worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off a stepping stool while trying to retrieve a vase from their tallest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that closely following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet is a variation of the Med diet, marked by increased consumption of plant-based foods, such as plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (in preference to saturated fats), and fish, along with reduced intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is also part of the diet.\n\nEarlier prospective studies have shown a negative correlation between adherence to a Med diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. Additionally, an intervention trial revealed that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, previous studies did not specifically focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Between 1984 and 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) meant to evaluate nutrient intake over the preceding year. More than 95% of the nurses remained participants over the 20-year duration. The FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, cases were categorized as \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions falling into this category. For each FFQ, factors like body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated, and starting in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was evaluated.\n\nTo minimize random variation for individuals and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were computed (by averaging scores from the previous two years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could skew results) by controlling for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to assess the relationship between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for both fatal and nonfatal CHD and types of stroke.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a reduced risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over a 20-year follow-up, there were 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 new cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (including both fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "A sign reads, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Ellen Page, known for her role in *Juno*, stands alone at a street corner holding a cardboard sign with this disturbing message written in Sharpie. Burma, also called Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation controlled by a repressive military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, the country saw its first public demonstrations in a decade, led by a significant number of Burmese monks. These protests, named \"The Saffron Revolution\" after the color of the monks' robes, initially drew public attention. While the government initially tolerated these peaceful gatherings, violence soon escalated into what many viewed as a war between the monks and the military junta, which began attacking monasteries nationwide. Foreign journalists were detained on sight, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed on September 27, 2007, for covering a protest. Officially, 13 people were reported dead, but Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army shortly before the official report, claimed that the death toll was in the thousands.\n\nSuch events are not new. While these are some recent examples of global atrocities, the drive of governments to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over citizens has existed since the dawn of civilization. Early Roman emperors claimed divine selection for absolute rule over their societies. Japanese emperors were believed to be gods sent to guide their people toward prosperity, and the then-current U.S. president, George W. Bush, reportedly had regular conference calls with Ted Haggard, leading a group humorously termed \"Stupid People Worldwide,\" affiliated with the Republican Party.\n\nSome well-known historical instances of similar actions include the Tiananmen Square protests on June 4, 1989, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students protested the authoritarian government. The death toll is disputed, with Chinese government reports stating 200-300 dead, while the Chinese Red Cross estimated 2,000-3,000 fatalities. Another example is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias, supported by the Rwandan government, systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of their ethnicities. Hitler’s 'Third Reich' is another extreme case, during which people of Jewish descent were systematically rounded up and killed across multiple countries.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting impact on jazz is largely attributed to his long career and his exceptional ability to mold his orchestra creatively. While his piano presence is understated in many compositions chosen for this analysis, as a composer, Ellington was adept at crafting intricate and sophisticated pieces that highlighted the unique talents of his band members. He designed frameworks that allowed soloists to improvise freely, alongside tightly orchestrated sections that utilized the distinct styles of his musicians to bring musical ideas to the forefront. By doing so, he elevated the overall tone of the orchestra, producing cohesive and original sounds tailored for each composition. Ellington's skill in understanding the individual sounds of his players and how they synergized within the ensemble enabled him to compose some of jazz's most groundbreaking and impressive works.\n\nAccording to the Grove Music dictionary, Ellington's use of sound and innovation is exemplified in \"Creole Love Call,\" where he employed the voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This early work showcases his method of using voice to add texture and color without relying on lyrics. \"Creole Love Call\" also highlights Ellington's talent for complementing his soloists' styles, a consistent feature throughout his career. This deliberate twelve-bar blues piece includes six choruses, as detailed below:\n- Chorus 1: A call and response between voice and reeds, beginning with a smooth, melodic voice that shifts to a rougher tone.\n- Chorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the main melody, accentuating several extended blue notes.\n- Chorus 3: A high-register clarinet solo accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n- Chorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus through a call and response between the brass and reed sections.\n- Chorus 5: The piece's climactic section, where high-register reeds initiate the call and response, supported by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.\n- Chorus 6: Returns to the structure of the first chorus with call and response between voice and reeds, featuring the voice using a “growl” technique, acting as a solo instrument.\n- Tag: A brief conclusion with a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to introduce a new layer of tonal color in this piece is a hallmark of his style. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington combines his prowess in tight orchestration with his sensitivity to tone color. A call and response sequence between \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing blends the vocal qualities of Miley’s trumpet with the instrumental nature of Cox’s voice to produce a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" further develops these concepts, showcasing Ellington’s strategic use of Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a key member of Ellington's orchestra, who effectively introduces the melody on a muted trombone.",
            "What causes organisms to evolve in the specific ways they do? Are there limitations or constraints that guide evolutionary changes? In 1917, D’Arcy Thompson remarked that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" and this observation still holds true today. In recent years, mathematical modeling has been utilized to examine general aspects of mollusk shell formation across both individual development (ontogeny) and evolutionary history (phylogeny) (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of developmental and evolutionary changes in the Prunum genus, alongside experimental studies, can help clarify the mechanisms driving the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental change. We employed X-ray images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters, which were then used to model both theoretical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters were input into the software CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We created models of possible shell shapes to explore the limits of morphological change in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to enhance our understanding of macroevolutionary events within this group.\n\nA shell can be conceptualized as a cylindrical structure that rotates over time through 360 degrees of space. These rotations or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, spiraling around an imaginary central axis. This axis, which runs through the shell's central column, is known as the columella. The rate at which the whorls increase in size can differ, and a continuous line called a suture separates each whorl. Typically, the largest whorl is the final one, known as the body whorl. The spire consists of all the whorls except the last one. The apex is the tip of the spire, with the base at the opposite end. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The \"usual\" orientation is the apertural view, where the aperture faces the viewer and the apex points upward.)\n\nThe method for counting whorls is as follows. First, observe the shell from the apical view and identify the start of the first suture. Then, draw a line dividing the shell into two sections. Whorls are counted from this line and estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a sequence of apertures moving through time and space as the organism builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced using coordinates of each whorl's aperture center, along with the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented both graphically and mathematically. Once formulated mathematically, it becomes possible to adjust parameters and alter the mollusk's shell formation process.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have not shown significant change. Although the country is progressing toward several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, the pace of improvement in child and maternal health is insufficient to achieve the set targets by 2015. Various reasons for these deficiencies will be explored, highlighting a need to fortify the health system rather than focusing solely on specific programs. \n\nIndonesia has seen progress in the number of births attended by qualified health personnel, reaching 72%. However, this figure includes traditional practitioners like midwives who may not perform necessary medical procedures during complicated pregnancies, which contributes to high maternal mortality from hemorrhage. Thus, the perceived progress in this indicator may be misleading, and substantial work remains. Moreover, there's been a reduction in the percentage of children under five with diarrhea receiving professional medical treatment. Although data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is evidently an area of concern due to low nationwide rates.\n\nCesarean section rates remain low, around 4%, and reveal further issues. The rate is 7% in urban areas but only 2% in rural ones, indicating unequal healthcare access, which is mainly concentrated in urban centers. Another access issue involves vertical equity, with a 27% disparity in service use between the poorest and wealthiest groups, suggesting that the poor face greater challenges in accessing healthcare, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn contemplating the next steps to enhance neonatal and maternal healthcare metrics, the primary question is how to effectively address the service gaps. Should Indonesia adopt program-specific strategies or focus on strengthening the entire health system without concentrating solely on maternal and child care? Programmatic approaches are appealing as they offer targeted, manageable goals and generally yield quicker results. However, there are pitfalls to consider. A significant downside is that focusing resources on one health sector can detract from others, drawing human resources to the well-funded area (similar to how international funding for HIV/AIDS has impacted family planning). Moreover, running multiple overlapping programs for a single sector can lead to service duplication and lack of coordination, increasing administrative burdens for supplies and funding.",
            "Over the last century, the classification of popular music has expanded to such an extent that listing all its genres is nearly impossible. Adding to the complexity, nearly every genre—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—has developed numerous sub-genres and even sub-sub-genres. Among these, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock stands out as one of the most diverse and expressive within popular music over the past 40 years. It is considered expressive because it conveys a broad spectrum of emotions, often gravitating toward darker themes. Its diversity stems from the early realization of its flexibility, which encouraged people to create their own sub-genres, spawning further sub-sub-genres—a trend that continues today.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal scene is so fragmented into various niches that defining what heavy metal truly is has become challenging. It has absorbed numerous themes from other genres, yet, like all genres, it originated somewhere. To fully comprehend the metal music that pervades the contemporary scene, one must first grasp what the metal movement is and why it is regarded as a movement rather than merely a genre.\n\nIn many respects, metal is a movement characterized by darkness. It is often described as \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more theatricality. It features less primitivism and more technical skill, with musicians in metal bands demonstrating remarkable proficiency with their instruments, which is evident in their music. Unsurprisingly, metal is also a movement deeply influenced by drug use. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-70s led to increasingly wild and surreal music, with drugs often cited as catalysts for creativity. Metal possesses numerous dark, visceral elements, a novel feature in a music scene where much popular music did not typically explore the darker emotional spectrum. Furthermore, later generations of metal drew inspiration from the dark, visceral elements prominent during the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as those from \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles illustrate the darkness integral to the movement.\n\nThese lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" reveal the darker tendencies of the Beatles, reflecting a tumultuous experience, possibly influenced by drugs. This song is considered by some as one of the first Heavy Metal tracks. It was a counter to a Rolling Stones song that was also heavy and dark. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate that they could match the Stones' intensity, leading them to include the song on The White Album.",
            "Several decades prior to the emergence of Surrealist artists and their dreamlike creations, Henri Rousseau was meticulously constructing his own dreams, both metaphorically and literally. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only showcases a woman marveling at the wonders of a dreamland but also symbolizes Rousseau's personal aspirations and ambitions as a painter. From the outset of his career, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from his fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet he found himself grappling with an internal conflict in pursuing this goal. The Dream encapsulates Rousseau's ongoing struggle throughout his career: whether to adapt to or imitate certain artistic styles to gain acceptance in the critical art world he cherished, or to remain creatively independent and distinct, forging his own path.\n\nTo analyze The Dream from this perspective, one must first understand Rousseau's biography. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware merchant who \"enjoyed bourgeois prosperity\" (Shattuck 47). Lacking formal artistic training, he worked for the French municipal toll service, known as a gabelou, until age forty, although he was mistakenly called a douanier, or customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The loss of his first wife, Clémence, following the deaths of eight infants, left Rousseau with only one surviving child, his daughter Julia, and deep sorrow (Shattuck 49). Seeking solace, he turned to painting for comfort and a fresh start. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized peasants in art, Rousseau was fundamentally a folk painter with dreams and aspirations akin to the average person of his class.\n\nRousseau's yearning for acceptance in the art world is somewhat understandable given his circumstances: he was not only self-taught and began his career later in life, but he was also creating art during the same period as many other renowned modern artists. Despite years of work, Rousseau did not achieve significant recognition until around the time Matisse was becoming established as an artist. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes that although the two were technically competitors, they differed in both style and their motivations for painting: \"Matisse feared painting in a clichéd manner, while Rousseau aimed to create a piece so conventional that he would be accepted by the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "Numerous esteemed thinkers have suggested a close link between ethics and aesthetics, or truth and beauty. I am convinced there is a fundamental reason for this. As John Keats expresses in “Ode on a Grecian Urn,” “Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we learn in life comes through education or experience. However, as Keats hints, we seem to understand ethics and aesthetics inherently, without traditional instruction. Both fields strive to describe rather than dictate. Our exploration of morality and beauty usually seeks to explain why art or literature is beautiful or why an act is moral, rather than providing a rulebook for creating good art or moral behavior. Moreover, critiques of art or morals often fail to fully encapsulate what makes something good or beautiful. Discussing the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might involve terms like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't ultimately explain why it's good art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often say, “There's just something about it” before offering a more detailed critique. I believe art and morals cannot be completely distilled into descriptions of their attributes. As Flannery O'Connor states, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how thoroughly we describe a literary work's features, something transcendent remains. I believe ethics shares this quality. Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.” I propose that this “something,” this je ne sais quoi, is the most powerful aspect of art and morality, and this transcendental nature links ethics and aesthetics. I think morality and art are deeply connected because we experience them profoundly at a noumenal level, a term borrowed from Kant. They affect us in ways that can be felt but not fully articulated. This connection is even more pronounced in literature. As McKean states, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Modern-day Germany is recognized as a powerful and unified nation, showcasing a unique cultural blend that stretches from the alpine shadows in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This cultural essence is also evident from Cologne on the Rhine River, through central Germany, to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given this distinctive culture, it's no surprise that Germany as we know it today stems from various sources and tribes.\n\nThe ancestral land of the Germans is known as Germania, though the origin of its name is a topic of great debate among scholars and historians. Tacitus suggested that the name originated from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were previously referred to as Germans before crossing the Rhine and engaging with the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar was the first to use the term “Germanus” in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, where he subdued the Gauls and fought with Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine under dubious circumstances. He adopted this term from the Gauls to differentiate between those he had conquered (the Gauls) and those he had not. While the exact origin is unclear, some propose it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar noted: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others suggest the name comes from the spear, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), used in warfare, or possibly from the Old Irish word garim, meaning “to shout,” indicating that the Germans were loud or noisy. (Names of Germany)\n\nIn his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum,” the early Roman historian Tacitus documented the origins of the Germans, stating, “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd who would abandon Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, at least not at that time. They would extend their conquests into Germania for goods and occasionally launch land campaigns, but ultimately they returned to their expansive empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the middle of the first century, they resided on the fringes of the Roman Empire, trading goods from the land and offering their skills by serving in the Roman army ranks (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "The play Twelfth Night suggests that while disguises can effectively enable prolonged deception, eventually one must abandon this false identity to avoid losing their true self. A major issue with ending such deception is the potential for feeling isolated. Ultimately, a person must choose between preserving their own identity or maintaining relationships with others. Some people may react indifferently to being deceived, but others might not be so forgiving and may feel offended by the charade.\n\nThe theme of deception in gender role reversal is particularly complex, raising questions, notably why someone feels compelled to adopt a disguise of the opposite gender. For Viola, this disguise is a means of self-preservation: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Arriving in an unfamiliar land, Viola chooses to disguise herself as a man to protect against potential threats. While her plan succeeds, it also isolates her from the women around her, depriving her of vital support. Complicating matters, her disguise is so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, Viola must contend with unspoken romantic feelings between herself and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261).\n\nTo a contemporary audience, Twelfth Night might illustrate how deception can reveal hidden emotions, particularly for Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest these characters confront subconscious desires brought to light by Viola/Cesario’s appearance. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario because of the male guise, or does she secretly have feelings for women? It is more plausible that Shakespeare’s character Olivia satirizes people of his era who judge others solely on appearance. This is shown by how easily Olivia shifts her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, viewing Cesario/Viola as family rather than a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "Various observers have highlighted the brutality of German colonial rule, especially regarding the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa. However, describing an entire colonial empire with a single characteristic would be overly simplistic. The German colonial empire was diverse in its policies and governance, as well as in its geographical spread. Education across the colonies was equally varied. When the British took control of German East Africa (now Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a large number of educated and literate Africans. German educational endeavors in Kamerun and other colonies were also commended by writers of the time. \n\nIn contrast, the situation in South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) was markedly different. Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and actively participated in the education of the indigenous people, in South West Africa, education for the natives was largely entrusted to missionary societies with minimal government backing. However, the government did allocate significant resources for the education of Europeans in the colony, setting up state schools and offering more substantial support and oversight to missionary schools. These educational policies left lasting impacts on South West Africa even after German colonial rule ended. While other German colonies had notable numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" A variety of social, political, and economic factors contributed to the unique experience of South West Africa. This paper aims to delve deeper by identifying these factors and focusing on new research regarding the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is extensive literature specifically addressing education in the German colonial empire. Most of these sources are in German and were composed in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the era of German colonial rule. The primary aim of early works was to describe the characteristics of educational systems in these colonies. Later English-language writings broadened the discussion through comparative studies of education in various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work explicitly addressing this paper's topic is Cohen’s study on education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and examines the factors contributing to their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa accounts for many of the distinctive features of the colony’s educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonial holdings, South West Africa had a somewhat temperate climate, though much of the area is covered by arid desert. The European population in South West Africa mirrored these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 white people resided in South West Africa, while the next largest settler population, in East Africa, had only 5,336.",
            "The United States and Mexico exemplify a longstanding rivalry that persisted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, acquiring Texas and the American Southwest. Numerous other conflicts occurred between the two countries, gradually diminishing just before World War I. The discord began over significant issues, including religion, culture, tradition, and conflicting material interests (Schmitt 1974, pp. 30-31). \n\nThis situation is similar to many other nations with enduring rivalries with neighboring countries. Nations sharing borders often experience conflicting interests, leading to rival positions. The United States and Mexico's rivalry is akin to many other long-standing border disputes. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, both nations' geographic proximity to the United States has made them rivals, while other Latin American countries have generally maintained good relations with the U.S. \n\nReligious differences contributed to the discord between the two nations, a common historical issue. Sally Frahm (2001) remarks that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86). Much like the ideological and interest-based rivalry of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, the U.S.-Mexico conflict involved ideological struggles rooted in religious preferences rather than political structures. This distrust stemmed from the historical animosity between the English and Spanish, inherited from their colonial pasts, which hindered positive foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identify 17 disputes between the U.S. and Mexico during their 57-year rivalry, mostly involving territorial issues related to border raids and frontier problems. Bandit raids from American border towns remained a significant issue until both nations applied military force along their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97). Schmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry began to subside as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109), eventually ending when American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the late 19th century (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was unexpectedly and abruptly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. At the time, I was working as a nurse, a career I chose because of my deep-seated need for the safety and security I lacked in childhood. I often heard the mantra, \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick,\" as I grew up. Despite dreaming of being a scientist or journalist, or both, I chose nursing.\n\nThen, at 46, I found myself single, with little savings, and unable to work. Even now, I remain disabled, living for 15 years on Social Security Disability with nothing I can truly call my own. I manage, but each day is a struggle, challenging my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Although nothing in my life is guaranteed anymore, one truth remains: I couldn't have survived all these years without the support of my family and a few good friends, regardless of my strength. When genuine disaster strikes, you don't feel very strong.\n\nMy point is that life will always have emergencies, big or small. There are no guarantees, and some challenges are too great to face alone, no matter how prepared you are.\n\nI fully agree that in the U.S., we need to stop relying solely on big government; clearly, it's deteriorating. However, I'd prefer to see Americans learning to trust and support one another, rather than each of us building fallout shelters in our backyards.\n\nConservatives in the U.S. often speak of the \"rugged individualism\" that built our nation, but in reality, what sustained our ancestors during tough times was compassion, mutual respect, and resource-sharing. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't reach the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, plastic sheeting, and duct tape for the windows in case of a biological attack. I have several flashlights, various batteries, plenty of candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have land and resources for a small farm and can preserve your food, do it. It's a great idea, as is having a wood stove, as long as you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while doing all this, make sure to get to know your neighbors.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he forsook worldly attachments and achieved enlightenment, his teachings eventually giving rise to Buddhism. The most traditional branch of Buddhism is Theravada Buddhism. This religion, now about 2,500 years old, has evolved since Buddha's time. This evolution is evident in places like Sri Lanka, a Theravada Buddhist nation, where the annual water-cutting ceremony takes place. Both monks and laypeople partake in this event, which holds religious significance despite not being directly taught by Buddha. Such changes span from surface-level traditions to the core doctrines of the religion. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community, encompassing both monastic and lay perspectives, has had to adapt its principles due to various internal and external influences, both supportive and adverse.\n\nSeveral key terms will be used throughout this discussion. \"Internal\" refers to influences arising from members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of their monastic status, while \"external\" refers to influences from non-Buddhists. A \"hostile\" force is one that harms or intends to harm the Buddhist community, often stemming from negative views of Buddhism. A \"benign\" force neither harms nor helps the community directly, though it may inadvertently do either. These terms will become relevant repeatedly in the discussion.\n\nTo begin, it's essential to understand the foundational doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists find refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially made up of the Tripitaka, or the \"three baskets\" of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the rules of discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. The metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (the inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Understanding these ideas is crucial to ending Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which is continuous. Ending Sansara also means overcoming lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) upon enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka establishes rules for living. Laypeople are expected to follow five precepts: not to kill, lie, steal, engage in sexual misconduct, or consume intoxicating substances. Monks adhere to many additional rules. The most fundamental concept in Buddhism is the four noble truths: first, Dukkha, the reality that life involves suffering; second, that attachment leads to suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.

            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture has a crucial influence on negotiations. It can be defined both by what it is and what it is not, as well as its implications. Culture is diverse and cannot be pigeonholed into being a single, uniform entity. Generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are overly simplistic and broad. While understanding cultural stereotypes can be helpful, it is more beneficial for a negotiator to grasp how a specific culture relates to the negotiation context and how its attitudes might impact discussions. When encountering a different culture, people often relate it to their own, leading to inevitable comparisons.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset may involve exploring its history and recognizing its biases. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, it is essential to accept it as it is and work within its framework, particularly in negotiations, especially if one holds a weaker position. Similarly, when negotiating in a foreign setting, respecting local traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and advance the negotiation process.\n\nIt's important to remember that culture isn't limited to national or international distinctions. Companies within a country often develop their own corporate cultures. For example, some companies might emphasize long work hours, while others prefer a more relaxed schedule. Corporate culture manifests in employee dress codes, communication styles (e.g., direct vs. indirect), and hiring practices. Some companies promote philanthropy broadly, while others limit it to approved charities or events. The variety in American corporate culture from one company to another (and even within different regions or environments) showcases the diversity of thought within a societal culture. Other cultures might appear more uniform, but this similarity suggests a need for deeper exploration.\n\nUnderstanding values is crucial because they explain the reasons behind a culture's behavior. If a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superior to succeed. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that values aggressive bargaining may not rush to settle. Considering these generalities is important before negotiations begin. However, it is also beneficial for a negotiator to learn about their counterpart personally to enhance the negotiation's effectiveness.",
            "The phrase “The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God’” is first found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and serves as the starting point for St. Anselm’s argument about the existence of God. Thomas Aquinas, another thinker we will explore, seemingly shares this belief. Since both of their arguments support the same idea, and our task is to assess which is more compelling, we will, for the sake of conciseness, assume they are both correct in their belief in the existence of the Biblical God. Considering a different type of deity would prevent a fair comparison of their arguments, as their defense is centered on a specific concept of God. Nonetheless, I propose that although each presents valid points, neither offers a complete rationale for belief in God.\n\nTo clarify this, we will first look at St. Anselm’s basic argument. Anselm suggests gaining understanding through faith, looking inward to find evidence of God. He argues that since God exists in our understanding, we cannot truly conceive of His nonexistence. Though his explanation can be complex and difficult to follow, the essence is that proof of God is within our minds. Anselm implies that we need not search beyond our own soul to find truth about God; this being’s existence is affirmed by examining what we inherently know to be true within ourselves. External evidence is seemingly unnecessary. This idea of accepting something without undeniable empirical evidence is often called faith in Christian texts.\n\nThis notion contrasts with St. Thomas Aquinas’s view. Aquinas argues that God’s existence can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, without relying on faith. This idea would aid evangelism, a key aspect of Christianity, by allowing the conversion of new believers through logic alone, without needing them to accept unproven beliefs. St. Thomas presents five logical arguments for God’s existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each case, he essentially shows that God’s existence is a logical necessity. If you know a puzzle is missing one piece and assemble the rest, logic allows you to deduce the features and existence of the missing piece without seeing it.",
            "Authors often employ a variety of techniques to evoke specific emotions or attitudes toward significant themes in their work, with some methods proving more effective than others. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes several such techniques. He sometimes combines an unusual adjective with a noun to create a distinct atmosphere around a topic. Alternatively, he attributes meaning to symbols and uses them to achieve the same effect. One prominent technique involves the symbolic use of colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. Fitzgerald assigns particular meanings to these colors, notably white/gray and red/pink, and later uses these meanings to evoke feelings related to key objects in the narrative.\n\nThe meanings attached to white/gray suggest uniformity, with white representing elegance and higher social standing, while gray implies age and fading. Fitzgerald establishes these meanings early in the novel by frequently using both colors. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are consistently associated with \"white\" attire—Daisy and Jordan are \"in white\" (8); Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party; Tom dons a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle; and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). An exception occurs when Nick perceives Gatsby's party, noting that the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further reinforces these associations by applying these colors to mundane subjects: Nick travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names on Nick's timetable are \"gray names\" (61) from Gatsby’s parties, and Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" (28), representing uniformity. Ordinary people and places are described as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), the valley of ashes features \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23), an \"Italian child\" by the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established sufficient meaning for white/gray, he uses them to denote insignificance or uniformity in certain subjects. This color symbolism begins with Daisy. After a lapse in the prominent use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" prompting readers to view her more as a uniform fixture, a mere object of Gatsby’s desire (74). Fitzgerald continues to employ this technique to reinforce Daisy's portrayal as a uniform entity, as seen in references to the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18) and her appearance in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County is highly productive agriculturally, attributed to its mild, sunny climate. Commonly grown crops include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture in the San Diego area is significant, with many local groups having long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also sought after. Numerous organic farms offer tours showcasing their agricultural practices and provide opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. These operations enable landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitats, thus supporting recreational use and offering farm tours and other revenue-generating or educational initiatives.  \n\nBeyond filling a potentially profitable niche, organic farming often promotes greater biodiversity in plant and animal life due to the absence of chemicals in soil and water. However, organic farming can incur higher costs compared to conventional farming. It demands more labor and management to handle pests, weeds, and soil fertilization without chemicals, and losses may be greater than with traditional methods. Additionally, small organic farms lack the economies of scale found in larger operations. Practices that are not directly related to organic farming but that benefit wildlife, such as planting cover crops, rotating grazing, removing invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create specific habitats, can also lead to increased labor costs. Thus, there are multiple reasons why a landowner in this scenario might seek financial support or expertise to maximize both profit and habitat quality.  \n\nThe land chosen for this example is a 160-acre parcel near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It consists of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland near the Cleveland National Forest. It is located in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which is under review and currently considers over a hundred plant and animal species. Many of these species, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, are endangered, while others, like burrowing owls, are declining and may soon be listed.  \n\nThis area was historically inhabited by Native Americans for countless generations and was later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This particular piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many decades. To understand what options a small farmer might have for reducing costs and maintaining wildlife-friendly operations, I selected a property from a real estate website and researched available government programs. I also identified an organic farm in the same region as a model for what someone farming this land might aim to achieve.",
            "There exists a connection between brothers that is unbreakable and unchangeable. Within this connection are a myriad of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, among others. Brothers inherently understand each other more than anyone else with such a bond, seeing themselves in each other. It is in the most critical moments that the true essence of this bond is revealed, whether in a positive or negative light. When these emotions become apparent, they come with significant consequences. To grasp the emotions stemming from this brotherly link, one must confront the outcomes they bring. Looking a brother in the eye and seeing their own reflection allows one to see themselves as they truly are, not as others perceive them. Their true character is found in their actions and the repercussions of those actions. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme and the tumultuous emotions that accompany it. Set against a richly described backdrop, these boys embark on a doomed journey. The climax presents a clash between bitter disappointment and intense pride, with only one brother surviving. This theme is illustrated through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, their interactions, and the narrator's perspective, which conveys the protagonist's complex emotions and his view of the world, both heavily influencing his actions. The protagonist's actions can be attributed to one primary emotion: pride. From the first time he ventures out with his little brother, Doodle, to their final, fateful journey, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He had wished for a brother to share in activities like \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He wanted a companion for racing to Horsehead Landing or sitting atop the great pine behind the barn. Clearly, these dreams were unattainable due to Doodle's frail heart, which made survival uncertain and vigorous physical activities nearly impossible. This realization crushed the young protagonist's fantasies. He even admits to feeling anger towards the fragile child, recalling thoughts of smothering him with a pillow. What kind of child would consider such an act? Yet, his heart softened when the small child smiled at him, a simple gesture that filled the protagonist with hope, indicating his determination was not very strong. Deep down, he had an inherent love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex and imaginative system for processing information. As technology has evolved from simple to sophisticated, the metaphors describing the brain have evolved too. Initially likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, later a book, and now a computer, these metaphors serve as simplified representations. However, it's important to remember that these comparisons have limitations and can lead to misconceptions.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound, or light into electrochemical signals. The brain processes this sensory input through both bottom-up and top-down methods. For instance, when viewing a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing involves assembling basic details such as color, orientation, and borders—where there's a rapid color change—to determine you're seeing a box. Meanwhile, top-down processing uses these initial decisions to speed up recognizing the box, helping you realize it’s a black box rather than a hole in the background.\n\nOnce information is processed to some extent, an attention filter assesses its significance, deciding which cognitive processes should receive it. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, a functional attention filter prevents you from noticing each one. Conversely, you might hear your name even in a noisy room. Processing occurs in multiple stages, with attention repeatedly influencing the outcomes.\n\nFor the brain to effectively process information, it must first store it. Memory types include sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded, with each sensory input being encoded differently. For instance, verbal input can be encoded by appearance (structurally), sound (phonemically), or meaning (semantically). Once stored, information must be preserved. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which holds information for about 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons temporarily. Long-term memory preservation is believed to involve the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models explaining how knowledge is organized in the brain, influenced by human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented as nodes, linked by their relatedness. In such a network, \"chair\" might connect to \"table,\" which in turn connects to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States was hit by a severe financial crisis. Unemployment surged, the housing market collapsed, and numerous major American corporations were devastated. This recession continues today, prompting us to ask: what caused this crisis, and how can we prevent it? In essence, the crisis stemmed from self-serving and shortsighted political decisions that forced banks and firms to issue risky sub-prime loans within an already fragile financial system. At the same time, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were urged to underwrite and repackage these mortgages into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit default swaps (CDS). When borrowers defaulted, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves and passed this turmoil onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold, impacting the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis trace back to 1999 during the Clinton administration, as the President sought reelection by bolstering his popularity. The Clinton administration loosened lending restrictions to achieve this, laying the groundwork for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. In a 1999 report by Steven Holmes of the New York Times, it was noted, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As discussed earlier, and as Holmes foresaw, misguided lending inevitably led to the economic collapse.\n\nSeveral factors combined to destabilize the economy, including the new and intricate structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were extensively used in the years leading up to the crisis, further entangling various economic sectors with the housing market. This caused U.S. households and financial markets to overextend themselves in the housing market, leaving them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nUltimately, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities suffered. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, roughly 30% of the USA's GDP. Consequently, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to transform into commercial banks subject to stringent regulation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That moment in your narrative where you let your creativity soar, impressing everyone with your captivating, even enchanting language. Or perhaps it's the moment when your audience nods off or clicks \"Back,\" cursing your name. Dr. Merlin has been known to yell at her screen when she encounters an overload of information, and not in a good way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy dear readers are already familiar with the fundamental writing principle, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself in lengthy texts where either nothing occurs, or too much does. Exposition is like the mischievous imp on your shoulder urging you to dump the backstory to reach the exciting parts (distinct from the imp on the other shoulder coaxing you to detail every aspect of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition involves informing the audience about events, usually in straightforward writing. In film, it occurs when a character unloads a heap of information onto another, much like in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In novels, it’s the author doing the narrating.\n\nLet's consider an example. As you read a story, you're informed that the heroine met her beloved at a certain time and place, that they had a grand wedding, and that her husband was murdered before her eyes. You wouldn't anticipate this entire sequence to span two pages, with both characters sharing only a couple of lines of dialogue each. You'd expect the author to delve into the husband's character, demonstrating through his words and actions how deeply he cares for his wife, and you'd also expect the heroine to reveal in various ways how his presence profoundly impacted her life (especially if the story later explicitly states this). A well-rounded introduction to the husband's character would engage you emotionally with his fate and offer insight into the heroine's character: what she admired in him, the depth of their connection, hints about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as seen through his eyes, and so forth. You would grieve his death alongside her, thus becoming more invested in the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you’d anticipate more substance beyond the basic outline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you must flesh out that outline. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, and continues*) It's sometimes tempting to breeze through certain details. Maybe you're presenting a new character and you know he was in the Air Force, currently a night manager at a gas station, has been married twice, no kids, enjoys weekend fishing, secretly dreams of owning the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one, which aired live, was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The main story was about a man named Shad Hostettler in Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. They didn't mention her name but showed his mugshot, describing him as looking very sinister. This story was given about two minutes, as it was still unfolding. They only mentioned that he had stabbed her multiple times and was arrested. I felt they spent an appropriate amount of time on this report.\n\nThe second story involved an early morning shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, but no arrests or suspects were reported. The SWAT Team was investigating. This segment seemed brief, which I think might be because the victim was a black man or it occurred in a predominantly black neighborhood. I've noticed for years that crimes involving minorities often receive less attention. If a white child or adult is involved in a crime, the media tends to give it more coverage; whereas, if it's a minority, it might barely get mentioned.\n\nThe next report was about a gunshot hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were provided about where they believed the incident occurred. It was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nAnother story covered the predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to stay in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. The segment was short, perhaps to entice viewers to keep watching.\n\nThey also reported on a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie, about six feet tall and weighing around 150 pounds. I thought they spent an unusual amount of time focusing on his race and skin color.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin from Texas, sentenced for conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, instead of saying he received a 25-year sentence, they said \"300 months,\" possibly to make it sound more severe. They mentioned he was Hispanic, which I didn't find relevant to the story.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a type of security intended to replicate the performance of an index, commodity, or collection of assets similar to an index fund, but with greater flexibility as it trades like a stock on an exchange. An ETF offers the diversification benefits of an index fund along with advantages of individual stock ownership, such as the ability to short sell, buy on margin, and make transactions involving as little as one share. Despite these appealing features, ETFs have much lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund. However, they do have drawbacks, such as requiring a commission for each trade, akin to a stock order. Another advantage of ETFs is the wide range of funds available. Despite these stated benefits, it is prudent for knowledgeable financial investors to assess whether the promised advantages, such as diversification, truly exist and to what extent. In this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it with its top 10 holdings to determine if the benefits of holding a single ETF are comparable to those of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, and whether better arrangements of these stocks could result in a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.  \nTo assess the ETF, including every holding would be cumbersome, so we will focus only on the top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. Below is a list of these top 10 holdings and their asset percentage.  \nTo estimate how well these ten stocks represent the entire ETF IHF, we can use their current percentage of assets, adjusted to 100%, to calculate each stock's contribution to a portfolio’s Beta and Return if the portfolio comprised only these ten stocks in the proportions set by the ETF's holdings. The Beta and return calculations are shown in the chart below.  \nThe chart indicates that a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings achieves a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. It also shows that the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the entire ETF. Based on the results so far, a portfolio consisting solely of the top 10 holdings might offer higher returns with a lower beta. However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios are not statistically different.  \nTo determine if these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is calculated and adjusted to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Referring to Figure 17, there was a significant decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project. This was somewhat discouraging, and the reasons for this are unclear. The arrival of winter on a New England campus likely led to fewer individuals commuting by bicycle or on foot, possibly contributing to the decline. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester, a busy time when people are focused on completing schoolwork and grading, which might have caused the commuter log to be overlooked. Moreover, December brings the start of the hectic holiday season and a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many do not need to visit the campus. Classes resume in late January for the spring semester, which might also explain the low number of logs for that month. However, this doesn't fully account for the low submissions in February. It’s plausible that projects like this have an initial surge of enthusiasm that naturally wanes over time. To counter this trend, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign to revitalize interest, which successfully increased log submissions. Thus, maintaining project momentum was challenging due to both a natural decline in engagement and the specific issues related to holiday and semester breaks in higher education. \n\nAnother challenge was the cultural preference for the freedom and flexibility of driving personal cars. It’s crucial to offer incentives for alternative commuting methods. We provided numerous prizes such as gift certificates to local eateries, coffee shops, massage services, independent bookstores, and some larger chain stores. It would have been interesting to see how offering larger prizes, like a bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car, might have impacted participation, potentially countering the dip in engagement. The nature of the prizes remained the same throughout the project. If the prize value had increased over time, it might have sustained engagement. Although the gift cards were sufficient at the start, announcing bigger prizes like bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January might have boosted participation and engagement instead of seeing a decline.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all fifteen trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films typically utilize creative editing to create illusions. My analysis mainly focused on articulating the poetics of most trick films and looking into the unique characteristics of a few later ones. Generally, trick films from the turn of the century are set in a fixed location, framed within a frontal proscenium, lack camera movement, use long or medium shots, and follow a strict one shot = one film principle. However, some films from the early twentieth century deviate from these norms by incorporating elements like multiple shots. A prominent feature shared by these trick films is their filming on an indoor set within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remains stationary, not moving to track subjects or objects. This static composition was prevalent in early cinema, drawing inspiration from theater and, specifically for trick films, from vaudeville and magic acts. One limitation of this stage-based approach is that characters in trick films usually only move sideways, not towards or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move horizontally. Even when they exit the frame, the camera does not follow them. The frontal proscenium style also results in shots being mostly long or, less commonly, medium, with no close-ups in any Edison catalog trick films. This mirrors the theater and vaudeville tradition, where audiences view the entire performance within the stage's frame. As seen in most early films, actors remain in the middle ground, avoiding movement towards the camera, hence no close-ups occur. Typically, early trick films adhere to the concept that one conceptual shot constitutes a film. This confines the duration of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. It also restricts their dramatic or narrative scope, with most focusing on brief vaudeville-style tricks like magic, disappearing acts, and transformations with minimal storyline. However, in trick films, one conceptual shot to the viewer does not equate to one physical shot. A single \"shot\" may consist of several pieces joined to create the illusion of appearance or disappearance. For example, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a closer examination reveals the transition point to the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head,\" even though the entire film appears as one continuous shot to the viewer.",
            "Ian Watt characterizes the traditional \"Gothic Novel\" as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" in his work, The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic style has been both criticized and celebrated, with some arguing it lacks depth, while others praise its ability to evoke the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the first \"Gothic Novel,\" melded \"ancient and modern\" romance concepts to pioneer the proto-Gothic genre, offering a novel literary approach. Walpole incorporates \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' natural mimicry within 'modern' novels, labeling his work \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre heavily draws from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. By the time The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" was applied to various peoples, styles, and eras, perceived as outdated or lacking sophistication compared to \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The blend of theatrical \"Gothic\" and the novel's new format, which allows readers insight into characters' psychology, is what sustains the Gothic's relevance, making it simultaneously obsolete and novel for readers separated by time from its original writing. A central gothic theme in Gothic novels is Chivalry. The medieval chivalric ideal, focused on training a noble knight, is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is crucial to Gothic writers as it represents the classic knight—brave, honorable, and capable—and reflects the perceived absence of these ideals in society, particularly noted by Walpole. By employing chivalric concepts, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized (foreshadowing the Gothic's evolution into Romanticism) to critique and potentially enhance the present. When Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto, he was amidst political turmoil and concerned for the future. Engulfed in politics and (arguably) unjust accusations, Walpole may have begun to believe, consciously or not, that the supposed morality and inherent \"goodness\" of people during the gothic era were lacking in contemporary society. This notion is evident in characters like Frederic. Before encountering Frederic, readers learn he possesses many chivalric qualities: \n\nFrederic is portrayed with numerous traditional chivalric images; as a prince who has endured, been deeply affected by tragedy, and presumed killed by infidels. The \"gallant and courteous Knight\" figure is exaggerated, introducing the Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves the series of procedures used to move goods from a customer's order through the stages of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution until they reach the customer. The concept of supply chain management was introduced by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982. He described it as the comprehensive process of planning, executing, and overseeing the supply chain to meet customer needs effectively and efficiently. There are six fundamental components of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these components to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nThe first stage in the supply chain process is production, which serves as the foundation of the entire operation. This stage determines the timing, purpose, location, and methods of production. Managers must understand customer preferences, often assessed through market analysis, to determine what products to produce and in what quantities. Once these decisions are made, managers select the production site that best balances volume and quality, ensuring customer demand and satisfaction are met. After choosing a production location, managers focus on scheduling tasks and maintaining equipment. The production phase is crucial, as meticulous planning is essential to avoid costly delays and inefficiencies. For instance, during my time at Wal-Mart and Target, both companies used detailed guides and processes for various business aspects, from employee uniforms to shipment handling, ensuring smooth operations and clear expectations.\n\nThe second key element is supply, which involves strategic decisions about the facility's core capabilities and potential outsourcing partnerships. A company might have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with unique equipment, staff, and specializations. Managers must determine which division is best suited for specific processes. They may also choose to outsource work to other companies to enhance speed, which involves delivering quality and flexibility while minimizing costs or maintaining low expense levels.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their intricate detail and concentration on the era's aristocracy. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, while considered Victorian, deviate from this norm. These novels incorporate mystery and a touch of the unusual, which is not typical for the time, enhancing character development by providing deeper insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels often explore mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the specifics and purposes differ in each case. In Oliver Twist, these unusual events often reveal insights into Oliver’s inner struggles, his pains, and his understanding of the reality around him. When Oliver’s shooting is revisited in chapter 28, he re-experiences it vividly as if in a dream, while he seeks help. The passage highlights Oliver's lack of control over the situation and the severity of his health, emphasized by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, dulling his senses so that he doesn’t notice the \"unseen hand\" carrying him away; he relives his despair, detached from the immediate shock of pain, as it is now a constant presence associated with fear rather than surprise. Oliver’s sense of powerlessness is reinforced, as he is unable to influence the outcome of events even when his life is in jeopardy. This suggests a growing defeat within Oliver, as if Fagin is succeeding in breaking him, leading him to accept his despair and affecting his ability to respond. Otherwise, it could be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of self-preservation.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years back, I worked in an after-school program tutoring elementary students. I aimed to assist them with any subject they found challenging, though my expertise was in English and reading. An instructor asked me to help a young boy named Adrian, who was in third or fourth grade and struggling significantly with reading. I noticed something unusual; he pronounced some letters perfectly and others not at all—it was quite odd. Adrian, who was of Latino descent, spoke flawless English, yet we faced difficulties until I met his mother. While supervising a few students who didn’t go on a field trip, Adrian's mother arrived. She spoke only Spanish, and with my limited Spanish, we managed to communicate. It then struck me that Adrian could read well; he just wasn't familiar with the English alphabet. I hope this realization was beneficial for him eventually.\n\nI share this story to highlight language barriers in schools, especially in California. It also illustrates that these issues aren’t always obvious. Even a child who speaks English fluently may find reading it a significant challenge. Most would agree this issue exists, so what can be done? In Adrian's case, targeted tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation, was the answer. However, for children who barely speak English, solutions are more complex. There isn’t a single answer. Combining approaches like dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes is key.\n\nFirst, the dual language system is beneficial not only for Spanish-speaking children but for all students. \"Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.\" There is a misconception that these programs are a waste and won’t benefit most children, but that’s incorrect. If these programs were standard rather than exceptional, all children would benefit. Implementing this doesn't mean all teachers need to be bilingual, which is impractical. However, having bilingual aides or tutors is a reasonable and viable solution.",
            "From childhood, most of us are told about something greater than ourselves, beyond our understanding. Some learn about it in Sunday school, others at Temple, or through personal introspection. Many accept the religions handed down by our parents, while some reject them, denying anything beyond our own egocentric world. We might embrace one belief system only to later adopt another. Regardless of the path, we seek to define ourselves through our unique spiritual perspectives, searching for guidance to lead us from darkness into light.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on our front porch, listening to the rain on the tin roof and smoking cigarettes. The rainwater flooded the plants by the porch. He gazed into the rain, a look that was part searching, part reminiscing. He had become thinner in recent months, his clothes hanging loosely, and his hair was sparser. He continued to stare into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone and scared, unable to express how much I would miss him, as discussing it would make it more real. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer, and joined him in watching the June twilight rain.\n\nMy father died in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. Chemo and radiation had not eased his suffering, only extended his life beyond doctors' expectations, though the worth of this prolonged suffering was unclear to me. I questioned what kind of God would allow this. Alone at night, I found myself without prayers, feeling that if God existed, he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI didn't want to witness his passing, so I didn't. I couldn't watch the life that created me come to an end. I wanted to remember my father for how he lived, not how he died. I knew him better than anyone, even his family, and knew he wouldn't want his only child to witness his death. I stayed curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and enthusiastic advocate of Republicanism. Although mainly an agriculturist, his profession, combined with his brief political career, shaped him into a man renowned for his commitment and forthrightness regarding personal freedom and governance. His strong support for an agrarian system formed the foundation of nearly all his governmental views. His efforts to uphold and promote what he deemed the most superior profession influenced his perspectives on sovereignty, constitutionality, and even the judiciary.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique chance to establish an ideal system, as there was no native tradition to impede the founders, allowing for the creation of self-government. He was a firm believer in the natural rights of individuals, seeing them as interconnected—if one right is denied, all rights are diminished, reducing their value. Therefore, these rights should remain beyond governmental reach. He argued that in the so-called \"state of nature,\" those with physical strength and cunning intelligence thrived, but civilization must not follow this path.\n\nTo build this ideal society, Taylor thought that a government should be designed to consider the inherent good and evil within people. He held strong views on dualistic morality, stating that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those protecting private property, enhancing agriculture, and discouraging capitalism. He believed a government based on good principles would function fairly, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by greed and self-interest. Taylor saw self-interest as humanity's primary motivation, but only considered it evil when it led to societies exploiting others. A good government was essential to control man's natural evil, requiring vigilance to prevent the incorporation of bad principles.\n\nLike many staunch Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He desired a very limited Federal government, with no more rights or powers than explicitly granted by the Constitution. He recognized that a large Federal government was costly and likely to become tyrannical. However, he thought a simple, literal interpretation was risky without considering the writers' intentions, which could easily lead to corruption. Moreover, he viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defines the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind blankly taking in the view before me. Unemotional and silent, I observed with a practiced awareness, analyzing the scene without connecting it to any abstract notions. Thoughts flitted in and out of my mind so swiftly that it felt as if I had no genuine thoughts of my own, only a fluid experience of what I was observing. \n\nFollowing advice from an artist, I once bought an instructional book titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had wanted to learn to draw since I was six, and this book covered everything from understanding a pencil to how the brain interprets lines. One technique it suggested was framing the picture you want to study, transforming a complex scene, like a bowl of fruit in a kitchen, into a simpler, more manageable image.\n\nAt that moment, looking at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't mentally apply the artist’s frame. Overwhelmed and awestruck, I could only stand and gaze. Picasso had his blue period, Monet adored greenery, and the Italian Renaissance masters used a spectrum of colors. If I were to consider my perspective artistic, what lay before me was the start of my piece, my Work in Brown.\n\nFingertips touched my chosen tool, muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand moved, shaping what could have been my most creative moment. Water swirled calmly, clear and pristine. Bits of matter broke away and vanished. My muscles tensed again, and with more urgency, my hand hit the toilet handle once more. The stubborn brown mass remained, stuck like a slug at the bottom of the toilet.\n\nHolding a mop lightly, feet apart, a green tie uncomfortably knotted around my neck, I frowned at the unpleasant heap of processed matter left as a message for those of us cleaning the Rite Aid bathrooms. After several more flushes and moments of introspection, I reached for the toilet paper, wrapping my hand until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing upright, then bending at the waist, my hand slowly descended into the bowl, like a mother reaching into the oven for a Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "Teenagers are losing their lives on the road. Several factors contribute to this alarming trend among the youngest drivers in America. According to the National Institutes of Health, one aspect of the issue is that the adolescent brain is not fully developed to handle the dangers of driving. Additionally, sheer inexperience is a core problem. This lack of experience leads not only to more fatal accidents but also to an increased likelihood of rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeen drivers also perform significantly worse when accompanied by peers, a common occurrence. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a link between the passenger's age and the frequency of traffic accidents.  \nIn an effort to improve teen driver safety, California and other states have implemented temporary provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and disallow minors as passengers.  \nHowever, provisional licenses are, in my view, only temporary solutions. The fundamental issue is that young drivers, as a demographic, cannot adequately manage the risks and responsibilities of driving, according to statistical evidence. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 is too young for a standard driver's license. USA Today notes that Zuckerman's research indicates a prevalent tendency for thrill-seeking among those under 19-20. Therefore, delaying driving until this inclination subsides seems reasonable. If young teens continue to receive driver's licenses, not only will fatal accidents persist, but the death toll could rise dramatically in the coming years. By 2010, the children of Baby Boomers will be eligible to drive, introducing millions of new teen drivers to the roads.  \nAddressing this issue through legislation would be relatively straightforward. Schools could maintain driver's education programs to start the learning process, but individuals under 18 would be prohibited from driving. A provisional permit could still precede a full license, with a requisite number of practical training hours. The required hours could match those mandated by most states (for example, California currently requires 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult). Since the troubling statistics for teen drivers span all states, implementing uniform national legislation would be a sensible—and, I believe, effective—way to safeguard teens nationwide.  \nThe proposed legislation is not a novel concept.",
            "This paper examines three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, it offers a concise definition of the disorder. It then discusses the diagnosis process, highlighting common traits or “red flags.” Finally, it concludes by suggesting ways a teacher in a mainstream classroom can support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), relates to how efficiently and effectively the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. Specifically, (C)AP refers to the CNS's perceptual processing of sounds and the neurobiological activity that underpins this process, leading to electrophysiologic auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, this disorder affects the brain's ability to properly process auditory input. Individuals with CAPD have normal hearing and are not classified as “hearing impaired”; the issue lies in the brain's ability to translate auditory information, such as distinguishing words or separating conversations from background noise.\n\nThe disorder, initially termed “auditory imperception,” was first mentioned in the mid-1950s when researchers assessed children with communication disorders (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). An Italian research group led by Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests in 1954. In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the physiology of the central auditory nervous system (CANS) in dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 spurred further research into CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways: individuals may struggle to localize or perceive sound in their environment; they might find it hard to distinguish between multiple “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); they may have trouble recognizing sound patterns or detecting changes in speech, such as identifying sarcasm through tonal shifts; one sound might obscure another; they may lack the ability to synthesize auditory clues into meaningful interpretations they can act on; and they might be unable to ascertain the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, patients must undergo “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,” which could be performed by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that assess auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This might involve questionnaires, surveys, and observations of auditory behavior, including responses to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single tool or test that consistently achieves a high diagnostic success rate, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Many tests involve presenting the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and requiring them to differentiate specific elements, such as a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests might include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to these signals.",
            "In my pursuit of a social work education, I aim to build a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on helping children who have faced abuse or neglect, and offering support to families in distress. The values I bring to social work include service, respect, ethical integrity, a commitment to enhancing relationships, and a dedication to professional growth to ensure competence. These values are essential not only to social workers but also hold personal significance for me.\n\nI've always had a desire to help others, though I was initially uncertain about the specific career path to take. During my high school and college years, I observed many people avoiding their problems in denial, with some resorting to ineffective coping strategies. These experiences led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Despite this, I was still unsure of a career direction and decided to take a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy on her couch. She explained that he was there to escape his abusive parents. The following day, I found out he had contacted the police at his parents' house. Wanting to help, I went to his parents' residence, where I shared my concerns with the police and mentioned my recent Psychology degree. The officers asked me to speak with the parents since the law offered no immediate solution for the teenager. When I confronted the parents, they appeared anxious and made excuses, labeling their son's actions as \"manipulative\" for seeking outside help for what they called \"simple\" disputes. This incident prompted me to seriously consider a career in social work to assist children facing such \"simple\" family conflicts.\n\nAnother crucial value for social work is social justice. As a society, we claim to value individuals, mourning those we lose. Yet, the societal notion of the \"individual\" often clings to outdated traditions rather than true uniqueness. If society grieves lost individuals, why do we strive to conform? I see myself as an individual and resist limiting myself to fit in. Throughout high school and college, I actively opposed social injustice by dyeing my hair in unconventional colors, expressing my personality through clothing, getting multiple ear piercings, joining the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and standing against racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. I am committed to social justice and will continue to challenge social injustice.",
            "This paper examines the Biological and Sociocultural models concerning the disorder of insomnia. The biological model emphasizes genetic inheritance and medical aspects of health, while the Sociocultural models consider environmental factors and their relevance to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia analyzes these models and details the research selected to enhance understanding of each model. The research findings are critiqued to highlight their particular strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder may be classified as a primary sleep disorder, a disorder related to another mental disorder, or a disorder caused by other factors. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, whereas sleep disorders linked to another mental disorder are associated with an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other sleep disorder categories can result from medical issues or substance use. Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty achieving or maintaining adequate sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia involves difficulty staying awake, both persisting for at least one month. Narcolepsy is characterized by cataplexy and/or automatic REM. Dyssomnias focus on starting and maintaining sleep, whereas Parasomnias relate to behavioral abnormalities and/or physiological occurrences during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep issues due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Intellectual Disability). This review primarily addresses insomnia and to some extent primary sleep disorders in general, in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders centers on genetic, heritable, and physiological aspects of sleep disorders. Neurons containing orexin in the hypothalamus regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study conducted on mice discovered that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are specifically responsible for sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor triggers responses that promote sleep. Inhibiting its firing can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) was found to increase sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that animal models using mice can be applicable to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. A deficiency or absence of this receptor might impair one's ability to achieve adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and any alteration of the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep for an individual, negatively affecting aspects of life such as education, career, and daily activities that involve repetitive tasks and concentration.",
            "I have attended University Park for about two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many, including myself. During my freshman year, I was housed in East Halls, located at the easternmost part of campus, aside from the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my room in Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard building, near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes, especially in the frequently poor weather of State College. An alum not much older than me mentioned that not long ago, East Halls were separated from the rest of the campus by large areas of unused land. Now, that space has been developed into sports fields, large new buildings like the new Creamery and health services building, and is surrounded by apartments. As our campus grows, moving from place to place becomes increasingly challenging. What is the best solution for improving mobility? On a college campus, it's the bicycle. However, simply having bikes isn't enough; students need to use them, and the campus should be designed to accommodate cyclists' needs.\n\nI spoke with a friend who recently started biking again after several years and wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are fantastic,” he said. “For a while, biking wasn’t considered cool, but it’s the only way to get around.” Besides being beneficial for your health, biking is the most efficient form of transportation. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical effort can take you over 30 miles. Like many undergraduates, I now live off-campus, as far from the campus center as some dorms. My smartest decision this year was buying a bike. I have a class in the Thomas building every day, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. If I cycle quickly, I can reduce that to 5 minutes. The main issue is that Pollock Road is the most direct route to the Thomas building from my house, but it's not always easy to navigate, whether you're biking or not. Walking has its benefits too, but I don’t have the time for it. Without my bike, walking would be my only dependable way to get to class. Walking to Thomas daily would cost me an extra 30-40 minutes, totaling over two and a half hours each week. Plus, the additional time needed to walk to other classes and appointments. That's more time than I can afford.",
            "In \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley critiques the impending dangers of technology and the capitalist framework that supports it through his depiction of a dystopian society. The inhabitants of this world prioritize community above the individual and are conditioned from birth to seek instant gratification above all else. The citizens are shown to be mere instruments in a larger scheme, restricted to a single ideology imposed by the World Controller. Through a Marxist lens, one can discern Huxley's skepticism about the advancement of these systems. Terms commonly associated with Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, emphasize that the novel serves as a critique of the flaws in the emerging economy of Huxley's era. Capitalism is mocked using the Marxist concept of false consciousness, wherein ordinary citizens are obscured from understanding their true economic relations with other classes, focusing instead on personal gain. This is attributed to the ideological control over the working class, evident in the people's conditioning in \"Brave New World.\" The lower classes, like Delta and Gamma, lack genuine autonomy; their compulsion to consume, spend, and indulge is intensified through hypnopaedia, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, the notion that entire social classes are dominated by another group, is clearly illustrated here. The lower classes remain oblivious to this manipulation, literally 'buying into an ideology that supports that structure' (i.e., capitalism and consumerism). Although the upper classes have the capacity to recognize this, few Alphas or Betas, except characters like Bernard, challenge their status. The interactions between social classes highlight the perceived oppression of capitalism. \n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" relationships between distinct individuals are nonexistent. The novel deliberately avoids giving depth to its characters, even major ones, suggesting perhaps that the combination of technological and capitalist growth strips humans of free will and self-expression. Love and intense emotions are absent; interactions remain shallow, exemplified by men's comments on women's physical attributes (e.g., pneumatic quality) and women's candid remarks on their liaisons. Additionally, each societal class's satisfaction with their place in the hierarchy reflects capitalism's socioeconomic impact. Their unwavering adherence to their role in the community mirrors Marxist views on the proletariat, who are falsely led to believe in their superiority, provided they continue to consume, comply, and conform with their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in an Islam course at CBC. A key point of contention in the class was whether Islam is inherently hostile. I feel this question is even more pertinent now. Reflecting on the time since 9/11, I've noticed a shift in the media's portrayal of Islam—from a hostile stance towards extremists to a more tolerant view of Islam in America. Back in 2001, it seemed unlikely that a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, who has a family background linked to Islam, could emerge.\n\nI find the Biography of the Prophet fascinating because, based on my understanding of Muhammad's history, it seems to contradict his character. Previously, I thought Muhammad compelled people to convert to Islam, conquering tribes and imposing the religion upon them. However, the biography depicts him as a martyr, misunderstood, yet humble, drawing people to his teachings who sought him out for the 'truth.'\n\nFurthermore, there are striking parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad. Notably, there is an account where Muhammad multiplies mutton and milk to feed forty men, reminiscent of biblical miracles. This portrayal suggests the writers intended to present Muhammad as a modest prophet, living in truth and miracles rather than proving himself. This type of narrative, in my view, undermines the miracles and life of Jesus Christ, seemingly appropriating Jesus' legacy through Muhammad.\n\nAdditionally, many stories in the biography aim to provide evidence of people's independent conversion to Islam, yet these accounts often originate from third-party sources. The narrative describes how someone heard from another person, creating a chain of hearsay. This approach was unconvincing to me, as it appeared to weaken the credibility of the stories, making them seem more dubious.\n\nWhat troubles me most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a divine man—humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. Yet, historical accounts challenge the notion of Muhammad as a gentle and humble figure. I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true historical context of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus during his lifetime were quickly set aside as Christian thought evolved after his death. Observing this history broadly, there's a noticeable trend of Christianity diverging from its origins. Presently, there is an increasing awareness and a progressive inclination. While some traditional individuals persist and resist thoughts beyond their learned teachings, they may not be influential enough to sway the majority. Among Christians, historical awareness is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. There will be a widespread desire to separate the doctrines added to Christianity over time from the original intent of its founder. This process might take decades or even centuries, but eventually, there will be a significant reversal in Christian history's trajectory, moving back to its original form. A growing movement will work to strip away layers of doctrine, akin to turning back the clock, until what remains is a representation of what Jesus initially brought to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers intervened. When this trend spreads across the United States and Europe, prompting people to worship as if living during Jesus' time, following only his teachings, the church as an institution will maintain its strength to guide this shift. However, with the theological clock turning backward, the current diversity within Christianity will give way to increased uniformity in beliefs and practices. Across regions, denominations, and divisions, we will witness growing similarities instead of differences. Human history is marked by significant reversions, such as the transformation of the Roman Empire from persecuting Christians to becoming a Christian institution, or the shift in our country from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The forthcoming great reversion will manifest within the Christian religion, reversing history in search of its source, and reducing diversity in the process. A key factor enabling this change will be interpreting Jesus’ words metaphorically rather than literally. So, what has occurred since Jesus' time? Looking back far enough, we find only Judaism, the theological foundation of Christianity. By the time the Romans conquered Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion. The Jewish population was not united, divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I think The Jungle illustrates that at their core, humans are inherently greedy and self-serving. Individuals tend to prioritize their own well-being and improvement, often neglecting those beneath them. This theme is evident throughout The Jungle, particularly in the behavior of the factory owners and managers. Their primary focus is on expanding and elevating their businesses, with little concern for the people or things negatively impacted by their progress. Upton Sinclair describes this vividly, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" highlighting the environmental destruction caused by pollution. Sinclair demonstrates the owners' disregard for anyone or anything harmed by their actions, including the massive smoke emissions and runoff from animal waste in Packingtown.  \n\nMoreover, these owners and managers were indifferent to the plight of their workers who contributed to their wealth. They were willing to employ any means to increase profits, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers endured grueling hours and could be dismissed en masse without notice or compensation. In the era depicted in The Jungle, worker protection laws and regulations were mostly nonexistent, enabling managers and owners to exploit their workers by demanding faster output and imposing harsh working conditions. Although the book does not overtly state it, those living and working in Packingtown were expected to endure these dire conditions both in the factories and their surrounding environment. There were no organizations to assist or inform the laborers. While unions did exist, they often exploited the poor workers financially instead of aiding them. The workers faced such severe mistreatment and systemic entrapment that they were likened to slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is regarded by Edgar Allan Poe as one of his finer poems. In this poem, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott links to Virgil. Virgil referred to an island north of Britain known to the Greeks as the edge of the known world. While Virgil indeed used the term, there is a more contemporary source that deserves recognition. Poe had a keen interest in German authors. This is significant because it demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's work. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" notes the resemblance between their poems, suggesting that Poe was influenced by Goethe. According to the Oxford Companion to English Literature, Goethe was renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Within Faust's second part is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" The poem narrates the story of a king who, after his wife dies and leaves him a goblet, begins drinking excessively and mourning her. Eventually, he decides to die, gives his possessions to his children except for the goblet, and throws it into the sea before dying. The nature of the King of Thule and the portrayal of the king in \"Dream-Land\" are strikingly similar, possibly reflecting a dark parallel to Poe’s own experiences with loss and drinking. \"Faust\" was also adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, shortly before Poe used the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe mentions Thule twice in his works, first as \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" and twice as bookends in \"Dream-Land.\" \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as complementary works. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes Thule's landscape as dark and lonely, haunted by the memories of deceased friends in a colorless world. These scenes resonate with \"The King of Thule,\" where the king, having lost his wife, is solitary and devoid of the will to rule or live. The poem reads as if the speaker steps into Goethe's narrative. Goethe was a prominent author, whom Poe would likely have known about, if not for his respect for Tennyson. Poe acknowledged this when asked about his admiration for Tennyson. Beyond the Tennyson connection, Poe would have encountered Goethe's work through the numerous reproductions following the original publication.",
            "Under California law, can a customer who was hurt after slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store receive punitive damages by demonstrating that the store manager acted with malice, given that he was informed twice about the spill but delayed cleaning it for half an hour because he was having dinner? A judge is unlikely to immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive damages. To justify such damages, a plaintiff must provide evidence that the defendant’s actions were carried out with willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm resulting from those actions, and also show that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have been aware of the potential harm of not cleaning up the spill, as several D&D customers had been injured from slipping incidents in the months before Palmer’s accident; despite this knowledge, he still neglected to address the spill. Palmer’s claim that Martin’s behavior was despicable might be less convincing, but remains reasonable given that six slip-and-fall accidents occurred in 2009, yet Martin still did not take the necessary steps to ensure store safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin replied that he was on a dinner break and \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin about the spill, and he gave the same response. At 5:30 pm on that day, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, suffering a severe back injury. Before Palmer's incident, five other slip-and-fall accidents had been reported at D&D in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damages claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud, or malice.” According to Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010), malice is defined as conduct intended to cause harm, or, without intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and carried out with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” Courts have deemed conduct malicious when done with a conscious disregard for the plaintiff’s rights, where the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "She always felt like something was missing in her life, a longing that never seemed satisfied. This feeling had started when she was about 14, just entering her teenage years, and persisted until she was 17. By then, she realized she was seeking someone rather than something. However, she didn't feel any attraction toward the boys around her. Though some boys had shown interest and awkwardly tried to win her over, none caught her attention. She often questioned herself about this unusual feeling, pondering what could cause such a peculiar situation for a teenage girl. Despite years of reflection, she came up with theories but nothing substantial enough to consider seriously. So, she continued living, constantly questioning her desires.\n\nAt home, the atmosphere was generally peaceful. Her parents were calm and rarely argued, even with her. The only disputes arose from her asserting her independence and free spirit. Despite being the daughter of a composed couple, she contrasted their calmness with her lively and engaging personality, which made her well-liked, especially since she was genuinely nice.\n\nHowever, today was different. As she wandered from room to room, searching for inspiration, she heard a short scream from the kitchen—the sound of her mother's lovely voice. Panic-stricken, she rushed in and anxiously asked, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the floor, in apparent pain, breathlessly repeating \"Ow.\" The daughter hurried to her side, trying to help. \"Ouch ... sweetie, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital,\" her mother said, her words strained. Realizing the severity of the situation, she agreed, asking where she could pick her up. Her mother gestured, and in that moment, the daughter was grateful for the strength she had built through her classes. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the backseat, and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital visit was filled with the scents of disinfectant and illness, underscored by fear. But she was too focused on aiding her mother to notice. She swiftly carried her inside, calling for medical help. Concerned faces gathered, and someone quickly brought a rolling bed to place her mother on. They took her away for immediate examination, leaving the daughter to sit and worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off a stepping stool while trying to retrieve a vase from their tallest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that closely following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet is a variation of the Med diet, marked by increased consumption of plant-based foods, such as plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (in preference to saturated fats), and fish, along with reduced intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is also part of the diet.\n\nEarlier prospective studies have shown a negative correlation between adherence to a Med diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. Additionally, an intervention trial revealed that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, previous studies did not specifically focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Between 1984 and 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) meant to evaluate nutrient intake over the preceding year. More than 95% of the nurses remained participants over the 20-year duration. The FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, cases were categorized as \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions falling into this category. For each FFQ, factors like body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated, and starting in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was evaluated.\n\nTo minimize random variation for individuals and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were computed (by averaging scores from the previous two years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could skew results) by controlling for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to assess the relationship between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for both fatal and nonfatal CHD and types of stroke.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a reduced risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over a 20-year follow-up, there were 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 new cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (including both fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",

Burma, also called Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation controlled by a repressive military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, the country saw its first public demonstrations in a decade, led by a significant number of Burmese monks. These protests, named \"The Saffron Revolution\" after the color of the monks' robes, initially drew public attention. While the government initially tolerated these peaceful gatherings, violence soon escalated into what many viewed as a war between the monks and the military junta, which began attacking monasteries nationwide. Foreign journalists were detained on sight, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed on September 27, 2007, for covering a protest. Officially, 13 people were reported dead, but Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army shortly before the official report, claimed that the death toll was in the thousands.\n\nSuch events are not new. While these are some recent examples of global atrocities, the drive of governments to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over citizens has existed since the dawn of civilization. Early Roman emperors claimed divine selection for absolute rule over their societies. Japanese emperors were believed to be gods sent to guide their people toward prosperity, and the then-current U.S. president, George W. Bush, reportedly had regular conference calls with Ted Haggard, leading a group humorously termed \"Stupid People Worldwide,\" affiliated with the Republican Party.\n\nSome well-known historical instances of similar actions include the Tiananmen Square protests on June 4, 1989, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students protested the authoritarian government. The death toll is disputed, with Chinese government reports stating 200-300 dead, while the Chinese Red Cross estimated 2,000-3,000 fatalities. Another example is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias, supported by the Rwandan government, systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of their ethnicities. Hitler’s 'Third Reich' is another extreme case, during which people of Jewish descent were systematically rounded up and killed across multiple countries.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting impact on jazz is largely attributed to his long career and his exceptional ability to mold his orchestra creatively. While his piano presence is understated in many compositions chosen for this analysis, as a composer, Ellington was adept at crafting intricate and sophisticated pieces that highlighted the unique talents of his band members. He designed frameworks that allowed soloists to improvise freely, alongside tightly orchestrated sections that utilized the distinct styles of his musicians to bring musical ideas to the forefront. By doing so, he elevated the overall tone of the orchestra, producing cohesive and original sounds tailored for each composition. Ellington's skill in understanding the individual sounds of his players and how they synergized within the ensemble enabled him to compose some of jazz's most groundbreaking and impressive works.\n\nAccording to the Grove Music dictionary, Ellington's use of sound and innovation is exemplified in \"Creole Love Call,\" where he employed the voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This early work showcases his method of using voice to add texture and color without relying on lyrics. \"Creole Love Call\" also highlights Ellington's talent for complementing his soloists' styles, a consistent feature throughout his career. This deliberate twelve-bar blues piece includes six choruses, as detailed below:\n- Chorus 1: A call and response between voice and reeds, beginning with a smooth, melodic voice that shifts to a rougher tone.\n- Chorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the main melody, accentuating several extended blue notes.\n- Chorus 3: A high-register clarinet solo accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n- Chorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus through a call and response between the brass and reed sections.\n- Chorus 5: The piece's climactic section, where high-register reeds initiate the call and response, supported by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.\n- Chorus 6: Returns to the structure of the first chorus with call and response between voice and reeds, featuring the voice using a “growl” technique, acting as a solo instrument.\n- Tag: A brief conclusion with a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to introduce a new layer of tonal color in this piece is a hallmark of his style. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington combines his prowess in tight orchestration with his sensitivity to tone color. A call and response sequence between \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing blends the vocal qualities of Miley’s trumpet with the instrumental nature of Cox’s voice to produce a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" further develops these concepts, showcasing Ellington’s strategic use of Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a key member of Ellington's orchestra, who effectively introduces the melody on a muted trombone.",
            "What causes organisms to evolve in the specific ways they do? Are there limitations or constraints that guide evolutionary changes? In 1917, D’Arcy Thompson remarked that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" and this observation still holds true today. In recent years, mathematical modeling has been utilized to examine general aspects of mollusk shell formation across both individual development (ontogeny) and evolutionary history (phylogeny) (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of developmental and evolutionary changes in the Prunum genus, alongside experimental studies, can help clarify the mechanisms driving the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental change. We employed X-ray images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters, which were then used to model both theoretical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters were input into the software CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We created models of possible shell shapes to explore the limits of morphological change in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to enhance our understanding of macroevolutionary events within this group.\n\nA shell can be conceptualized as a cylindrical structure that rotates over time through 360 degrees of space. These rotations or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, spiraling around an imaginary central axis. This axis, which runs through the shell's central column, is known as the columella. The rate at which the whorls increase in size can differ, and a continuous line called a suture separates each whorl. Typically, the largest whorl is the final one, known as the body whorl. The spire consists of all the whorls except the last one. The apex is the tip of the spire, with the base at the opposite end. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The \"usual\" orientation is the apertural view, where the aperture faces the viewer and the apex points upward.)\n\nThe method for counting whorls is as follows. First, observe the shell from the apical view and identify the start of the first suture. Then, draw a line dividing the shell into two sections. Whorls are counted from this line and estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a sequence of apertures moving through time and space as the organism builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced using coordinates of each whorl's aperture center, along with the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented both graphically and mathematically. Once formulated mathematically, it becomes possible to adjust parameters and alter the mollusk's shell formation process.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have not shown significant change. Although the country is progressing toward several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, the pace of improvement in child and maternal health is insufficient to achieve the set targets by 2015. Various reasons for these deficiencies will be explored, highlighting a need to fortify the health system rather than focusing solely on specific programs. \n\nIndonesia has seen progress in the number of births attended by qualified health personnel, reaching 72%. However, this figure includes traditional practitioners like midwives who may not perform necessary medical procedures during complicated pregnancies, which contributes to high maternal mortality from hemorrhage. Thus, the perceived progress in this indicator may be misleading, and substantial work remains. Moreover, there's been a reduction in the percentage of children under five with diarrhea receiving professional medical treatment. Although data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is evidently an area of concern due to low nationwide rates.\n\nCesarean section rates remain low, around 4%, and reveal further issues. The rate is 7% in urban areas but only 2% in rural ones, indicating unequal healthcare access, which is mainly concentrated in urban centers. Another access issue involves vertical equity, with a 27% disparity in service use between the poorest and wealthiest groups, suggesting that the poor face greater challenges in accessing healthcare, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn contemplating the next steps to enhance neonatal and maternal healthcare metrics, the primary question is how to effectively address the service gaps. Should Indonesia adopt program-specific strategies or focus on strengthening the entire health system without concentrating solely on maternal and child care? Programmatic approaches are appealing as they offer targeted, manageable goals and generally yield quicker results. However, there are pitfalls to consider. A significant downside is that focusing resources on one health sector can detract from others, drawing human resources to the well-funded area (similar to how international funding for HIV/AIDS has impacted family planning). Moreover, running multiple overlapping programs for a single sector can lead to service duplication and lack of coordination, increasing administrative burdens for supplies and funding.",
            "Over the last century, the classification of popular music has expanded to such an extent that listing all its genres is nearly impossible. Adding to the complexity, nearly every genre—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—has developed numerous sub-genres and even sub-sub-genres. Among these, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock stands out as one of the most diverse and expressive within popular music over the past 40 years. It is considered expressive because it conveys a broad spectrum of emotions, often gravitating toward darker themes. Its diversity stems from the early realization of its flexibility, which encouraged people to create their own sub-genres, spawning further sub-sub-genres—a trend that continues today.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal scene is so fragmented into various niches that defining what heavy metal truly is has become challenging. It has absorbed numerous themes from other genres, yet, like all genres, it originated somewhere. To fully comprehend the metal music that pervades the contemporary scene, one must first grasp what the metal movement is and why it is regarded as a movement rather than merely a genre.\n\nIn many respects, metal is a movement characterized by darkness. It is often described as \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more theatricality. It features less primitivism and more technical skill, with musicians in metal bands demonstrating remarkable proficiency with their instruments, which is evident in their music. Unsurprisingly, metal is also a movement deeply influenced by drug use. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-70s led to increasingly wild and surreal music, with drugs often cited as catalysts for creativity. Metal possesses numerous dark, visceral elements, a novel feature in a music scene where much popular music did not typically explore the darker emotional spectrum. Furthermore, later generations of metal drew inspiration from the dark, visceral elements prominent during the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as those from \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles illustrate the darkness integral to the movement.\n\nThese lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" reveal the darker tendencies of the Beatles, reflecting a tumultuous experience, possibly influenced by drugs. This song is considered by some as one of the first Heavy Metal tracks. It was a counter to a Rolling Stones song that was also heavy and dark. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate that they could match the Stones' intensity, leading them to include the song on The White Album.",
            "Several decades prior to the emergence of Surrealist artists and their dreamlike creations, Henri Rousseau was meticulously constructing his own dreams, both metaphorically and literally. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only showcases a woman marveling at the wonders of a dreamland but also symbolizes Rousseau's personal aspirations and ambitions as a painter. From the outset of his career, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from his fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet he found himself grappling with an internal conflict in pursuing this goal. The Dream encapsulates Rousseau's ongoing struggle throughout his career: whether to adapt to or imitate certain artistic styles to gain acceptance in the critical art world he cherished, or to remain creatively independent and distinct, forging his own path.\n\nTo analyze The Dream from this perspective, one must first understand Rousseau's biography. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware merchant who \"enjoyed bourgeois prosperity\" (Shattuck 47). Lacking formal artistic training, he worked for the French municipal toll service, known as a gabelou, until age forty, although he was mistakenly called a douanier, or customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The loss of his first wife, Clémence, following the deaths of eight infants, left Rousseau with only one surviving child, his daughter Julia, and deep sorrow (Shattuck 49). Seeking solace, he turned to painting for comfort and a fresh start. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized peasants in art, Rousseau was fundamentally a folk painter with dreams and aspirations akin to the average person of his class.\n\nRousseau's yearning for acceptance in the art world is somewhat understandable given his circumstances: he was not only self-taught and began his career later in life, but he was also creating art during the same period as many other renowned modern artists. Despite years of work, Rousseau did not achieve significant recognition until around the time Matisse was becoming established as an artist. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes that although the two were technically competitors, they differed in both style and their motivations for painting: \"Matisse feared painting in a clichéd manner, while Rousseau aimed to create a piece so conventional that he would be accepted by the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "Numerous esteemed thinkers have suggested a close link between ethics and aesthetics, or truth and beauty. I am convinced there is a fundamental reason for this. As John Keats expresses in “Ode on a Grecian Urn,” “Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we learn in life comes through education or experience. However, as Keats hints, we seem to understand ethics and aesthetics inherently, without traditional instruction. Both fields strive to describe rather than dictate. Our exploration of morality and beauty usually seeks to explain why art or literature is beautiful or why an act is moral, rather than providing a rulebook for creating good art or moral behavior. Moreover, critiques of art or morals often fail to fully encapsulate what makes something good or beautiful. Discussing the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might involve terms like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't ultimately explain why it's good art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often say, “There's just something about it” before offering a more detailed critique. I believe art and morals cannot be completely distilled into descriptions of their attributes. As Flannery O'Connor states, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how thoroughly we describe a literary work's features, something transcendent remains. I believe ethics shares this quality. Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.” I propose that this “something,” this je ne sais quoi, is the most powerful aspect of art and morality, and this transcendental nature links ethics and aesthetics. I think morality and art are deeply connected because we experience them profoundly at a noumenal level, a term borrowed from Kant. They affect us in ways that can be felt but not fully articulated. This connection is even more pronounced in literature. As McKean states, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Modern-day Germany is recognized as a powerful and unified nation, showcasing a unique cultural blend that stretches from the alpine shadows in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This cultural essence is also evident from Cologne on the Rhine River, through central Germany, to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given this distinctive culture, it's no surprise that Germany as we know it today stems from various sources and tribes.\n\nThe ancestral land of the Germans is known as Germania, though the origin of its name is a topic of great debate among scholars and historians. Tacitus suggested that the name originated from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were previously referred to as Germans before crossing the Rhine and engaging with the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar was the first to use the term “Germanus” in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, where he subdued the Gauls and fought with Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine under dubious circumstances. He adopted this term from the Gauls to differentiate between those he had conquered (the Gauls) and those he had not. While the exact origin is unclear, some propose it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar noted: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others suggest the name comes from the spear, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), used in warfare, or possibly from the Old Irish word garim, meaning “to shout,” indicating that the Germans were loud or noisy. (Names of Germany)\n\nIn his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum,” the early Roman historian Tacitus documented the origins of the Germans, stating, “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd who would abandon Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, at least not at that time. They would extend their conquests into Germania for goods and occasionally launch land campaigns, but ultimately they returned to their expansive empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the middle of the first century, they resided on the fringes of the Roman Empire, trading goods from the land and offering their skills by serving in the Roman army ranks (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "The play Twelfth Night suggests that while disguises can effectively enable prolonged deception, eventually one must abandon this false identity to avoid losing their true self. A major issue with ending such deception is the potential for feeling isolated. Ultimately, a person must choose between preserving their own identity or maintaining relationships with others. Some people may react indifferently to being deceived, but others might not be so forgiving and may feel offended by the charade.\n\nThe theme of deception in gender role reversal is particularly complex, raising questions, notably why someone feels compelled to adopt a disguise of the opposite gender. For Viola, this disguise is a means of self-preservation: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Arriving in an unfamiliar land, Viola chooses to disguise herself as a man to protect against potential threats. While her plan succeeds, it also isolates her from the women around her, depriving her of vital support. Complicating matters, her disguise is so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, Viola must contend with unspoken romantic feelings between herself and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261).\n\nTo a contemporary audience, Twelfth Night might illustrate how deception can reveal hidden emotions, particularly for Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest these characters confront subconscious desires brought to light by Viola/Cesario’s appearance. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario because of the male guise, or does she secretly have feelings for women? It is more plausible that Shakespeare’s character Olivia satirizes people of his era who judge others solely on appearance. This is shown by how easily Olivia shifts her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, viewing Cesario/Viola as family rather than a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "Various observers have highlighted the brutality of German colonial rule, especially regarding the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa. However, describing an entire colonial empire with a single characteristic would be overly simplistic. The German colonial empire was diverse in its policies and governance, as well as in its geographical spread. Education across the colonies was equally varied. When the British took control of German East Africa (now Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a large number of educated and literate Africans. German educational endeavors in Kamerun and other colonies were also commended by writers of the time. \n\nIn contrast, the situation in South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) was markedly different. Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and actively participated in the education of the indigenous people, in South West Africa, education for the natives was largely entrusted to missionary societies with minimal government backing. However, the government did allocate significant resources for the education of Europeans in the colony, setting up state schools and offering more substantial support and oversight to missionary schools. These educational policies left lasting impacts on South West Africa even after German colonial rule ended. While other German colonies had notable numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" A variety of social, political, and economic factors contributed to the unique experience of South West Africa. This paper aims to delve deeper by identifying these factors and focusing on new research regarding the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is extensive literature specifically addressing education in the German colonial empire. Most of these sources are in German and were composed in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the era of German colonial rule. The primary aim of early works was to describe the characteristics of educational systems in these colonies. Later English-language writings broadened the discussion through comparative studies of education in various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work explicitly addressing this paper's topic is Cohen’s study on education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and examines the factors contributing to their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa accounts for many of the distinctive features of the colony’s educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonial holdings, South West Africa had a somewhat temperate climate, though much of the area is covered by arid desert. The European population in South West Africa mirrored these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 white people resided in South West Africa, while the next largest settler population, in East Africa, had only 5,336.",
            "The United States and Mexico exemplify a longstanding rivalry that persisted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, acquiring Texas and the American Southwest. Numerous other conflicts occurred between the two countries, gradually diminishing just before World War I. The discord began over significant issues, including religion, culture, tradition, and conflicting material interests (Schmitt 1974, pp. 30-31). \n\nThis situation is similar to many other nations with enduring rivalries with neighboring countries. Nations sharing borders often experience conflicting interests, leading to rival positions. The United States and Mexico's rivalry is akin to many other long-standing border disputes. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, both nations' geographic proximity to the United States has made them rivals, while other Latin American countries have generally maintained good relations with the U.S. \n\nReligious differences contributed to the discord between the two nations, a common historical issue. Sally Frahm (2001) remarks that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86). Much like the ideological and interest-based rivalry of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, the U.S.-Mexico conflict involved ideological struggles rooted in religious preferences rather than political structures. This distrust stemmed from the historical animosity between the English and Spanish, inherited from their colonial pasts, which hindered positive foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identify 17 disputes between the U.S. and Mexico during their 57-year rivalry, mostly involving territorial issues related to border raids and frontier problems. Bandit raids from American border towns remained a significant issue until both nations applied military force along their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97). Schmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry began to subside as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109), eventually ending when American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the late 19th century (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was unexpectedly and abruptly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. At the time, I was working as a nurse, a career I chose because of my deep-seated need for the safety and security I lacked in childhood. I often heard the mantra, \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick,\" as I grew up. Despite dreaming of being a scientist or journalist, or both, I chose nursing.\n\nThen, at 46, I found myself single, with little savings, and unable to work. Even now, I remain disabled, living for 15 years on Social Security Disability with nothing I can truly call my own. I manage, but each day is a struggle, challenging my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Although nothing in my life is guaranteed anymore, one truth remains: I couldn't have survived all these years without the support of my family and a few good friends, regardless of my strength. When genuine disaster strikes, you don't feel very strong.\n\nMy point is that life will always have emergencies, big or small. There are no guarantees, and some challenges are too great to face alone, no matter how prepared you are.\n\nI fully agree that in the U.S., we need to stop relying solely on big government; clearly, it's deteriorating. However, I'd prefer to see Americans learning to trust and support one another, rather than each of us building fallout shelters in our backyards.\n\nConservatives in the U.S. often speak of the \"rugged individualism\" that built our nation, but in reality, what sustained our ancestors during tough times was compassion, mutual respect, and resource-sharing. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't reach the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, plastic sheeting, and duct tape for the windows in case of a biological attack. I have several flashlights, various batteries, plenty of candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have land and resources for a small farm and can preserve your food, do it. It's a great idea, as is having a wood stove, as long as you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while doing all this, make sure to get to know your neighbors.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he forsook worldly attachments and achieved enlightenment, his teachings eventually giving rise to Buddhism. The most traditional branch of Buddhism is Theravada Buddhism. This religion, now about 2,500 years old, has evolved since Buddha's time. This evolution is evident in places like Sri Lanka, a Theravada Buddhist nation, where the annual water-cutting ceremony takes place. Both monks and laypeople partake in this event, which holds religious significance despite not being directly taught by Buddha. Such changes span from surface-level traditions to the core doctrines of the religion. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community, encompassing both monastic and lay perspectives, has had to adapt its principles due to various internal and external influences, both supportive and adverse.\n\nSeveral key terms will be used throughout this discussion. \"Internal\" refers to influences arising from members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of their monastic status, while \"external\" refers to influences from non-Buddhists. A \"hostile\" force is one that harms or intends to harm the Buddhist community, often stemming from negative views of Buddhism. A \"benign\" force neither harms nor helps the community directly, though it may inadvertently do either. These terms will become relevant repeatedly in the discussion.\n\nTo begin, it's essential to understand the foundational doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists find refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially made up of the Tripitaka, or the \"three baskets\" of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the rules of discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. The metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (the inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Understanding these ideas is crucial to ending Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which is continuous. Ending Sansara also means overcoming lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) upon enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka establishes rules for living. Laypeople are expected to follow five precepts: not to kill, lie, steal, engage in sexual misconduct, or consume intoxicating substances. Monks adhere to many additional rules. The most fundamental concept in Buddhism is the four noble truths: first, Dukkha, the reality that life involves suffering; second, that attachment leads to suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",

Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind.

Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day!

            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture has a crucial influence on negotiations. It can be defined both by what it is and what it is not, as well as its implications. Culture is diverse and cannot be pigeonholed into being a single, uniform entity. Generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are overly simplistic and broad. While understanding cultural stereotypes can be helpful, it is more beneficial for a negotiator to grasp how a specific culture relates to the negotiation context and how its attitudes might impact discussions. When encountering a different culture, people often relate it to their own, leading to inevitable comparisons.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset may involve exploring its history and recognizing its biases. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, it is essential to accept it as it is and work within its framework, particularly in negotiations, especially if one holds a weaker position. Similarly, when negotiating in a foreign setting, respecting local traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and advance the negotiation process.\n\nIt's important to remember that culture isn't limited to national or international distinctions. Companies within a country often develop their own corporate cultures. For example, some companies might emphasize long work hours, while others prefer a more relaxed schedule. Corporate culture manifests in employee dress codes, communication styles (e.g., direct vs. indirect), and hiring practices. Some companies promote philanthropy broadly, while others limit it to approved charities or events. The variety in American corporate culture from one company to another (and even within different regions or environments) showcases the diversity of thought within a societal culture. Other cultures might appear more uniform, but this similarity suggests a need for deeper exploration.\n\nUnderstanding values is crucial because they explain the reasons behind a culture's behavior. If a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superior to succeed. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that values aggressive bargaining may not rush to settle. Considering these generalities is important before negotiations begin. However, it is also beneficial for a negotiator to learn about their counterpart personally to enhance the negotiation's effectiveness.",
            "The phrase “The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God’” is first found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and serves as the starting point for St. Anselm’s argument about the existence of God. Thomas Aquinas, another thinker we will explore, seemingly shares this belief. Since both of their arguments support the same idea, and our task is to assess which is more compelling, we will, for the sake of conciseness, assume they are both correct in their belief in the existence of the Biblical God. Considering a different type of deity would prevent a fair comparison of their arguments, as their defense is centered on a specific concept of God. Nonetheless, I propose that although each presents valid points, neither offers a complete rationale for belief in God.\n\nTo clarify this, we will first look at St. Anselm’s basic argument. Anselm suggests gaining understanding through faith, looking inward to find evidence of God. He argues that since God exists in our understanding, we cannot truly conceive of His nonexistence. Though his explanation can be complex and difficult to follow, the essence is that proof of God is within our minds. Anselm implies that we need not search beyond our own soul to find truth about God; this being’s existence is affirmed by examining what we inherently know to be true within ourselves. External evidence is seemingly unnecessary. This idea of accepting something without undeniable empirical evidence is often called faith in Christian texts.\n\nThis notion contrasts with St. Thomas Aquinas’s view. Aquinas argues that God’s existence can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, without relying on faith. This idea would aid evangelism, a key aspect of Christianity, by allowing the conversion of new believers through logic alone, without needing them to accept unproven beliefs. St. Thomas presents five logical arguments for God’s existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each case, he essentially shows that God’s existence is a logical necessity. If you know a puzzle is missing one piece and assemble the rest, logic allows you to deduce the features and existence of the missing piece without seeing it.",
            "Authors often employ a variety of techniques to evoke specific emotions or attitudes toward significant themes in their work, with some methods proving more effective than others. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes several such techniques. He sometimes combines an unusual adjective with a noun to create a distinct atmosphere around a topic. Alternatively, he attributes meaning to symbols and uses them to achieve the same effect. One prominent technique involves the symbolic use of colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. Fitzgerald assigns particular meanings to these colors, notably white/gray and red/pink, and later uses these meanings to evoke feelings related to key objects in the narrative.\n\nThe meanings attached to white/gray suggest uniformity, with white representing elegance and higher social standing, while gray implies age and fading. Fitzgerald establishes these meanings early in the novel by frequently using both colors. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are consistently associated with \"white\" attire—Daisy and Jordan are \"in white\" (8); Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party; Tom dons a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle; and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). An exception occurs when Nick perceives Gatsby's party, noting that the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further reinforces these associations by applying these colors to mundane subjects: Nick travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names on Nick's timetable are \"gray names\" (61) from Gatsby’s parties, and Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" (28), representing uniformity. Ordinary people and places are described as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), the valley of ashes features \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23), an \"Italian child\" by the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established sufficient meaning for white/gray, he uses them to denote insignificance or uniformity in certain subjects. This color symbolism begins with Daisy. After a lapse in the prominent use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" prompting readers to view her more as a uniform fixture, a mere object of Gatsby’s desire (74). Fitzgerald continues to employ this technique to reinforce Daisy's portrayal as a uniform entity, as seen in references to the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18) and her appearance in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County is highly productive agriculturally, attributed to its mild, sunny climate. Commonly grown crops include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture in the San Diego area is significant, with many local groups having long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also sought after. Numerous organic farms offer tours showcasing their agricultural practices and provide opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. These operations enable landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitats, thus supporting recreational use and offering farm tours and other revenue-generating or educational initiatives.  \n\nBeyond filling a potentially profitable niche, organic farming often promotes greater biodiversity in plant and animal life due to the absence of chemicals in soil and water. However, organic farming can incur higher costs compared to conventional farming. It demands more labor and management to handle pests, weeds, and soil fertilization without chemicals, and losses may be greater than with traditional methods. Additionally, small organic farms lack the economies of scale found in larger operations. Practices that are not directly related to organic farming but that benefit wildlife, such as planting cover crops, rotating grazing, removing invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create specific habitats, can also lead to increased labor costs. Thus, there are multiple reasons why a landowner in this scenario might seek financial support or expertise to maximize both profit and habitat quality.  \n\nThe land chosen for this example is a 160-acre parcel near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It consists of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland near the Cleveland National Forest. It is located in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which is under review and currently considers over a hundred plant and animal species. Many of these species, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, are endangered, while others, like burrowing owls, are declining and may soon be listed.  \n\nThis area was historically inhabited by Native Americans for countless generations and was later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This particular piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many decades. To understand what options a small farmer might have for reducing costs and maintaining wildlife-friendly operations, I selected a property from a real estate website and researched available government programs. I also identified an organic farm in the same region as a model for what someone farming this land might aim to achieve.",
            "There exists a connection between brothers that is unbreakable and unchangeable. Within this connection are a myriad of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, among others. Brothers inherently understand each other more than anyone else with such a bond, seeing themselves in each other. It is in the most critical moments that the true essence of this bond is revealed, whether in a positive or negative light. When these emotions become apparent, they come with significant consequences. To grasp the emotions stemming from this brotherly link, one must confront the outcomes they bring. Looking a brother in the eye and seeing their own reflection allows one to see themselves as they truly are, not as others perceive them. Their true character is found in their actions and the repercussions of those actions. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme and the tumultuous emotions that accompany it. Set against a richly described backdrop, these boys embark on a doomed journey. The climax presents a clash between bitter disappointment and intense pride, with only one brother surviving. This theme is illustrated through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, their interactions, and the narrator's perspective, which conveys the protagonist's complex emotions and his view of the world, both heavily influencing his actions. The protagonist's actions can be attributed to one primary emotion: pride. From the first time he ventures out with his little brother, Doodle, to their final, fateful journey, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He had wished for a brother to share in activities like \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He wanted a companion for racing to Horsehead Landing or sitting atop the great pine behind the barn. Clearly, these dreams were unattainable due to Doodle's frail heart, which made survival uncertain and vigorous physical activities nearly impossible. This realization crushed the young protagonist's fantasies. He even admits to feeling anger towards the fragile child, recalling thoughts of smothering him with a pillow. What kind of child would consider such an act? Yet, his heart softened when the small child smiled at him, a simple gesture that filled the protagonist with hope, indicating his determination was not very strong. Deep down, he had an inherent love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex and imaginative system for processing information. As technology has evolved from simple to sophisticated, the metaphors describing the brain have evolved too. Initially likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, later a book, and now a computer, these metaphors serve as simplified representations. However, it's important to remember that these comparisons have limitations and can lead to misconceptions.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound, or light into electrochemical signals. The brain processes this sensory input through both bottom-up and top-down methods. For instance, when viewing a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing involves assembling basic details such as color, orientation, and borders—where there's a rapid color change—to determine you're seeing a box. Meanwhile, top-down processing uses these initial decisions to speed up recognizing the box, helping you realize it’s a black box rather than a hole in the background.\n\nOnce information is processed to some extent, an attention filter assesses its significance, deciding which cognitive processes should receive it. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, a functional attention filter prevents you from noticing each one. Conversely, you might hear your name even in a noisy room. Processing occurs in multiple stages, with attention repeatedly influencing the outcomes.\n\nFor the brain to effectively process information, it must first store it. Memory types include sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded, with each sensory input being encoded differently. For instance, verbal input can be encoded by appearance (structurally), sound (phonemically), or meaning (semantically). Once stored, information must be preserved. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which holds information for about 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons temporarily. Long-term memory preservation is believed to involve the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models explaining how knowledge is organized in the brain, influenced by human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented as nodes, linked by their relatedness. In such a network, \"chair\" might connect to \"table,\" which in turn connects to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States was hit by a severe financial crisis. Unemployment surged, the housing market collapsed, and numerous major American corporations were devastated. This recession continues today, prompting us to ask: what caused this crisis, and how can we prevent it? In essence, the crisis stemmed from self-serving and shortsighted political decisions that forced banks and firms to issue risky sub-prime loans within an already fragile financial system. At the same time, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were urged to underwrite and repackage these mortgages into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit default swaps (CDS). When borrowers defaulted, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves and passed this turmoil onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold, impacting the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis trace back to 1999 during the Clinton administration, as the President sought reelection by bolstering his popularity. The Clinton administration loosened lending restrictions to achieve this, laying the groundwork for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. In a 1999 report by Steven Holmes of the New York Times, it was noted, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As discussed earlier, and as Holmes foresaw, misguided lending inevitably led to the economic collapse.\n\nSeveral factors combined to destabilize the economy, including the new and intricate structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were extensively used in the years leading up to the crisis, further entangling various economic sectors with the housing market. This caused U.S. households and financial markets to overextend themselves in the housing market, leaving them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nUltimately, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities suffered. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, roughly 30% of the USA's GDP. Consequently, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to transform into commercial banks subject to stringent regulation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That moment in your narrative where you let your creativity soar, impressing everyone with your captivating, even enchanting language. Or perhaps it's the moment when your audience nods off or clicks \"Back,\" cursing your name. Dr. Merlin has been known to yell at her screen when she encounters an overload of information, and not in a good way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy dear readers are already familiar with the fundamental writing principle, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself in lengthy texts where either nothing occurs, or too much does. Exposition is like the mischievous imp on your shoulder urging you to dump the backstory to reach the exciting parts (distinct from the imp on the other shoulder coaxing you to detail every aspect of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition involves informing the audience about events, usually in straightforward writing. In film, it occurs when a character unloads a heap of information onto another, much like in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In novels, it’s the author doing the narrating.\n\nLet's consider an example. As you read a story, you're informed that the heroine met her beloved at a certain time and place, that they had a grand wedding, and that her husband was murdered before her eyes. You wouldn't anticipate this entire sequence to span two pages, with both characters sharing only a couple of lines of dialogue each. You'd expect the author to delve into the husband's character, demonstrating through his words and actions how deeply he cares for his wife, and you'd also expect the heroine to reveal in various ways how his presence profoundly impacted her life (especially if the story later explicitly states this). A well-rounded introduction to the husband's character would engage you emotionally with his fate and offer insight into the heroine's character: what she admired in him, the depth of their connection, hints about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as seen through his eyes, and so forth. You would grieve his death alongside her, thus becoming more invested in the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you’d anticipate more substance beyond the basic outline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you must flesh out that outline. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, and continues*) It's sometimes tempting to breeze through certain details. Maybe you're presenting a new character and you know he was in the Air Force, currently a night manager at a gas station, has been married twice, no kids, enjoys weekend fishing, secretly dreams of owning the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one, which aired live, was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The main story was about a man named Shad Hostettler in Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. They didn't mention her name but showed his mugshot, describing him as looking very sinister. This story was given about two minutes, as it was still unfolding. They only mentioned that he had stabbed her multiple times and was arrested. I felt they spent an appropriate amount of time on this report.\n\nThe second story involved an early morning shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, but no arrests or suspects were reported. The SWAT Team was investigating. This segment seemed brief, which I think might be because the victim was a black man or it occurred in a predominantly black neighborhood. I've noticed for years that crimes involving minorities often receive less attention. If a white child or adult is involved in a crime, the media tends to give it more coverage; whereas, if it's a minority, it might barely get mentioned.\n\nThe next report was about a gunshot hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were provided about where they believed the incident occurred. It was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nAnother story covered the predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to stay in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. The segment was short, perhaps to entice viewers to keep watching.\n\nThey also reported on a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie, about six feet tall and weighing around 150 pounds. I thought they spent an unusual amount of time focusing on his race and skin color.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin from Texas, sentenced for conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, instead of saying he received a 25-year sentence, they said \"300 months,\" possibly to make it sound more severe. They mentioned he was Hispanic, which I didn't find relevant to the story.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a type of security intended to replicate the performance of an index, commodity, or collection of assets similar to an index fund, but with greater flexibility as it trades like a stock on an exchange. An ETF offers the diversification benefits of an index fund along with advantages of individual stock ownership, such as the ability to short sell, buy on margin, and make transactions involving as little as one share. Despite these appealing features, ETFs have much lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund. However, they do have drawbacks, such as requiring a commission for each trade, akin to a stock order. Another advantage of ETFs is the wide range of funds available. Despite these stated benefits, it is prudent for knowledgeable financial investors to assess whether the promised advantages, such as diversification, truly exist and to what extent. In this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it with its top 10 holdings to determine if the benefits of holding a single ETF are comparable to those of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, and whether better arrangements of these stocks could result in a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.  \nTo assess the ETF, including every holding would be cumbersome, so we will focus only on the top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. Below is a list of these top 10 holdings and their asset percentage.  \nTo estimate how well these ten stocks represent the entire ETF IHF, we can use their current percentage of assets, adjusted to 100%, to calculate each stock's contribution to a portfolio’s Beta and Return if the portfolio comprised only these ten stocks in the proportions set by the ETF's holdings. The Beta and return calculations are shown in the chart below.  \nThe chart indicates that a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings achieves a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. It also shows that the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the entire ETF. Based on the results so far, a portfolio consisting solely of the top 10 holdings might offer higher returns with a lower beta. However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios are not statistically different.  \nTo determine if these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is calculated and adjusted to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Referring to Figure 17, there was a significant decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project. This was somewhat discouraging, and the reasons for this are unclear. The arrival of winter on a New England campus likely led to fewer individuals commuting by bicycle or on foot, possibly contributing to the decline. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester, a busy time when people are focused on completing schoolwork and grading, which might have caused the commuter log to be overlooked. Moreover, December brings the start of the hectic holiday season and a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many do not need to visit the campus. Classes resume in late January for the spring semester, which might also explain the low number of logs for that month. However, this doesn't fully account for the low submissions in February. It’s plausible that projects like this have an initial surge of enthusiasm that naturally wanes over time. To counter this trend, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign to revitalize interest, which successfully increased log submissions. Thus, maintaining project momentum was challenging due to both a natural decline in engagement and the specific issues related to holiday and semester breaks in higher education. \n\nAnother challenge was the cultural preference for the freedom and flexibility of driving personal cars. It’s crucial to offer incentives for alternative commuting methods. We provided numerous prizes such as gift certificates to local eateries, coffee shops, massage services, independent bookstores, and some larger chain stores. It would have been interesting to see how offering larger prizes, like a bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car, might have impacted participation, potentially countering the dip in engagement. The nature of the prizes remained the same throughout the project. If the prize value had increased over time, it might have sustained engagement. Although the gift cards were sufficient at the start, announcing bigger prizes like bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January might have boosted participation and engagement instead of seeing a decline.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all fifteen trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films typically utilize creative editing to create illusions. My analysis mainly focused on articulating the poetics of most trick films and looking into the unique characteristics of a few later ones. Generally, trick films from the turn of the century are set in a fixed location, framed within a frontal proscenium, lack camera movement, use long or medium shots, and follow a strict one shot = one film principle. However, some films from the early twentieth century deviate from these norms by incorporating elements like multiple shots. A prominent feature shared by these trick films is their filming on an indoor set within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remains stationary, not moving to track subjects or objects. This static composition was prevalent in early cinema, drawing inspiration from theater and, specifically for trick films, from vaudeville and magic acts. One limitation of this stage-based approach is that characters in trick films usually only move sideways, not towards or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move horizontally. Even when they exit the frame, the camera does not follow them. The frontal proscenium style also results in shots being mostly long or, less commonly, medium, with no close-ups in any Edison catalog trick films. This mirrors the theater and vaudeville tradition, where audiences view the entire performance within the stage's frame. As seen in most early films, actors remain in the middle ground, avoiding movement towards the camera, hence no close-ups occur. Typically, early trick films adhere to the concept that one conceptual shot constitutes a film. This confines the duration of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. It also restricts their dramatic or narrative scope, with most focusing on brief vaudeville-style tricks like magic, disappearing acts, and transformations with minimal storyline. However, in trick films, one conceptual shot to the viewer does not equate to one physical shot. A single \"shot\" may consist of several pieces joined to create the illusion of appearance or disappearance. For example, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a closer examination reveals the transition point to the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head,\" even though the entire film appears as one continuous shot to the viewer.",
            "Ian Watt characterizes the traditional \"Gothic Novel\" as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" in his work, The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic style has been both criticized and celebrated, with some arguing it lacks depth, while others praise its ability to evoke the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the first \"Gothic Novel,\" melded \"ancient and modern\" romance concepts to pioneer the proto-Gothic genre, offering a novel literary approach. Walpole incorporates \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' natural mimicry within 'modern' novels, labeling his work \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre heavily draws from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. By the time The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" was applied to various peoples, styles, and eras, perceived as outdated or lacking sophistication compared to \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The blend of theatrical \"Gothic\" and the novel's new format, which allows readers insight into characters' psychology, is what sustains the Gothic's relevance, making it simultaneously obsolete and novel for readers separated by time from its original writing. A central gothic theme in Gothic novels is Chivalry. The medieval chivalric ideal, focused on training a noble knight, is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is crucial to Gothic writers as it represents the classic knight—brave, honorable, and capable—and reflects the perceived absence of these ideals in society, particularly noted by Walpole. By employing chivalric concepts, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized (foreshadowing the Gothic's evolution into Romanticism) to critique and potentially enhance the present. When Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto, he was amidst political turmoil and concerned for the future. Engulfed in politics and (arguably) unjust accusations, Walpole may have begun to believe, consciously or not, that the supposed morality and inherent \"goodness\" of people during the gothic era were lacking in contemporary society. This notion is evident in characters like Frederic. Before encountering Frederic, readers learn he possesses many chivalric qualities: \n\nFrederic is portrayed with numerous traditional chivalric images; as a prince who has endured, been deeply affected by tragedy, and presumed killed by infidels. The \"gallant and courteous Knight\" figure is exaggerated, introducing the Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves the series of procedures used to move goods from a customer's order through the stages of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution until they reach the customer. The concept of supply chain management was introduced by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982. He described it as the comprehensive process of planning, executing, and overseeing the supply chain to meet customer needs effectively and efficiently. There are six fundamental components of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these components to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nThe first stage in the supply chain process is production, which serves as the foundation of the entire operation. This stage determines the timing, purpose, location, and methods of production. Managers must understand customer preferences, often assessed through market analysis, to determine what products to produce and in what quantities. Once these decisions are made, managers select the production site that best balances volume and quality, ensuring customer demand and satisfaction are met. After choosing a production location, managers focus on scheduling tasks and maintaining equipment. The production phase is crucial, as meticulous planning is essential to avoid costly delays and inefficiencies. For instance, during my time at Wal-Mart and Target, both companies used detailed guides and processes for various business aspects, from employee uniforms to shipment handling, ensuring smooth operations and clear expectations.\n\nThe second key element is supply, which involves strategic decisions about the facility's core capabilities and potential outsourcing partnerships. A company might have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with unique equipment, staff, and specializations. Managers must determine which division is best suited for specific processes. They may also choose to outsource work to other companies to enhance speed, which involves delivering quality and flexibility while minimizing costs or maintaining low expense levels.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their intricate detail and concentration on the era's aristocracy. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, while considered Victorian, deviate from this norm. These novels incorporate mystery and a touch of the unusual, which is not typical for the time, enhancing character development by providing deeper insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels often explore mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the specifics and purposes differ in each case. In Oliver Twist, these unusual events often reveal insights into Oliver’s inner struggles, his pains, and his understanding of the reality around him. When Oliver’s shooting is revisited in chapter 28, he re-experiences it vividly as if in a dream, while he seeks help. The passage highlights Oliver's lack of control over the situation and the severity of his health, emphasized by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, dulling his senses so that he doesn’t notice the \"unseen hand\" carrying him away; he relives his despair, detached from the immediate shock of pain, as it is now a constant presence associated with fear rather than surprise. Oliver’s sense of powerlessness is reinforced, as he is unable to influence the outcome of events even when his life is in jeopardy. This suggests a growing defeat within Oliver, as if Fagin is succeeding in breaking him, leading him to accept his despair and affecting his ability to respond. Otherwise, it could be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of self-preservation.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years back, I worked in an after-school program tutoring elementary students. I aimed to assist them with any subject they found challenging, though my expertise was in English and reading. An instructor asked me to help a young boy named Adrian, who was in third or fourth grade and struggling significantly with reading. I noticed something unusual; he pronounced some letters perfectly and others not at all—it was quite odd. Adrian, who was of Latino descent, spoke flawless English, yet we faced difficulties until I met his mother. While supervising a few students who didn’t go on a field trip, Adrian's mother arrived. She spoke only Spanish, and with my limited Spanish, we managed to communicate. It then struck me that Adrian could read well; he just wasn't familiar with the English alphabet. I hope this realization was beneficial for him eventually.\n\nI share this story to highlight language barriers in schools, especially in California. It also illustrates that these issues aren’t always obvious. Even a child who speaks English fluently may find reading it a significant challenge. Most would agree this issue exists, so what can be done? In Adrian's case, targeted tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation, was the answer. However, for children who barely speak English, solutions are more complex. There isn’t a single answer. Combining approaches like dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes is key.\n\nFirst, the dual language system is beneficial not only for Spanish-speaking children but for all students. \"Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.\" There is a misconception that these programs are a waste and won’t benefit most children, but that’s incorrect. If these programs were standard rather than exceptional, all children would benefit. Implementing this doesn't mean all teachers need to be bilingual, which is impractical. However, having bilingual aides or tutors is a reasonable and viable solution.",
            "From childhood, most of us are told about something greater than ourselves, beyond our understanding. Some learn about it in Sunday school, others at Temple, or through personal introspection. Many accept the religions handed down by our parents, while some reject them, denying anything beyond our own egocentric world. We might embrace one belief system only to later adopt another. Regardless of the path, we seek to define ourselves through our unique spiritual perspectives, searching for guidance to lead us from darkness into light.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on our front porch, listening to the rain on the tin roof and smoking cigarettes. The rainwater flooded the plants by the porch. He gazed into the rain, a look that was part searching, part reminiscing. He had become thinner in recent months, his clothes hanging loosely, and his hair was sparser. He continued to stare into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone and scared, unable to express how much I would miss him, as discussing it would make it more real. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer, and joined him in watching the June twilight rain.\n\nMy father died in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. Chemo and radiation had not eased his suffering, only extended his life beyond doctors' expectations, though the worth of this prolonged suffering was unclear to me. I questioned what kind of God would allow this. Alone at night, I found myself without prayers, feeling that if God existed, he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI didn't want to witness his passing, so I didn't. I couldn't watch the life that created me come to an end. I wanted to remember my father for how he lived, not how he died. I knew him better than anyone, even his family, and knew he wouldn't want his only child to witness his death. I stayed curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and enthusiastic advocate of Republicanism. Although mainly an agriculturist, his profession, combined with his brief political career, shaped him into a man renowned for his commitment and forthrightness regarding personal freedom and governance. His strong support for an agrarian system formed the foundation of nearly all his governmental views. His efforts to uphold and promote what he deemed the most superior profession influenced his perspectives on sovereignty, constitutionality, and even the judiciary.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique chance to establish an ideal system, as there was no native tradition to impede the founders, allowing for the creation of self-government. He was a firm believer in the natural rights of individuals, seeing them as interconnected—if one right is denied, all rights are diminished, reducing their value. Therefore, these rights should remain beyond governmental reach. He argued that in the so-called \"state of nature,\" those with physical strength and cunning intelligence thrived, but civilization must not follow this path.\n\nTo build this ideal society, Taylor thought that a government should be designed to consider the inherent good and evil within people. He held strong views on dualistic morality, stating that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those protecting private property, enhancing agriculture, and discouraging capitalism. He believed a government based on good principles would function fairly, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by greed and self-interest. Taylor saw self-interest as humanity's primary motivation, but only considered it evil when it led to societies exploiting others. A good government was essential to control man's natural evil, requiring vigilance to prevent the incorporation of bad principles.\n\nLike many staunch Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He desired a very limited Federal government, with no more rights or powers than explicitly granted by the Constitution. He recognized that a large Federal government was costly and likely to become tyrannical. However, he thought a simple, literal interpretation was risky without considering the writers' intentions, which could easily lead to corruption. Moreover, he viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defines the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind blankly taking in the view before me. Unemotional and silent, I observed with a practiced awareness, analyzing the scene without connecting it to any abstract notions. Thoughts flitted in and out of my mind so swiftly that it felt as if I had no genuine thoughts of my own, only a fluid experience of what I was observing. \n\nFollowing advice from an artist, I once bought an instructional book titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had wanted to learn to draw since I was six, and this book covered everything from understanding a pencil to how the brain interprets lines. One technique it suggested was framing the picture you want to study, transforming a complex scene, like a bowl of fruit in a kitchen, into a simpler, more manageable image.\n\nAt that moment, looking at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't mentally apply the artist’s frame. Overwhelmed and awestruck, I could only stand and gaze. Picasso had his blue period, Monet adored greenery, and the Italian Renaissance masters used a spectrum of colors. If I were to consider my perspective artistic, what lay before me was the start of my piece, my Work in Brown.\n\nFingertips touched my chosen tool, muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand moved, shaping what could have been my most creative moment. Water swirled calmly, clear and pristine. Bits of matter broke away and vanished. My muscles tensed again, and with more urgency, my hand hit the toilet handle once more. The stubborn brown mass remained, stuck like a slug at the bottom of the toilet.\n\nHolding a mop lightly, feet apart, a green tie uncomfortably knotted around my neck, I frowned at the unpleasant heap of processed matter left as a message for those of us cleaning the Rite Aid bathrooms.

Standing upright, then bending at the waist, my hand slowly descended into the bowl, like a mother reaching into the oven for a Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "Teenagers are losing their lives on the road. Several factors contribute to this alarming trend among the youngest drivers in America. According to the National Institutes of Health, one aspect of the issue is that the adolescent brain is not fully developed to handle the dangers of driving. Additionally, sheer inexperience is a core problem. This lack of experience leads not only to more fatal accidents but also to an increased likelihood of rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeen drivers also perform significantly worse when accompanied by peers, a common occurrence. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a link between the passenger's age and the frequency of traffic accidents.  \nIn an effort to improve teen driver safety, California and other states have implemented temporary provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and disallow minors as passengers.  \nHowever, provisional licenses are, in my view, only temporary solutions. The fundamental issue is that young drivers, as a demographic, cannot adequately manage the risks and responsibilities of driving, according to statistical evidence. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 is too young for a standard driver's license. USA Today notes that Zuckerman's research indicates a prevalent tendency for thrill-seeking among those under 19-20. Therefore, delaying driving until this inclination subsides seems reasonable. If young teens continue to receive driver's licenses, not only will fatal accidents persist, but the death toll could rise dramatically in the coming years. By 2010, the children of Baby Boomers will be eligible to drive, introducing millions of new teen drivers to the roads.  \nAddressing this issue through legislation would be relatively straightforward. Schools could maintain driver's education programs to start the learning process, but individuals under 18 would be prohibited from driving. A provisional permit could still precede a full license, with a requisite number of practical training hours. The required hours could match those mandated by most states (for example, California currently requires 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult). Since the troubling statistics for teen drivers span all states, implementing uniform national legislation would be a sensible—and, I believe, effective—way to safeguard teens nationwide.  \nThe proposed legislation is not a novel concept.",
            "This paper examines three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, it offers a concise definition of the disorder. It then discusses the diagnosis process, highlighting common traits or “red flags.” Finally, it concludes by suggesting ways a teacher in a mainstream classroom can support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), relates to how efficiently and effectively the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. Specifically, (C)AP refers to the CNS's perceptual processing of sounds and the neurobiological activity that underpins this process, leading to electrophysiologic auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, this disorder affects the brain's ability to properly process auditory input. Individuals with CAPD have normal hearing and are not classified as “hearing impaired”; the issue lies in the brain's ability to translate auditory information, such as distinguishing words or separating conversations from background noise.\n\nThe disorder, initially termed “auditory imperception,” was first mentioned in the mid-1950s when researchers assessed children with communication disorders (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). An Italian research group led by Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests in 1954. In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the physiology of the central auditory nervous system (CANS) in dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 spurred further research into CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways: individuals may struggle to localize or perceive sound in their environment; they might find it hard to distinguish between multiple “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); they may have trouble recognizing sound patterns or detecting changes in speech, such as identifying sarcasm through tonal shifts; one sound might obscure another; they may lack the ability to synthesize auditory clues into meaningful interpretations they can act on; and they might be unable to ascertain the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, patients must undergo “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,” which could be performed by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that assess auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This might involve questionnaires, surveys, and observations of auditory behavior, including responses to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single tool or test that consistently achieves a high diagnostic success rate, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Many tests involve presenting the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and requiring them to differentiate specific elements, such as a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests might include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to these signals.",
            "In my pursuit of a social work education, I aim to build a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on helping children who have faced abuse or neglect, and offering support to families in distress. The values I bring to social work include service, respect, ethical integrity, a commitment to enhancing relationships, and a dedication to professional growth to ensure competence. These values are essential not only to social workers but also hold personal significance for me.\n\nI've always had a desire to help others, though I was initially uncertain about the specific career path to take. During my high school and college years, I observed many people avoiding their problems in denial, with some resorting to ineffective coping strategies. These experiences led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Despite this, I was still unsure of a career direction and decided to take a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy on her couch. She explained that he was there to escape his abusive parents. The following day, I found out he had contacted the police at his parents' house. Wanting to help, I went to his parents' residence, where I shared my concerns with the police and mentioned my recent Psychology degree. The officers asked me to speak with the parents since the law offered no immediate solution for the teenager. When I confronted the parents, they appeared anxious and made excuses, labeling their son's actions as \"manipulative\" for seeking outside help for what they called \"simple\" disputes. This incident prompted me to seriously consider a career in social work to assist children facing such \"simple\" family conflicts.\n\nAnother crucial value for social work is social justice. As a society, we claim to value individuals, mourning those we lose. Yet, the societal notion of the \"individual\" often clings to outdated traditions rather than true uniqueness. If society grieves lost individuals, why do we strive to conform? I see myself as an individual and resist limiting myself to fit in. Throughout high school and college, I actively opposed social injustice by dyeing my hair in unconventional colors, expressing my personality through clothing, getting multiple ear piercings, joining the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and standing against racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. I am committed to social justice and will continue to challenge social injustice.",
            "This paper examines the Biological and Sociocultural models concerning the disorder of insomnia. The biological model emphasizes genetic inheritance and medical aspects of health, while the Sociocultural models consider environmental factors and their relevance to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia analyzes these models and details the research selected to enhance understanding of each model. The research findings are critiqued to highlight their particular strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder may be classified as a primary sleep disorder, a disorder related to another mental disorder, or a disorder caused by other factors. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, whereas sleep disorders linked to another mental disorder are associated with an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other sleep disorder categories can result from medical issues or substance use. Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty achieving or maintaining adequate sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia involves difficulty staying awake, both persisting for at least one month. Narcolepsy is characterized by cataplexy and/or automatic REM. Dyssomnias focus on starting and maintaining sleep, whereas Parasomnias relate to behavioral abnormalities and/or physiological occurrences during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep issues due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Intellectual Disability). This review primarily addresses insomnia and to some extent primary sleep disorders in general, in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders centers on genetic, heritable, and physiological aspects of sleep disorders. Neurons containing orexin in the hypothalamus regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study conducted on mice discovered that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are specifically responsible for sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor triggers responses that promote sleep. Inhibiting its firing can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) was found to increase sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that animal models using mice can be applicable to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. A deficiency or absence of this receptor might impair one's ability to achieve adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and any alteration of the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep for an individual, negatively affecting aspects of life such as education, career, and daily activities that involve repetitive tasks and concentration.",
            "I have attended University Park for about two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many, including myself. During my freshman year, I was housed in East Halls, located at the easternmost part of campus, aside from the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my room in Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard building, near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes, especially in the frequently poor weather of State College. An alum not much older than me mentioned that not long ago, East Halls were separated from the rest of the campus by large areas of unused land. Now, that space has been developed into sports fields, large new buildings like the new Creamery and health services building, and is surrounded by apartments. As our campus grows, moving from place to place becomes increasingly challenging. What is the best solution for improving mobility? On a college campus, it's the bicycle. However, simply having bikes isn't enough; students need to use them, and the campus should be designed to accommodate cyclists' needs.\n\nI spoke with a friend who recently started biking again after several years and wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are fantastic,” he said. “For a while, biking wasn’t considered cool, but it’s the only way to get around.” Besides being beneficial for your health, biking is the most efficient form of transportation. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical effort can take you over 30 miles. Like many undergraduates, I now live off-campus, as far from the campus center as some dorms. My smartest decision this year was buying a bike. I have a class in the Thomas building every day, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. If I cycle quickly, I can reduce that to 5 minutes. The main issue is that Pollock Road is the most direct route to the Thomas building from my house, but it's not always easy to navigate, whether you're biking or not. Walking has its benefits too, but I don’t have the time for it. Without my bike, walking would be my only dependable way to get to class. Walking to Thomas daily would cost me an extra 30-40 minutes, totaling over two and a half hours each week. Plus, the additional time needed to walk to other classes and appointments. That's more time than I can afford.",
            "In \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley critiques the impending dangers of technology and the capitalist framework that supports it through his depiction of a dystopian society. The inhabitants of this world prioritize community above the individual and are conditioned from birth to seek instant gratification above all else. The citizens are shown to be mere instruments in a larger scheme, restricted to a single ideology imposed by the World Controller. Through a Marxist lens, one can discern Huxley's skepticism about the advancement of these systems. Terms commonly associated with Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, emphasize that the novel serves as a critique of the flaws in the emerging economy of Huxley's era. Capitalism is mocked using the Marxist concept of false consciousness, wherein ordinary citizens are obscured from understanding their true economic relations with other classes, focusing instead on personal gain. This is attributed to the ideological control over the working class, evident in the people's conditioning in \"Brave New World.\" The lower classes, like Delta and Gamma, lack genuine autonomy; their compulsion to consume, spend, and indulge is intensified through hypnopaedia, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, the notion that entire social classes are dominated by another group, is clearly illustrated here. The lower classes remain oblivious to this manipulation, literally 'buying into an ideology that supports that structure' (i.e., capitalism and consumerism). Although the upper classes have the capacity to recognize this, few Alphas or Betas, except characters like Bernard, challenge their status. The interactions between social classes highlight the perceived oppression of capitalism. \n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" relationships between distinct individuals are nonexistent. The novel deliberately avoids giving depth to its characters, even major ones, suggesting perhaps that the combination of technological and capitalist growth strips humans of free will and self-expression. Love and intense emotions are absent; interactions remain shallow, exemplified by men's comments on women's physical attributes (e.g., pneumatic quality) and women's candid remarks on their liaisons. Additionally, each societal class's satisfaction with their place in the hierarchy reflects capitalism's socioeconomic impact. Their unwavering adherence to their role in the community mirrors Marxist views on the proletariat, who are falsely led to believe in their superiority, provided they continue to consume, comply, and conform with their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in an Islam course at CBC. A key point of contention in the class was whether Islam is inherently hostile. I feel this question is even more pertinent now. Reflecting on the time since 9/11, I've noticed a shift in the media's portrayal of Islam—from a hostile stance towards extremists to a more tolerant view of Islam in America. Back in 2001, it seemed unlikely that a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, who has a family background linked to Islam, could emerge.\n\nI find the Biography of the Prophet fascinating because, based on my understanding of Muhammad's history, it seems to contradict his character. Previously, I thought Muhammad compelled people to convert to Islam, conquering tribes and imposing the religion upon them. However, the biography depicts him as a martyr, misunderstood, yet humble, drawing people to his teachings who sought him out for the 'truth.'\n\nFurthermore, there are striking parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad. Notably, there is an account where Muhammad multiplies mutton and milk to feed forty men, reminiscent of biblical miracles. This portrayal suggests the writers intended to present Muhammad as a modest prophet, living in truth and miracles rather than proving himself. This type of narrative, in my view, undermines the miracles and life of Jesus Christ, seemingly appropriating Jesus' legacy through Muhammad.\n\nAdditionally, many stories in the biography aim to provide evidence of people's independent conversion to Islam, yet these accounts often originate from third-party sources. The narrative describes how someone heard from another person, creating a chain of hearsay. This approach was unconvincing to me, as it appeared to weaken the credibility of the stories, making them seem more dubious.\n\nWhat troubles me most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a divine man—humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. Yet, historical accounts challenge the notion of Muhammad as a gentle and humble figure. I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true historical context of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus during his lifetime were quickly set aside as Christian thought evolved after his death. Observing this history broadly, there's a noticeable trend of Christianity diverging from its origins. Presently, there is an increasing awareness and a progressive inclination. While some traditional individuals persist and resist thoughts beyond their learned teachings, they may not be influential enough to sway the majority. Among Christians, historical awareness is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. There will be a widespread desire to separate the doctrines added to Christianity over time from the original intent of its founder. This process might take decades or even centuries, but eventually, there will be a significant reversal in Christian history's trajectory, moving back to its original form. A growing movement will work to strip away layers of doctrine, akin to turning back the clock, until what remains is a representation of what Jesus initially brought to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers intervened. When this trend spreads across the United States and Europe, prompting people to worship as if living during Jesus' time, following only his teachings, the church as an institution will maintain its strength to guide this shift. However, with the theological clock turning backward, the current diversity within Christianity will give way to increased uniformity in beliefs and practices. Across regions, denominations, and divisions, we will witness growing similarities instead of differences. Human history is marked by significant reversions, such as the transformation of the Roman Empire from persecuting Christians to becoming a Christian institution, or the shift in our country from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The forthcoming great reversion will manifest within the Christian religion, reversing history in search of its source, and reducing diversity in the process. A key factor enabling this change will be interpreting Jesus’ words metaphorically rather than literally. So, what has occurred since Jesus' time? Looking back far enough, we find only Judaism, the theological foundation of Christianity. By the time the Romans conquered Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion. The Jewish population was not united, divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I think The Jungle illustrates that at their core, humans are inherently greedy and self-serving. Individuals tend to prioritize their own well-being and improvement, often neglecting those beneath them. This theme is evident throughout The Jungle, particularly in the behavior of the factory owners and managers. Their primary focus is on expanding and elevating their businesses, with little concern for the people or things negatively impacted by their progress. Upton Sinclair describes this vividly, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" highlighting the environmental destruction caused by pollution. Sinclair demonstrates the owners' disregard for anyone or anything harmed by their actions, including the massive smoke emissions and runoff from animal waste in Packingtown.  \n\nMoreover, these owners and managers were indifferent to the plight of their workers who contributed to their wealth. They were willing to employ any means to increase profits, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers endured grueling hours and could be dismissed en masse without notice or compensation. In the era depicted in The Jungle, worker protection laws and regulations were mostly nonexistent, enabling managers and owners to exploit their workers by demanding faster output and imposing harsh working conditions. Although the book does not overtly state it, those living and working in Packingtown were expected to endure these dire conditions both in the factories and their surrounding environment. There were no organizations to assist or inform the laborers. While unions did exist, they often exploited the poor workers financially instead of aiding them. The workers faced such severe mistreatment and systemic entrapment that they were likened to slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is regarded by Edgar Allan Poe as one of his finer poems. In this poem, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott links to Virgil. Virgil referred to an island north of Britain known to the Greeks as the edge of the known world. While Virgil indeed used the term, there is a more contemporary source that deserves recognition. Poe had a keen interest in German authors. This is significant because it demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's work. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" notes the resemblance between their poems, suggesting that Poe was influenced by Goethe. According to the Oxford Companion to English Literature, Goethe was renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Within Faust's second part is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" The poem narrates the story of a king who, after his wife dies and leaves him a goblet, begins drinking excessively and mourning her. Eventually, he decides to die, gives his possessions to his children except for the goblet, and throws it into the sea before dying. The nature of the King of Thule and the portrayal of the king in \"Dream-Land\" are strikingly similar, possibly reflecting a dark parallel to Poe’s own experiences with loss and drinking. \"Faust\" was also adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, shortly before Poe used the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe mentions Thule twice in his works, first as \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" and twice as bookends in \"Dream-Land.\" \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as complementary works. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes Thule's landscape as dark and lonely, haunted by the memories of deceased friends in a colorless world. These scenes resonate with \"The King of Thule,\" where the king, having lost his wife, is solitary and devoid of the will to rule or live. The poem reads as if the speaker steps into Goethe's narrative. Goethe was a prominent author, whom Poe would likely have known about, if not for his respect for Tennyson. Poe acknowledged this when asked about his admiration for Tennyson. Beyond the Tennyson connection, Poe would have encountered Goethe's work through the numerous reproductions following the original publication.",
            "Under California law, can a customer who was hurt after slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store receive punitive damages by demonstrating that the store manager acted with malice, given that he was informed twice about the spill but delayed cleaning it for half an hour because he was having dinner? A judge is unlikely to immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive damages. To justify such damages, a plaintiff must provide evidence that the defendant’s actions were carried out with willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm resulting from those actions, and also show that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have been aware of the potential harm of not cleaning up the spill, as several D&D customers had been injured from slipping incidents in the months before Palmer’s accident; despite this knowledge, he still neglected to address the spill. Palmer’s claim that Martin’s behavior was despicable might be less convincing, but remains reasonable given that six slip-and-fall accidents occurred in 2009, yet Martin still did not take the necessary steps to ensure store safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin replied that he was on a dinner break and \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin about the spill, and he gave the same response. At 5:30 pm on that day, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, suffering a severe back injury. Before Palmer's incident, five other slip-and-fall accidents had been reported at D&D in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damages claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud, or malice.” According to Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010), malice is defined as conduct intended to cause harm, or, without intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and carried out with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” Courts have deemed conduct malicious when done with a conscious disregard for the plaintiff’s rights, where the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "She always felt like something was missing in her life, a longing that never seemed satisfied. This feeling had started when she was about 14, just entering her teenage years, and persisted until she was 17. By then, she realized she was seeking someone rather than something. However, she didn't feel any attraction toward the boys around her. Though some boys had shown interest and awkwardly tried to win her over, none caught her attention. She often questioned herself about this unusual feeling, pondering what could cause such a peculiar situation for a teenage girl. Despite years of reflection, she came up with theories but nothing substantial enough to consider seriously. So, she continued living, constantly questioning her desires.\n\nAt home, the atmosphere was generally peaceful. Her parents were calm and rarely argued, even with her. The only disputes arose from her asserting her independence and free spirit. Despite being the daughter of a composed couple, she contrasted their calmness with her lively and engaging personality, which made her well-liked, especially since she was genuinely nice.\n\nHowever, today was different. As she wandered from room to room, searching for inspiration, she heard a short scream from the kitchen—the sound of her mother's lovely voice. Panic-stricken, she rushed in and anxiously asked, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother on the floor, in apparent pain, breathlessly repeating \"Ow.\" The daughter hurried to her side, trying to help. \"Ouch ... sweetie, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital,\" her mother said, her words strained. Realizing the severity of the situation, she agreed, asking where she could pick her up. Her mother gestured, and in that moment, the daughter was grateful for the strength she had built through her classes. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the backseat, and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital visit was filled with the scents of disinfectant and illness, underscored by fear. But she was too focused on aiding her mother to notice. She swiftly carried her inside, calling for medical help. Concerned faces gathered, and someone quickly brought a rolling bed to place her mother on. They took her away for immediate examination, leaving the daughter to sit and worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off a stepping stool while trying to retrieve a vase from their tallest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that closely following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet is a variation of the Med diet, marked by increased consumption of plant-based foods, such as plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (in preference to saturated fats), and fish, along with reduced intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is also part of the diet.\n\nEarlier prospective studies have shown a negative correlation between adherence to a Med diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. Additionally, an intervention trial revealed that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, previous studies did not specifically focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Between 1984 and 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) meant to evaluate nutrient intake over the preceding year. More than 95% of the nurses remained participants over the 20-year duration. The FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, cases were categorized as \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions falling into this category. For each FFQ, factors like body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated, and starting in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was evaluated.\n\nTo minimize random variation for individuals and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were computed (by averaging scores from the previous two years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could skew results) by controlling for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to assess the relationship between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for both fatal and nonfatal CHD and types of stroke.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a reduced risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over a 20-year follow-up, there were 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 new cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (including both fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "A sign reads, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Ellen Page, known for her role in *Juno*, stands alone at a street corner holding a cardboard sign with this disturbing message written in Sharpie. Burma, also called Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation controlled by a repressive military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, the country saw its first public demonstrations in a decade, led by a significant number of Burmese monks. These protests, named \"The Saffron Revolution\" after the color of the monks' robes, initially drew public attention. While the government initially tolerated these peaceful gatherings, violence soon escalated into what many viewed as a war between the monks and the military junta, which began attacking monasteries nationwide. Foreign journalists were detained on sight, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed on September 27, 2007, for covering a protest. Officially, 13 people were reported dead, but Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army shortly before the official report, claimed that the death toll was in the thousands.\n\nSuch events are not new. While these are some recent examples of global atrocities, the drive of governments to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over citizens has existed since the dawn of civilization. Early Roman emperors claimed divine selection for absolute rule over their societies. Japanese emperors were believed to be gods sent to guide their people toward prosperity, and the then-current U.S. president, George W. Bush, reportedly had regular conference calls with Ted Haggard, leading a group humorously termed \"Stupid People Worldwide,\" affiliated with the Republican Party.\n\nSome well-known historical instances of similar actions include the Tiananmen Square protests on June 4, 1989, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students protested the authoritarian government. The death toll is disputed, with Chinese government reports stating 200-300 dead, while the Chinese Red Cross estimated 2,000-3,000 fatalities. Another example is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias, supported by the Rwandan government, systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of their ethnicities. Hitler’s 'Third Reich' is another extreme case, during which people of Jewish descent were systematically rounded up and killed across multiple countries.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting impact on jazz is largely attributed to his long career and his exceptional ability to mold his orchestra creatively. While his piano presence is understated in many compositions chosen for this analysis, as a composer, Ellington was adept at crafting intricate and sophisticated pieces that highlighted the unique talents of his band members. He designed frameworks that allowed soloists to improvise freely, alongside tightly orchestrated sections that utilized the distinct styles of his musicians to bring musical ideas to the forefront. By doing so, he elevated the overall tone of the orchestra, producing cohesive and original sounds tailored for each composition. Ellington's skill in understanding the individual sounds of his players and how they synergized within the ensemble enabled him to compose some of jazz's most groundbreaking and impressive works.\n\nAccording to the Grove Music dictionary, Ellington's use of sound and innovation is exemplified in \"Creole Love Call,\" where he employed the voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This early work showcases his method of using voice to add texture and color without relying on lyrics. \"Creole Love Call\" also highlights Ellington's talent for complementing his soloists' styles, a consistent feature throughout his career. This deliberate twelve-bar blues piece includes six choruses, as detailed below:\n- Chorus 1: A call and response between voice and reeds, beginning with a smooth, melodic voice that shifts to a rougher tone.\n- Chorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the main melody, accentuating several extended blue notes.\n- Chorus 3: A high-register clarinet solo accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n- Chorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus through a call and response between the brass and reed sections.\n- Chorus 5: The piece's climactic section, where high-register reeds initiate the call and response, supported by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.\n- Chorus 6: Returns to the structure of the first chorus with call and response between voice and reeds, featuring the voice using a “growl” technique, acting as a solo instrument.\n- Tag: A brief conclusion with a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to introduce a new layer of tonal color in this piece is a hallmark of his style. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington combines his prowess in tight orchestration with his sensitivity to tone color. A call and response sequence between \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing blends the vocal qualities of Miley’s trumpet with the instrumental nature of Cox’s voice to produce a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" further develops these concepts, showcasing Ellington’s strategic use of Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a key member of Ellington's orchestra, who effectively introduces the melody on a muted trombone.",
            "What causes organisms to evolve in the specific ways they do? Are there limitations or constraints that guide evolutionary changes? In 1917, D’Arcy Thompson remarked that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" and this observation still holds true today. In recent years, mathematical modeling has been utilized to examine general aspects of mollusk shell formation across both individual development (ontogeny) and evolutionary history (phylogeny) (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of developmental and evolutionary changes in the Prunum genus, alongside experimental studies, can help clarify the mechanisms driving the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental change. We employed X-ray images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters, which were then used to model both theoretical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters were input into the software CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We created models of possible shell shapes to explore the limits of morphological change in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to enhance our understanding of macroevolutionary events within this group.\n\nA shell can be conceptualized as a cylindrical structure that rotates over time through 360 degrees of space. These rotations or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, spiraling around an imaginary central axis. This axis, which runs through the shell's central column, is known as the columella. The rate at which the whorls increase in size can differ, and a continuous line called a suture separates each whorl. Typically, the largest whorl is the final one, known as the body whorl. The spire consists of all the whorls except the last one. The apex is the tip of the spire, with the base at the opposite end. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The \"usual\" orientation is the apertural view, where the aperture faces the viewer and the apex points upward.)\n\nThe method for counting whorls is as follows. First, observe the shell from the apical view and identify the start of the first suture. Then, draw a line dividing the shell into two sections. Whorls are counted from this line and estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a sequence of apertures moving through time and space as the organism builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced using coordinates of each whorl's aperture center, along with the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented both graphically and mathematically. Once formulated mathematically, it becomes possible to adjust parameters and alter the mollusk's shell formation process.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have not shown significant change. Although the country is progressing toward several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, the pace of improvement in child and maternal health is insufficient to achieve the set targets by 2015. Various reasons for these deficiencies will be explored, highlighting a need to fortify the health system rather than focusing solely on specific programs. \n\nIndonesia has seen progress in the number of births attended by qualified health personnel, reaching 72%. However, this figure includes traditional practitioners like midwives who may not perform necessary medical procedures during complicated pregnancies, which contributes to high maternal mortality from hemorrhage. Thus, the perceived progress in this indicator may be misleading, and substantial work remains. Moreover, there's been a reduction in the percentage of children under five with diarrhea receiving professional medical treatment. Although data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is evidently an area of concern due to low nationwide rates.\n\nCesarean section rates remain low, around 4%, and reveal further issues. The rate is 7% in urban areas but only 2% in rural ones, indicating unequal healthcare access, which is mainly concentrated in urban centers. Another access issue involves vertical equity, with a 27% disparity in service use between the poorest and wealthiest groups, suggesting that the poor face greater challenges in accessing healthcare, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn contemplating the next steps to enhance neonatal and maternal healthcare metrics, the primary question is how to effectively address the service gaps. Should Indonesia adopt program-specific strategies or focus on strengthening the entire health system without concentrating solely on maternal and child care? Programmatic approaches are appealing as they offer targeted, manageable goals and generally yield quicker results. However, there are pitfalls to consider. A significant downside is that focusing resources on one health sector can detract from others, drawing human resources to the well-funded area (similar to how international funding for HIV/AIDS has impacted family planning). Moreover, running multiple overlapping programs for a single sector can lead to service duplication and lack of coordination, increasing administrative burdens for supplies and funding.",
            "Over the last century, the classification of popular music has expanded to such an extent that listing all its genres is nearly impossible. Adding to the complexity, nearly every genre—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—has developed numerous sub-genres and even sub-sub-genres. Among these, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock stands out as one of the most diverse and expressive within popular music over the past 40 years. It is considered expressive because it conveys a broad spectrum of emotions, often gravitating toward darker themes. Its diversity stems from the early realization of its flexibility, which encouraged people to create their own sub-genres, spawning further sub-sub-genres—a trend that continues today.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal scene is so fragmented into various niches that defining what heavy metal truly is has become challenging. It has absorbed numerous themes from other genres, yet, like all genres, it originated somewhere. To fully comprehend the metal music that pervades the contemporary scene, one must first grasp what the metal movement is and why it is regarded as a movement rather than merely a genre.\n\nIn many respects, metal is a movement characterized by darkness. It is often described as \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more theatricality. It features less primitivism and more technical skill, with musicians in metal bands demonstrating remarkable proficiency with their instruments, which is evident in their music. Unsurprisingly, metal is also a movement deeply influenced by drug use. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-70s led to increasingly wild and surreal music, with drugs often cited as catalysts for creativity. Metal possesses numerous dark, visceral elements, a novel feature in a music scene where much popular music did not typically explore the darker emotional spectrum. Furthermore, later generations of metal drew inspiration from the dark, visceral elements prominent during the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as those from \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles illustrate the darkness integral to the movement.\n\nThese lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" reveal the darker tendencies of the Beatles, reflecting a tumultuous experience, possibly influenced by drugs. This song is considered by some as one of the first Heavy Metal tracks. It was a counter to a Rolling Stones song that was also heavy and dark. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate that they could match the Stones' intensity, leading them to include the song on The White Album.",
            "Several decades prior to the emergence of Surrealist artists and their dreamlike creations, Henri Rousseau was meticulously constructing his own dreams, both metaphorically and literally. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only showcases a woman marveling at the wonders of a dreamland but also symbolizes Rousseau's personal aspirations and ambitions as a painter. From the outset of his career, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from his fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet he found himself grappling with an internal conflict in pursuing this goal. The Dream encapsulates Rousseau's ongoing struggle throughout his career: whether to adapt to or imitate certain artistic styles to gain acceptance in the critical art world he cherished, or to remain creatively independent and distinct, forging his own path.\n\nTo analyze The Dream from this perspective, one must first understand Rousseau's biography. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware merchant who \"enjoyed bourgeois prosperity\" (Shattuck 47). Lacking formal artistic training, he worked for the French municipal toll service, known as a gabelou, until age forty, although he was mistakenly called a douanier, or customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The loss of his first wife, Clémence, following the deaths of eight infants, left Rousseau with only one surviving child, his daughter Julia, and deep sorrow (Shattuck 49). Seeking solace, he turned to painting for comfort and a fresh start. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized peasants in art, Rousseau was fundamentally a folk painter with dreams and aspirations akin to the average person of his class.\n\nRousseau's yearning for acceptance in the art world is somewhat understandable given his circumstances: he was not only self-taught and began his career later in life, but he was also creating art during the same period as many other renowned modern artists. Despite years of work, Rousseau did not achieve significant recognition until around the time Matisse was becoming established as an artist. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes that although the two were technically competitors, they differed in both style and their motivations for painting: \"Matisse feared painting in a clichéd manner, while Rousseau aimed to create a piece so conventional that he would be accepted by the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "Numerous esteemed thinkers have suggested a close link between ethics and aesthetics, or truth and beauty. I am convinced there is a fundamental reason for this. As John Keats expresses in “Ode on a Grecian Urn,” “Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we learn in life comes through education or experience. However, as Keats hints, we seem to understand ethics and aesthetics inherently, without traditional instruction. Both fields strive to describe rather than dictate. Our exploration of morality and beauty usually seeks to explain why art or literature is beautiful or why an act is moral, rather than providing a rulebook for creating good art or moral behavior. Moreover, critiques of art or morals often fail to fully encapsulate what makes something good or beautiful. Discussing the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might involve terms like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't ultimately explain why it's good art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often say, “There's just something about it” before offering a more detailed critique. I believe art and morals cannot be completely distilled into descriptions of their attributes. As Flannery O'Connor states, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how thoroughly we describe a literary work's features, something transcendent remains. I believe ethics shares this quality. Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.” I propose that this “something,” this je ne sais quoi, is the most powerful aspect of art and morality, and this transcendental nature links ethics and aesthetics. I think morality and art are deeply connected because we experience them profoundly at a noumenal level, a term borrowed from Kant. They affect us in ways that can be felt but not fully articulated. This connection is even more pronounced in literature. As McKean states, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Modern-day Germany is recognized as a powerful and unified nation, showcasing a unique cultural blend that stretches from the alpine shadows in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This cultural essence is also evident from Cologne on the Rhine River, through central Germany, to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given this distinctive culture, it's no surprise that Germany as we know it today stems from various sources and tribes.\n\nThe ancestral land of the Germans is known as Germania, though the origin of its name is a topic of great debate among scholars and historians. Tacitus suggested that the name originated from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were previously referred to as Germans before crossing the Rhine and engaging with the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar was the first to use the term “Germanus” in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, where he subdued the Gauls and fought with Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine under dubious circumstances. He adopted this term from the Gauls to differentiate between those he had conquered (the Gauls) and those he had not. While the exact origin is unclear, some propose it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar noted: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others suggest the name comes from the spear, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), used in warfare, or possibly from the Old Irish word garim, meaning “to shout,” indicating that the Germans were loud or noisy. (Names of Germany)\n\nIn his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum,” the early Roman historian Tacitus documented the origins of the Germans, stating, “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd who would abandon Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, at least not at that time. They would extend their conquests into Germania for goods and occasionally launch land campaigns, but ultimately they returned to their expansive empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the middle of the first century, they resided on the fringes of the Roman Empire, trading goods from the land and offering their skills by serving in the Roman army ranks (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "The play Twelfth Night suggests that while disguises can effectively enable prolonged deception, eventually one must abandon this false identity to avoid losing their true self. A major issue with ending such deception is the potential for feeling isolated. Ultimately, a person must choose between preserving their own identity or maintaining relationships with others. Some people may react indifferently to being deceived, but others might not be so forgiving and may feel offended by the charade.\n\nThe theme of deception in gender role reversal is particularly complex, raising questions, notably why someone feels compelled to adopt a disguise of the opposite gender. For Viola, this disguise is a means of self-preservation: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Arriving in an unfamiliar land, Viola chooses to disguise herself as a man to protect against potential threats. While her plan succeeds, it also isolates her from the women around her, depriving her of vital support. Complicating matters, her disguise is so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, Viola must contend with unspoken romantic feelings between herself and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261).\n\nTo a contemporary audience, Twelfth Night might illustrate how deception can reveal hidden emotions, particularly for Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest these characters confront subconscious desires brought to light by Viola/Cesario’s appearance. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario because of the male guise, or does she secretly have feelings for women? It is more plausible that Shakespeare’s character Olivia satirizes people of his era who judge others solely on appearance. This is shown by how easily Olivia shifts her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, viewing Cesario/Viola as family rather than a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "Various observers have highlighted the brutality of German colonial rule, especially regarding the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa. However, describing an entire colonial empire with a single characteristic would be overly simplistic. The German colonial empire was diverse in its policies and governance, as well as in its geographical spread. Education across the colonies was equally varied. When the British took control of German East Africa (now Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a large number of educated and literate Africans. German educational endeavors in Kamerun and other colonies were also commended by writers of the time. \n\nIn contrast, the situation in South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) was markedly different. Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and actively participated in the education of the indigenous people, in South West Africa, education for the natives was largely entrusted to missionary societies with minimal government backing. However, the government did allocate significant resources for the education of Europeans in the colony, setting up state schools and offering more substantial support and oversight to missionary schools. These educational policies left lasting impacts on South West Africa even after German colonial rule ended. While other German colonies had notable numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" A variety of social, political, and economic factors contributed to the unique experience of South West Africa. This paper aims to delve deeper by identifying these factors and focusing on new research regarding the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is extensive literature specifically addressing education in the German colonial empire. Most of these sources are in German and were composed in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the era of German colonial rule. The primary aim of early works was to describe the characteristics of educational systems in these colonies. Later English-language writings broadened the discussion through comparative studies of education in various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work explicitly addressing this paper's topic is Cohen’s study on education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and examines the factors contributing to their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa accounts for many of the distinctive features of the colony’s educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonial holdings, South West Africa had a somewhat temperate climate, though much of the area is covered by arid desert. The European population in South West Africa mirrored these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 white people resided in South West Africa, while the next largest settler population, in East Africa, had only 5,336.",
            "The United States and Mexico exemplify a longstanding rivalry that persisted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, acquiring Texas and the American Southwest. Numerous other conflicts occurred between the two countries, gradually diminishing just before World War I. The discord began over significant issues, including religion, culture, tradition, and conflicting material interests (Schmitt 1974, pp. 30-31). \n\nThis situation is similar to many other nations with enduring rivalries with neighboring countries. Nations sharing borders often experience conflicting interests, leading to rival positions. The United States and Mexico's rivalry is akin to many other long-standing border disputes. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, both nations' geographic proximity to the United States has made them rivals, while other Latin American countries have generally maintained good relations with the U.S. \n\nReligious differences contributed to the discord between the two nations, a common historical issue. Sally Frahm (2001) remarks that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86). Much like the ideological and interest-based rivalry of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, the U.S.-Mexico conflict involved ideological struggles rooted in religious preferences rather than political structures. This distrust stemmed from the historical animosity between the English and Spanish, inherited from their colonial pasts, which hindered positive foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identify 17 disputes between the U.S. and Mexico during their 57-year rivalry, mostly involving territorial issues related to border raids and frontier problems. Bandit raids from American border towns remained a significant issue until both nations applied military force along their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97). Schmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry began to subside as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109), eventually ending when American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the late 19th century (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was unexpectedly and abruptly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. At the time, I was working as a nurse, a career I chose because of my deep-seated need for the safety and security I lacked in childhood. I often heard the mantra, \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick,\" as I grew up. Despite dreaming of being a scientist or journalist, or both, I chose nursing.\n\nThen, at 46, I found myself single, with little savings, and unable to work. Even now, I remain disabled, living for 15 years on Social Security Disability with nothing I can truly call my own. I manage, but each day is a struggle, challenging my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Although nothing in my life is guaranteed anymore, one truth remains: I couldn't have survived all these years without the support of my family and a few good friends, regardless of my strength. When genuine disaster strikes, you don't feel very strong.\n\nMy point is that life will always have emergencies, big or small. There are no guarantees, and some challenges are too great to face alone, no matter how prepared you are.\n\nI fully agree that in the U.S., we need to stop relying solely on big government; clearly, it's deteriorating. However, I'd prefer to see Americans learning to trust and support one another, rather than each of us building fallout shelters in our backyards.\n\nConservatives in the U.S. often speak of the \"rugged individualism\" that built our nation, but in reality, what sustained our ancestors during tough times was compassion, mutual respect, and resource-sharing. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't reach the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, plastic sheeting, and duct tape for the windows in case of a biological attack. I have several flashlights, various batteries, plenty of candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have land and resources for a small farm and can preserve your food, do it. It's a great idea, as is having a wood stove, as long as you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while doing all this, make sure to get to know your neighbors.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he forsook worldly attachments and achieved enlightenment, his teachings eventually giving rise to Buddhism. The most traditional branch of Buddhism is Theravada Buddhism. This religion, now about 2,500 years old, has evolved since Buddha's time. This evolution is evident in places like Sri Lanka, a Theravada Buddhist nation, where the annual water-cutting ceremony takes place. Both monks and laypeople partake in this event, which holds religious significance despite not being directly taught by Buddha. Such changes span from surface-level traditions to the core doctrines of the religion. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community, encompassing both monastic and lay perspectives, has had to adapt its principles due to various internal and external influences, both supportive and adverse.\n\nSeveral key terms will be used throughout this discussion. \"Internal\" refers to influences arising from members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of their monastic status, while \"external\" refers to influences from non-Buddhists. A \"hostile\" force is one that harms or intends to harm the Buddhist community, often stemming from negative views of Buddhism. A \"benign\" force neither harms nor helps the community directly, though it may inadvertently do either. These terms will become relevant repeatedly in the discussion.\n\nTo begin, it's essential to understand the foundational doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists find refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially made up of the Tripitaka, or the \"three baskets\" of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the rules of discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. The metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (the inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Understanding these ideas is crucial to ending Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which is continuous. Ending Sansara also means overcoming lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) upon enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka establishes rules for living. Laypeople are expected to follow five precepts: not to kill, lie, steal, engage in sexual misconduct, or consume intoxicating substances. Monks adhere to many additional rules. The most fundamental concept in Buddhism is the four noble truths: first, Dukkha, the reality that life involves suffering; second, that attachment leads to suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome."
