            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture is a crucial factor in any negotiation, as it can be understood by both what it encompasses and what it doesn't. Culture is not uniform or a single entity, nor is it a specific trait. Generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are overly simplistic and broad. While knowing cultural generalizations can be useful, it is more beneficial for a negotiator to grasp how the culture influences the negotiation context and how it might impact the discussions. When encountering a foreign culture, individuals often relate it to their own, leading to comparisons.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset may require exploring its history and acknowledging its biases. Instead of judging or trying to alter a culture, it is crucial to accept it as it is and operate within its confines, particularly in negotiations, especially when one has a weaker bargaining position. Similarly, showing respect for traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and advance the negotiation when a negotiator is on foreign ground.\n\nIt's also essential to recognize that culture extends beyond national or international boundaries. Companies within the same country often develop their own corporate culture. For example, a company might prioritize long working hours or a more flexible schedule. Corporate culture can be observed through employee dress codes, communication styles (direct or indirect), and hiring practices. Some companies promote philanthropy at all levels, while others limit it to \"company-approved\" charities or events. The differences in American corporate culture from one company to another (and even within regions or between urban and suburban areas) illustrate the diversity of thought within a societal culture. Some cultures may seem less stratified than American culture and appear more uniform to outsiders, but this similarity is merely an invitation to explore further.\n\nUnderstanding values is even more critical, as they explain the reasons behind a culture's behaviors. In cultures that value saving face or communal harmony, negotiators are unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superiors to succeed. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that prioritizes hard bargaining may not be eager to settle quickly. Considering these generalities is vital before entering negotiations. However, it is advantageous for a negotiator to also learn about their counterpart on a personal level to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "The phrase \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God,’\" originally appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and serves as the starting point for St. Anselm’s discussion on God's existence. This perspective is also shared by Thomas Aquinas, another author we will examine. Since both authors argue in favor of the same idea, and our task is to assess which argument is superior, we will assume for brevity's sake that both authors are correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God described in the Bible. Allowing for a different concept of God would prevent a proper comparison of their arguments, as both are essentially defending the same idea of God. However, while both authors present valid points, neither offers a comprehensive foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo explore this, we will first consider St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm emphasizes understanding through faith, suggesting that one can find evidence of God within oneself. He argues that because God exists in our understanding, we cannot truly imagine His nonexistence. Although his explanation can be complex and sometimes unclear, the central idea is that proof of God resides in one's mind. Anselm suggests that we don't need external evidence to find truth about God; the truth of God's existence can be discovered by examining what we inherently know to be true within ourselves. This acceptance of something without irrefutable empirical evidence is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas argues that God's existence can be demonstrated solely through reason and empirical evidence, without the need for faith. This approach is advantageous in evangelism, a key aspect of Christianity, as it allows for the conversion of new believers based on logic alone, without requiring them to accept something unproven. Aquinas presents five logical arguments to support God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each case, he essentially shows that the necessity of God is a logical conclusion. Just as knowing one puzzle piece is missing allows you to deduce its features and existence without seeing it, logic leads to the conclusion of God's existence.",
            "Numerous authors employ various methods to evoke specific emotions or attitudes in their readers regarding significant topics. Some of these methods are more impactful than others. In his novel, The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes several such techniques. Occasionally, Fitzgerald combines an adjective and a noun in an unconventional manner to create a particular atmosphere around a subject. At other times, he assigns meaning to a symbol and uses it for a similar purpose. He notably employs this latter technique with colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald develops meanings for colors, especially white/gray and red/pink, and later uses these meanings to evoke a specific feeling related to an important object.\n\nFor white/gray, Fitzgerald creates a meaning of uniformity, with white representing something slightly nicer and of higher class, and gray symbolizing something older and more faded. This meaning is established early in the novel through frequent use of these colors. Daisy and Jordan are often described as being “in white” (8)—indeed, many characters wear white: Nick dons “white flannels” (41) for Gatsby’s party, Tom wears a “white shirt” (36) when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). The only instance where white is not present is when Nick observes Gatsby’s party, where “the halls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these colors by applying them to ordinary, insignificant subjects: Nick commutes “down the white chasms of lower New York” (56), the names on Gatsby’s party guest list appear as “gray names” (61) on Nick’s timetable, and Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—symbolizing uniformity (28). He also describes ordinary people or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy shared a “white girlhood” (19), there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of ashes, the “Italian child” on the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established the meaning of white/gray, he uses these colors to indicate unimportance or uniformity in certain subjects. This use of color to convey meaning begins with Daisy. After a significant gap in the use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster,” leading readers to perceive Daisy as less of a character and more of a uniform element, something Gatsby desires (74). Fitzgerald further employs this technique around Daisy to suggest her as a uniform element, such as the “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is once more in a “white” (115) dress before the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",

Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Moreover, numerous organic farms offer tours of their farming operations and provide opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. Such operations enable landowners to benefit from government programs while simultaneously enhancing habitats, allowing for recreational use, and creating avenues for farm tours and educational purposes, which can generate income.\n\nBy tapping into a potentially lucrative niche market, organic farming also promotes greater biodiversity among plants and wildlife, as it avoids the use of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming can incur higher costs than conventional farming. It demands more labor and management to control pests and weeds and to fertilize without chemicals, often resulting in greater losses compared to conventional methods. Small organic farms also lack the economies of scale that larger operations benefit from. Practices that are beneficial to wildlife but not necessarily related to organic farming can also increase labor costs, such as planting cover crops, rotating grazing strategically, removing invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create specific habitats like edge areas or open ground patches. Hence, there are various reasons why a landowner in this situation might seek financial assistance or expert advice to maximize profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land selected for this example is a 160-acre parcel near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It consists of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. It is situated in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which is still under review but currently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many species, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, are endangered, while others like burrowing owls are declining and may soon be listed.\n\nHistorically, Native Americans inhabited this area for countless centuries before it was later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This tract of land was part of an original homestead patent and likely used for grazing or wood production over the years.\n\nI chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to explore the options a small farmer might have to reduce costs and maintain wildlife-friendly practices. To model what farming on this land might achieve, I identified an organic farm in the same vicinity.",
            "There exists a strong connection between brothers; one that is unbreakable and permanent. This connection encompasses a range of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, among others. Brothers have a deep understanding of each other, more so than anyone else connected in this way, and they see a reflection of themselves in one another. The true nature of this bond becomes evident in critical situations, whether for better or worse. When these emotions surface, they come at a significant cost. Understanding the emotions that spring from this brotherly link involves dealing with the outcomes they produce. When a person can look into their brother's eyes and see their own reflection, they perceive themselves not as others do, but as they truly are. Their true character is revealed through their actions and the consequences that follow. In “The Scarlet Ibis,” two brothers delve into this theme and the turbulent emotions that come with it. Against a richly detailed backdrop, these two boys embark on an ultimately futile journey. In the climax, bitter disappointment meets intense pride, and only one brother survives. The theme is conveyed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, their interactions, and the narrator’s perspective, which communicates the protagonist's complex emotions and his perception of the world, both of which greatly influence his actions. The protagonist’s actions are driven by one main emotion: pride. From the moment he and his younger brother, Doodle, go out together, to their final, tragic outing, the protagonist harbors resentment toward Doodle. He had hoped for a brother to whom he could teach various skills, like \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp.\" He wanted a sibling who could be his companion in races to Horsehead Landing and someone to sit with at the top of the great pine behind the barn. However, due to Doodle’s frail heart, surviving was uncertain, and participating in strenuous physical activities was nearly impossible. The young protagonist’s dreams were shattered instantly, which was a significant disappointment. He even admits to feeling anger towards Doodle, once considering suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would contemplate such an act? Yet, his heart softened when Doodle smiled at him, a simple act that filled him with hope. This indicates that his resolve was not very strong — deep down, he had an innate love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex and inventive system for processing information. As technology evolved from rudimentary to sophisticated, so did the metaphors used to describe the brain. It was first likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, a book, and most recently, a computer. When studying the brain, remember that these metaphors have limitations and can lead to incorrect assumptions.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory organ input, which converts physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light photons into electrochemical signals. The brain's algorithms repeatedly transform this sensory information through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles basic information such as color, orientation, and edges—where color shifts abruptly over a short distance—to determine that a box is present. Top-down processing then uses decisions from earlier bottom-up steps to expedite recognition of the box. In this case, top-down processing might help identify the object as a black box instead of a box-shaped void in the white background.\n\nAfter a certain level of processing, an attention filter evaluates the signal's significance and determines which cognitive processes it should be accessible to. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you glance at your shoes, a healthy attention filter keeps you from noticing each one individually. Conversely, you might notice your name spoken even in a noisy room. There are multiple stages of processing, and attention repeatedly influences the results.\n\nBefore the brain can process information, it must be stored. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded, with specific encoding methods for each type of sensory input. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally (appearance of the printed word), phonemically (the sound of the word), or semantically (the meaning of the word). Once stored, information must be maintained. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which retains information for around 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons temporarily. Long-term memory is thought to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are several models for organizing knowledge in the brain, some based on how humans recall memories, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that nodes represent concepts, with links based on relatedness. For instance, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which could connect to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States was engulfed by a severe financial crisis. Unemployment soared, the housing market collapsed, and numerous major corporations in the country were left devastated. This recession continues today, prompting questions about its origins and prevention measures. Essentially, the crisis resulted from shortsighted and self-serving political decisions that compelled banks and firms to issue subprime loans within an underdeveloped and inadequate financial framework. Concurrently, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were urged to underwrite and repurpose these mortgages into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit default swaps (CDS). When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves, spreading the disarray to these repackaged mortgages and ultimately affecting the broader economy.\n\nThe financial crisis traces back to 1999 during President Clinton's era, as he sought to secure a second term by boosting his popularity. To achieve this, the Clinton administration eased lending restrictions, setting the stage for the subprime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes accurately predicted the potential consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As outlined earlier, and as Holmes predicted, reckless lending was bound to lead to economic collapse.\n\nNumerous factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the complex nature of mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years leading to the crisis, further entangling various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This overexposure made U.S. households and financial markets highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nThe housing bubble inevitably burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in these mortgage-backed securities at a loss. In 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts, representing about 30% of the nation's GDP. Ultimately, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at low prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to transform into commercial banks under stringent regulation. Fannie and Freddie amassed $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That part of your story where you spread your writer's wings and soar, impressing everyone with your captivating, even enchanting prose. Or perhaps it's the section where your readers drift off or hit the \"Back\" button while muttering curses under their breath. Dr. Merlin is known to shout at her screen when she encounters an overload of information, and not in an enjoyable way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy gentle readers are familiar with the basic writing advice, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself trapped in lengthy passages where nothing happens, or there's too much going on. Exposition is that little devil on your shoulder urging you to lay out the history to get to the exciting parts (not to be confused with the devil on the other shoulder encouraging the author to reveal every detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition involves telling the audience what occurred, often in straightforward prose. In films, exposition happens when one character dumps a load of information on another, reminiscent of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nAn illustration is needed. As you read a story, you're informed that the heroine met her beloved at a certain place and time, they wed in a grand manner, and her husband was murdered before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to unfold over two pages, with both having only two lines of dialogue each. You'd expect the author to explore the husband's character, showing through his speech and actions how much he loves his wife, and you'd also expect the heroine to demonstrate in various ways how his presence transformed and enriched her life (especially if the story later explicitly states this). A thorough introduction to the husband's character would engage you emotionally with his fate and provide insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, the depth of their bond, and hints about her thoughts and dreams reflected through his perspective, among other things. You would mourn his death with her, thus growing more connected to the heroine.\n\nIn summary, you'd expect more depth on the simple storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to add that depth. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, continues*) Sometimes, the temptation is to rush through certain elements. Maybe you're introducing a new character and know he used to be in the Air Force, is now the night manager of a gas station, was married twice, has no kids, enjoys fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was a live broadcast from NBC 4 on the morning of August 13, 2011. The main story covered a man named Shad Hostettler in Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife multiple times. Even though they didn't mention her name, they showed Hostettler's mug shot, portraying him as quite menacing. The report on this developing story lasted about two minutes, which I felt was appropriate given the circumstances. \n\nThe second story involved an early morning shooting victim, 18-year-old Travis Buyers, who was critically injured in the Sharon Woods area. At the time, there were no arrests or suspects, and the SWAT Team was investigating. This report was brief, and I suspect that might be because the victim was a black man or from a black neighborhood. I've noticed, over the years, that crimes involving minorities often receive less media attention compared to similar incidents involving white victims. \n\nAnother story discussed the discovery of a bullet hole in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details included the location of the suspected incident and that a .22 caliber rifle bullet was responsible. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the shooter. \n\nThe forecast for rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon was also mentioned. Temperatures were expected to stay in the mid to low 80s over the weekend. This segment was brief, likely intended as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in. \n\nThey also reported on a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus, describing the suspect as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie, approximately six feet tall and weighing around 150 pounds. I found it odd that they emphasized the suspect's race and skin tone so much. \n\nAnother segment covered Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin, involved in a conspiracy to distribute large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, instead of saying he was sentenced to 25 years in prison, they stated \"300 months,\" which seemed to be intended to sound harsher. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, which I didn't think was relevant to the story.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of security that aims to track the performance of an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund. However, unlike index funds, ETFs offer greater flexibility as they are traded like stocks on exchanges. ETFs allow investors to enjoy the diversification benefits of an index fund while also providing the advantages of individual stock ownership, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as few as one share per transaction. Although these features are highly appealing, ETFs typically have much lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund. On the downside, trading ETFs incurs a commission fee, similar to stock trades. Another advantage of ETFs is the wide range of funds available. Despite these benefits being clearly outlined, it is wise for astute investors to assess whether the claimed benefits, such as diversification, truly exist and to what degree. For this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to evaluate if the advantages of owning a single ETF are comparable to possessing a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, and whether there might be better configurations of these stocks to achieve an optimal Sharpe ratio or return.  \nTo assess the ETF, we will focus on the top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's total assets, as including every holding would be impractical. The top 10 holdings and their asset percentages are listed below.  \nTo estimate how well these ten stocks represent the entire ETF IHF, we can use their current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate each stock's contribution to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consists solely of these 10 stocks in the proportions set by the ETF. The Beta and return calculations are provided in the chart below.  \nThe chart shows that a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings yields a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, translating to a 16% increase in returns. It also shows that the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the entire ETF. Based on these results, a portfolio comprising just the top 10 holdings could potentially offer higher returns with a lower beta. However, it's possible that the means of these two portfolios might not differ significantly from each other statistically.  \nTo determine if these portfolios are statistically different, we calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their combined standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Referring to Figure 17, there was a sharp decline in commuter log submissions during the project's third month, which was somewhat disheartening, and the reasons for this are unclear. The arrival of winter on a New England campus likely led to fewer people commuting by bicycle or on foot, contributing to the decrease. December also signifies the end of the fall semester when everyone is preoccupied with completing schoolwork and processing grades, possibly causing the commuter log to be overlooked. Additionally, December ushers in the busy holiday season and a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many do not need to come to campus. Classes resume for the spring semester in late January, which might explain the low number of logs for that month. However, this doesn't fully account for the low submissions in February. It is possible that projects of this nature experience an initial surge of enthusiasm that naturally wanes over time. To counter this trend, we initiated the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a focused campaign that successfully boosted log submissions for that month. Thus, one challenge was maintaining project momentum despite a natural decline in engagement, along with the specific issue of holiday and semester breaks in higher education. \n\nAnother challenge for this project, or any alternative commuting project, is the widespread preference for the freedom, independence, and flexibility that driving offers, which is deeply ingrained in our culture. Therefore, it is crucial to provide incentives for alternative commuting. We offered numerous prizes, such as gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see the impact of larger prizes on participation, such as a bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car, which might have helped address the dip in engagement. The nature of the prizes remained consistent throughout the project. If the prize value had increased over time, it might have helped. The gift cards seemed sufficient at the project's start, but announcing the addition of bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January might have boosted participation and engagement instead of seeing a decline.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films typically utilize creative editing to create illusions. My film analysis primarily focused on defining the stylistic elements of most trick films and investigating the unique features found in some of the later ones. Generally, trick films from the turn of the century are confined to a set, structured within a frontal proscenium, lack camera movement, use long and medium shots, and follow the one shot = one film principle. However, a few films from the early 1900s deviate from these norms by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA key characteristic shared by these films is their use of an indoor set framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary in its proscenium position, not following figures or objects. This style was prevalent in early cinema, influenced by theater and, in trick films, vaudeville and magic performances. A limitation of this stage setup is that characters in trick films generally move side-to-side, avoiding movement toward or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move horizontally. Even when they exit the frame, the camera remains still.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition also results in predominantly long shots, with medium shots being less common. Close-ups are absent from any of the Edison trick films. This mirrors the theater and vaudeville tradition, where audiences view the entire performance at once, framed by the stage. In early films, actors do not approach the camera from the middle distance, so close-ups are not used.\n\nMost early trick films adhere to the principle that one conceptual shot constitutes the entire film. This confines the duration of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. It also limits the narrative potential of the films, which mostly focus on brief vaudeville-style tricks like magic, disappearing acts, and transformations with minimal storytelling. However, in trick films, a single conceptual shot is not necessarily one physical shot. A \"shot\" may consist of several shots combined to create illusions of appearing or disappearing. For instance, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a close examination shows where the physical shot starts with Mary's \"head\" being removed, though to the viewer, the film appears as a single conceptual shot.",
            "Ian Watt, in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel,\" refers to the traditional \"Gothic Novel\" as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" highlighting its contradictory nature both in substance and name. The Gothic style has faced criticism and praise alike, with some accusing it of lacking depth while others celebrate its ability to evoke the 'terrible sublime,' as noted by Burke. Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" the first \"Gothic Novel,\" fused elements of \"ancient and modern\" romances to pioneer the proto-Gothic genre and develop a new literary form. Walpole incorporated \"old\" theatrical techniques and 'new' naturalistic imitations in 'modern' novels to craft what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre often incorporates elements from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. At the time \"The Castle of Otranto\" was published, \"gothic\" was used to describe a variety of peoples, styles, and epochs, often seen as outdated or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The blend of theatrical \"Gothic\" elements with the novel's format, which provides a more intimate glimpse into character psychology, has allowed the Gothic genre to endure, appearing both outdated and novel to readers far removed in time from its original creation.\n\nA key concept in Gothic novels is Chivalry. The medieval notion of chivalry, the training of a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Chivalry holds special significance for Gothic writers due to its representation of the quintessential knight—brave, honorable, and skilled—and the perceived absence of such ideals in society, particularly noted by Walpole. By incorporating chivalric ideals and behaviors, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, hinting at the Gothic genre's evolution towards Romanticism, and is used as a means to critique and potentially improve the present. While writing \"The Castle of Otranto,\" Walpole was amidst political turmoil and was concerned about the future. Immersed in politics and facing possibly unjust accusations, he might have believed that the morality and inherent \"goodness\" of people from the gothic era had been lost in contemporary society. This idea is evident in his characters, such as Frederic, who is portrayed with many chivalric qualities. Frederic is described as a prince who has endured hardship, been affected by tragedy, and is believed to have been killed by infidels. The depiction of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, introducing the Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the series of processes involved in moving goods from the point of customer order through stages of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution to the customer. This concept was introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who detailed the comprehensive process of planning, executing, and overseeing supply chain activities to meet customer needs effectively and efficiently. The supply chain is composed of six essential components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these components to deliver optimal customer service. \n\nProduction marks the initial phase of the supply chain process, serving as the backbone for the entire series of operations. This stage defines the timing, reasons, locations, and methods for production. Managers must understand customer preferences, which can be discerned by analyzing market trends. The market acts as a primary indicator of customer demand. Once managers understand this demand, they can determine which products to produce and in what quantities. Subsequently, they decide on the optimal production sites and facilities that will meet the required volume and quality, ensuring customer satisfaction. Following the selection of production locations, managers then concentrate on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. Production is a crucial step within the supply chain, and every detail must be meticulously planned to avoid costly errors in time and resources over the long term. For instance, when I worked at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores, both companies had detailed guides and processes for various business aspects, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. Such structured processes enable smooth operations and clarity in roles and expectations.\n\nThe second critical component in supply chain management is supply. Supply involves strategic decision-making to identify the essential capabilities of a facility, and it determines the development of outsourcing partnerships. A single product may have multiple production divisions, each with unique equipment, personnel, and expertise. Managers must evaluate which division best suits different product processes. Additionally, management might opt to outsource certain tasks to other companies. The primary motivation for outsourcing is to enhance velocity, which is the ability to deliver quality and flexibility while simultaneously reducing or maintaining low cost levels.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous detail and focus on the period's aristocracy. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, while considered Victorian, diverge from this tradition. Both novels incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, which are not typical of the era's literature, thereby enhancing the characters and offering deeper insights into their motivations and emotions.\n\n\"Now, a torrent of bewildering and confusing thoughts surged through his mind. He felt as if he was still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were fiercely arguing; their words echoed in his ears, and he realized he was talking to them himself. Suddenly, he jolted at the sound of gunshots; cries and shouts filled the air, lights flashed before his eyes, and noise and chaos surrounded him as an unseen force whisked him away. Amidst these swift visions, he felt a vague, uneasy sense of pain that constantly wearied and tormented him.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nThe two novels frequently use mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, with varying content and purpose in each case. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences often reveal insights into Oliver’s inner self, his suffering, and his awareness of the true nature of his surroundings. When the incident of Oliver being shot is revisited in chapter 28, he re-experiences the event vividly, as if in a dream, while struggling to seek help. This passage highlights Oliver's lack of control over the unfolding events and the precarious state of his health, emphasized by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms his senses; he doesn't notice the \"unseen hand\" that carries him away, reliving the despair detached from the initial shock since the pain has become constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. This overwhelming experience raises questions about who is responsible for his misfortune, as it is certainly not his own doing. The shooting underscores that Oliver has little control over anything, unable to even attempt to influence the outcome of events, even when his life is at stake. This passage implies a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if old Fagin is beginning to break him, pushing him to accept despair and diminishing his ability to react. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least to save his own life.\n\n\"The day passed – day! There was no day; it vanished as soon as it appeared – and night returned; a night so long, yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years back, I was involved in an after-school program where I tutored elementary students. I aimed to assist them in any subject they found challenging, although my expertise lay in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to help a young boy named Adrian, who was in the third or fourth grade and faced significant difficulties with reading. It struck me that there was an unusual issue; while he could pronounce some letters perfectly, others eluded him entirely. Despite his Latino heritage, Adrian spoke flawless English. We encountered several challenges until I met his mother while supervising a few students who didn’t attend a field trip. Adrian's mother spoke only Spanish, and with my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate. That’s when I realized Adrian's issue wasn’t reading itself but his unfamiliarity with the English alphabet. Although I'm unsure if this insight made a difference for him, I hope he is doing better now. \n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issue in schools, particularly in California, and to illustrate that it’s not always as evident as it seems. Even children who speak perfect English can face substantial challenges in reading. While I think everyone acknowledges the existence of this problem, the question remains: how do we address it? For Adrian, the solution was straightforward: English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children who are not fluent in English, the solution is more complicated. There's no single answer. A combination of dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes is essential.\n\nThe dual language system is an excellent concept, not just for Spanish-speaking students but for all children. Studies show that children in two-way bilingual education programs often outperform their peers academically. Despite fears that such programs waste resources and offer no benefit to most students, this is untrue. If these programs were standard rather than exceptions, all students would benefit. But how do we implement this? Requiring all teachers to be bilingual is impractical. Nevertheless, there's no reason we can't employ bilingual aides or tutors.",
            "From a young age, many of us are taught that there exists something greater than ourselves, something beyond our understanding. Some are taken to Sunday school to learn about it, others attend Temple, or look inward for answers. Many people easily embrace the religions passed down by their parents, while others completely reject them, believing there's nothing beyond their personal, self-centered world. We might adopt one belief system only to later change to another. Regardless of the path we take, we embark on a journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique views on spirituality. We seek a guiding light in the darkness to lead us out of the shadows and into the sunshine.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father answered when I asked him about his favorite bird. We sat on our front porch, listening to the rain drumming on the tin roof overhead while we shared cigarettes. The gutters channeled the rain down, overwhelming the plants by the porch. He gazed into the rain with a look that seemed both searching and remembering. Over the past months, he had become thinner, his clothes hanging loosely on his body, and his hair had thinned more than I recalled. He continued to look into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, scared, and unable to express to my father how much I would miss him, because speaking about it would make it all too real for us both. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer to his, and joined him in watching the rain fall on that June evening.\n\nMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation did not ease his suffering but prolonged his life a few months beyond what the doctors had predicted; the value of this extension, given his continued suffering, was unclear to me. I questioned what kind of God would allow this to happen. Alone at night, I offered no prayers. If God existed, I felt he had long stopped listening to me.\n\nI couldn’t bear to watch him transition from this life to the next, so I didn’t. I couldn’t watch the life that brought me into existence come to an end. I wanted to remember my father for how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew him better than anyone else, and I knew he wouldn’t want his only child to witness his death. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate for Republicanism. Although primarily an agriculturist, his profession and brief political career shaped him into a man known for his commitment and outspoken views on personal freedom and governance. His support for an agrarian system underpinned nearly all his governmental opinions. His effort to preserve and promote what he saw as the most noble profession influenced his perspectives on sovereignty, the Constitution, and even the judicial system.\n\nJohn Taylor believed the United States had a unique opportunity to establish an ideal system due to the absence of native traditions that might constrain the government's founders, enabling the creation of a self-governed society. He was a strong believer in the natural rights of individuals, emphasizing that these rights are interconnected, so if one is denied, all are compromised, reducing the value of those remaining. Thus, these rights should remain beyond governmental reach. He argued that what some termed the \"state of nature\" allowed those with physical strength and cunning intelligence to thrive, but in a civilization, this should not be the case.\n\nTo build this ideal society, Taylor believed a government must be established that considers the inherent good and evil within humans. He was firm in his views on dualistic morality, stating that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that protect private property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalism, believing that a government founded on good principles would operate fairly regardless of its leadership, which would inevitably be driven by greed and self-interest. He regarded self-interest as the driving force behind all human actions, considering it only evil when it resulted in societies that thrived at others' expense. A good government was essential to restrain man's natural evil, and even then, it needed close scrutiny to prevent the incorporation of harmful principles.\n\nLike many steadfast Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He desired a very limited Federal government, with no more rights or powers than those explicitly outlined in the Constitution. He recognized that an expansive Federal government would be costly and potentially despotic. However, he believed a simplistic, literal interpretation was dangerous, as it could easily become corrupt without considering the authors' intent. Furthermore, he viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind blankly processing the scene before me. With a detached, silent focus, my awareness observed without connecting the subject to any abstract ideas, analyzing the image in front of my eyes. Thoughts drifted into my mind and disappeared almost as quickly as they arrived. My consciousness functioned so smoothly and effortlessly that it felt as if I had no independent thoughts, just an active, fluid experience of what I was observing. \n\nOnce, following advice from an artist I collaborated with, I bought an art instruction book titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had wanted to learn to draw since I was six years old, and this book covers everything from understanding a pencil to how the brain interprets lines. One technique it teaches is to place a square frame around any image the artist wants to study, transforming a complex scene—like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room—into a simple, focused image of just the bowl of fruit on a plain surface. \n\nAt that moment, as I looked down at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't mentally apply that artist's frame. Overwhelmed and in awe, all I could do was stand and marvel. Picasso had his blue period, Monet adored greenery, and Italian Renaissance masters displayed a spectrum of colors. If I aspired to claim my perspective as Artistic, then before me lay the beginnings of my work, the inception of my story, Work in Brown. \n\nMy fingertips touched my chosen tool of artistry, muscles tensing and relaxing as my hand moved through space, my mind's intent taking shape in what could have been my most creative moment. Water swirled, serene and clear. Flakes of matter separated from the whole, carried away to oblivion. Muscles tightened and spasmed more anxiously on the second attempt as my hand struck the toilet handle again. The stubborn brown mass remained immobile, clinging to the toilet bottom like a slug.\n\nWith a mop held loosely in my hand, feet spaced a foot apart, and a green tie uncomfortably knotted around my neck, I frowned at the offensive bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the unlucky cleaners at Rite Aid. After a few more flushes and some tranquil, introspective moments, my hand reached for the toilet paper, wrapped it around itself until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing upright, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the toilet, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "Teenagers are losing their lives in car accidents, and several factors contribute to this alarming trend among the youngest drivers in America. According to the National Institutes of Health, one part of the issue is that the teen brain is not yet equipped to handle the dangers of driving. Additionally, lack of experience is a significant factor, leading not only to more fatal crashes but also to an increased rate of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and off-road incidents.  \nTeenagers also tend to have worse outcomes when they are driving with their peers—a common occurrence. Research from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has demonstrated a link between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents.  \nIn an effort to improve teen driver safety, California and other states have implemented temporary provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit other minors from being passengers.  \nHowever, I believe provisional licenses are merely temporary fixes. The core issue is that, as a group, the youngest drivers are statistically unable to manage the risks and responsibilities effectively. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman even suggests that 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license. His research, reported by USA Today, indicates a prevalent desire among those under 19-20 to engage in risk-taking for the thrill. Therefore, delaying driving until this thrill-seeking tendency diminishes seems logical. Continuing to grant licenses to young teens will likely result in ongoing fatal accidents, with the death toll expected to rise significantly in the coming years. By 2010, the children of Baby Boomers will be eligible to drive, adding millions of new teenage drivers to the roads.  \nAddressing this issue through legislation would be relatively straightforward. Schools could maintain driver’s education classes to start the learning process, but no one under 18 would be allowed to drive. A provisional permit could be issued before a full license, and a certain number of training hours would still be required. This number could be based on current state requirements (for instance, California mandates 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of adult-supervised practice). Since the concerning statistics for teen drivers emerge nationwide, a uniform, national law would be a sensible and effective way to protect teens across the country.  \nThe legislation I propose is not a new concept.",
            "This paper explores three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with a concise definition of the disorder, followed by an explanation of its diagnosis, highlighting common traits or \"red flags.\" The paper concludes with strategies for teachers in mainstream classrooms to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), pertains to how efficiently and effectively the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. Specifically, it involves the perceptual processing of sound information in the CNS and the neurobiological activity that supports this processing, leading to electrophysiological auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it is a disorder where the brain struggles to process auditory input accurately. Individuals with CAPD have normal hearing and are not considered \"hearing impaired\"; rather, the brain region responsible for interpreting sounds, such as distinguishing words or separating conversation from background noise, does not function as it typically should.\n\nThe earliest reference to what is now known as CAPD dates back to the mid-1950s, when it was referred to as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Researchers were studying children with communication disorders at that time. In 1954, the Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children, and by 1961, Kimura had introduced dichotic testing and developed a model to explain the physiology of the central auditory nervous system involved in dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 spurred further research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD can present in various ways: individuals may struggle to localize or hear sounds in space, have difficulty distinguishing between different \"acoustic events\" (sound occurrences), fail to recognize sound patterns, or be unable to detect changes in speech, such as sarcasm indicated by tone shifts. Subsequent sounds might block earlier ones, they might lack the ability to synthesize auditory clues into meaningful information to act upon, and they may struggle to identify the sequence of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, patients undergo \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,\" which may be administered by \"audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using various measures that evaluate auditory-related skills\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This process may involve questionnaires, surveys, and observation of how patients respond to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single tool or test consistently used with a high success rate for diagnosis, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Many tests involve presenting the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and asking them to differentiate certain elements, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to these signals.",
            "In choosing to study social work, my goal is to build a career with the Division of Family and Children Services to assist children who have suffered abuse or neglect, and to support families facing difficulties. The values I bring to the field of social work include service, respect, ethical behavior, a commitment to enhancing relationships among people, and a dedication to my own professional development to remain effective in my role. These values are not only essential for social workers but are also personally significant to me.\n\nI have always wanted to help others, though I was initially unsure of the exact career I wanted to pursue. During high school and college, I observed many people avoiding their problems or using less than ideal coping strategies. These experiences led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, still uncertain about my career path, I decided to take a break. One summer day, a friend introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy in her home, who was there to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he had contacted the police about his situation. I went to his parents' home to see if I could assist. I privately shared my concerns with the police, mentioning my recent Psychology degree. They asked me to speak with the parents, as the law offered no immediate solution for the teenager. In conversation, the parents appeared uneasy and made excuses about their son's \"manipulative\" behavior in seeking outside help for \"simple\" family disputes. This experience prompted me to seriously consider a career in social work to aid children facing family conflicts.\n\nAnother critical value in social work is social justice. As a society, we claim to value individuals and mourn those we lose. However, the societal concept of an \"individual\" often aligns more with old traditions than true uniqueness. If society truly values individuals, why do we strive to conform? I consider myself an individual and resist limiting myself to fit in with others. Throughout high school and college, I protested social injustice by expressing myself through unconventional hair colors, wearing clothes that reflected my personality, getting additional ear piercings, participating in GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and opposing racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. I am committed to social justice and will continue to stand against social injustices.",
            "This paper examines the Biological and Sociocultural models as they relate to insomnia. The Biological model emphasizes inherited genetic factors and medical health aspects, while the Sociocultural model considers environmental interactions and their relevance to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The review of insomnia explores these models and details each selected piece of research to better elucidate the models. The research and its conclusions are then critiqued to highlight their particular strengths and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary sleep disorders, those related to another mental disorder, or those linked to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, whereas those related to another mental disorder are associated with an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other sleep disorder categories may arise from medical issues or substance use. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves problems with obtaining or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia pertains to difficulties staying awake, both persisting for at least a month. Narcolepsy is characterized by cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. Dyssomnias focus on the initiation and maintenance of sleep, whereas Parasomnias relate to sleep disorders with behavioral or physiological anomalies. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders linked to another mental disorder involve sleep challenges due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily considers insomnia and, to some extent, primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders centers on genetic, heritable, and physiologically acquired aspects. Hypothalamic neurons containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. Research on mice demonstrated that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons play a crucial role in sleep/wake states. Activating the GABAA receptor induces sleep-promoting responses, and inhibiting its firing can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) was shown to increase sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that mouse models may be applicable to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or deficiency with this receptor might impair one's ability to achieve sufficient sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if this phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and any alteration to the receptor might naturally disrupt sleep, adversely affecting aspects of life such as education, career, and routine tasks requiring sustained attention.",
            "I have been studying here at University Park for nearly two and a half years, which amounts to four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many, myself included. During my freshman year, I lived in a dorm room in East Halls, which is about as far east as you can get on campus, aside from the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my dorm in Stuart Hall to classes in distant buildings like Willard, which is near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes, particularly in the often inclement weather of State College. An alum I spoke with, who isn't much older than me, mentioned that not long ago, East Halls used to be separated from the main campus by large areas of undeveloped land. Now, those areas have been developed with sports fields, large new buildings like the Creamery and a new health services building, and are surrounded by apartments. As the campus continues to grow, getting around becomes increasingly difficult. The best solution for improving mobility on a college campus is the bicycle. However, simply having bikes isn't enough; students need to use them, and the campus must be designed to accommodate cyclists.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who has started biking again after several years, and he expressed surprise at why he ever stopped. “Bikes are fantastic,” he said, “for a while it wasn’t trendy to ride a bike, but it’s the most practical way to get around.” Besides being beneficial for health, biking is the most efficient mode of transportation. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical effort can take you over 30 miles. Like many other students, I now live off-campus, just as far from the campus center as some dorms. Buying a bike has been my best decision this year. I have classes in the Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. Biking can reduce that time to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. The only issue is that Pollock Road, the most direct route to the Thomas building from my home, isn’t always easy to navigate, whether you're biking or not. Walking has its merits too, but I’m too busy to walk everywhere. Without my bike, walking would be my sole reliable means of getting to class. Walking to Thomas daily would consume an extra 30-40 minutes of my time each day, totaling over two and a half hours weekly. Adding the time spent walking to other classes, appointments, and more, it’s more time than I can afford to lose.",
            "In \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley critiques the looming dangers posed by technology and the capitalist framework that supports it, by depicting a dystopian society. The inhabitants of this society prioritize community over individuality and are conditioned from birth to seek immediate gratification above everything else. These citizens are mere pawns in a vast scheme, bound to a single ideology as dictated by the World Controller. Analyzing the novel through a Marxist lens reveals Huxley's skepticism about the evolution of these systems. Marxist concepts such as homogeny and reification underscore the idea that Huxley's work comments on the pitfalls of the burgeoning economy of his era.\n\nCapitalism is satirized using the Marxist concept of false consciousness, which asserts that ordinary citizens are kept ignorant of their true economic relationships with other classes, as they focus primarily on personal gain. This is said to result from the ideological control of the proletariat and common workers, a point that is evident in the conditioning seen in \"Brave New World.\" The lower classes, like the Deltas and Gammas, lack genuine free will; their desire to consume and indulge is amplified through hypnopaedia, as orchestrated by the World Controller. Hegemony, where social classes are entirely dominated by a distinct group of individuals, is clearly at play. The lower classes are unaware of their manipulation, literally buying into an ideology that supports capitalism and consumerism. Though the upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, have the potential to recognize this manipulation, few, apart from characters like Bernard, challenge their roles. The interactions among social classes highlight the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" genuine relationships among different individuals are nonexistent. The novel seems to avoid giving depth to its characters, even among the main ones, possibly suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism strips humanity of free will and expression. Love and strong emotions are absent, with interactions remaining shallow. This is depicted through men's comments on women's physical traits and women's candid remarks about their experiences. Moreover, the complacency of each societal class with their place in the hierarchy reflects the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their complete adherence to their roles in the community is indicative of Marxist views on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their superiority as long as they continue to consume and conform.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I attended a course on Islam at CBC. A major topic of debate in the class was whether Islam is an aggressive religion. I believe this issue is even more pertinent now than ever. Reflecting on events since 9/11, I've noticed the mass media shift from a hostile perspective on Islam and extremists to an extreme tolerance for Islam in America. In 2001, it would have seemed unlikely for someone with the name Borac Obama, who has evident Muslim roots in his family, to run for president.\n\nThe Prophet's biography fascinates me because, based on my understanding of Muhammad's history, it seems to contradict his personality. From what I've learned, I assumed Muhammad converted people to Islam by force, conquering tribes and compelling them to adopt Islam. However, the biography portrays Muhammad as a misunderstood martyr who humbled himself before others, eventually attracting followers who recognized the 'truth' in his teachings.\n\nAdditionally, there are striking similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' attributed to Muhammad. Notably, he is said to have multiplied mutton and milk to feed more than forty men. This narrative style suggests the authors intended to depict Muhammad as a humble prophet who simply lived in truth and performed miracles, without needing to prove anything. I find this problematic because it undermines the miracles and life of Jesus Christ, as if credit for Jesus' life is being claimed through Muhammad.\n\nThe biography also contains numerous stories that seem to aim at providing evidence of 'witness' or people converting to Islam 'on their own.' However, many stories are from third-party perspectives, where the author recounts hearing from someone who heard from someone else, and so on. I disliked this approach because, although intended to validate the stories, it made them seem less credible and more dubious.\n\nWhat disturbs me most about the work is its attempts to glorify Muhammad as a godly figure who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. Yet, historical accounts contradict the portrayal of Muhammad as gentle and humble, and I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus during his lifetime were quickly left behind as Christian thought evolved after his death. Observing this historical trajectory broadly, we notice Christianity drifting further from its roots. In today's world, there is a growing awareness and a remarkable progressive trend. While some traditionalists persist and resist thinking beyond their learned teachings, they may not be influential enough to sway the majority. Among Christians, historical understanding will significantly increase in future years. There will be a widespread desire to separate doctrines that were later added to Christianity from the original intentions of its founder. This process may take decades or even centuries, but it seems inevitable: a major shift in Christian history will occur. Christianity will gradually return to its original form, shedding layers of doctrine over time, as though turning back the clock, until only Jesus' initial message from God remains, before other thinkers added their ideas. As this trend spreads across the United States and Europe, leading many to worship as though in Jesus' time, focusing solely on his teachings, the church will remain strong to guide the way. However, because the theological clock will have been reset, the current diversity in Christianity will give way to more uniform beliefs and practices. Across regions and denominations, we will see increasing similarities rather than differences. History is filled with significant reversions. For instance, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, which later embraced Christianity. Similarly, our country has transitioned from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The upcoming significant reversion will occur within Christianity, reversing history to find its original source, and diminishing diversity in the process. This transformation will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus’ words metaphorically rather than literally. So what has happened since Jesus' lifetime? Tracing back in history, we find Judaism, the theological foundation of Christianity. By the time Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the revelation of divine religion, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures were central to the faith. The Jewish people were not unified, dividing into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of ordinary people.",
            "In my view, The Jungle illustrates the inherent greed and self-interest in human nature. People primarily focus on their own well-being and improving their lives, often ignoring those beneath them. This theme is evident throughout the novel, particularly in the actions of the factory owners and managers. Their sole aim is to expand and enhance their businesses, showing no concern for those affected by their pursuits. Upton Sinclair's narrative highlights this through vivid imagery: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair illustrates the environmental and social damage caused by pollution, showing the owners' disregard for the harm to people and animals. They are indifferent to the smoke and waste pollution from the factories and surrounding animal pens. \n\nMoreover, the owners and managers have little regard for the workers who enrich them. They exploit their workforce to maximize profits, creating an environment rife with jealousy and animosity, devoid of loyalty or decency. Employees are subjected to grueling hours and can be laid off en masse without notice, compensation, or assistance in finding new employment. During the period depicted in The Jungle, labor laws and worker protections were virtually non-existent, allowing employers to impose harsh conditions and demand faster work. Although the book doesn't explicitly state it, workers living and laboring in Packingtown were expected to endure the appalling conditions at work and in their communities. There were no agencies to support or inform workers, and while unions existed, they often exploited workers further. The employees were so poorly treated and trapped in the system that they resembled slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is one of Edgar Allan Poe's poems that he regarded highly. In this poem, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott links to Virgil. Virgil mentioned this term referring to an island north of Britain, considered by the Greeks as the boundary of the known world. While Virgil indeed used the term, there's a more contemporary influence worth noting. Poe had a keen interest in German authors. This interest is significant as it highlights Poe’s familiarity with Goethe’s work. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" notes the similarity between their poems, suggesting Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned author of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. In the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells of a king whose wife dies after gifting him a goblet. Grieving, the king drinks heavily and mourns his lost queen. Eventually, he decides to die, giving his possessions to his children except for the goblet. He walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and dies. The king’s demeanor and his portrayal in \"Dream-Land\" share similarities, perhaps reflecting Poe's own struggles with loss and drinking. \"Faust\" was also adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, shortly before Poe used the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" \n\nPoe mentions Thule twice in his collected works. He refers to \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and uses it twice as a framing device in \"Dream-Land.\" \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as complementary. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes Thule as dark and lonely, haunted by deceased friends, and perceives a colorless, shadowy world. These themes echo Goethe's \"The King of Thulé,\" where the king mourns his wife, feels isolated, and loses his will to rule or live. The poem feels as though the speaker walks into Goethe’s work. \n\nGoethe was a prominent author whom Poe would have known, not only due to his admiration for Tennyson. Poe expressed his respect for Tennyson, and this connection, along with the many reproductions of Goethe’s work after its initial publication, would have exposed Poe to Goethe’s influence.",
            "Under California law, can a customer who was injured after slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store receive punitive damages if it can be shown that the store manager acted with malice? This might be argued if the manager was informed twice about the spill but delayed cleaning it for half an hour due to having dinner. A judge is unlikely to immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive damages. To justify such a claim, the plaintiff needs to provide evidence that the defendant acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm their actions could cause, as well as prove that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have known about the potential harm of leaving a spill unattended, especially since there had been several slip-and-fall incidents at D&D in the months before her accident. Despite this, Martin did not address the spill. Although Palmer’s argument that Martin’s behavior was despicable is less convincing, it remains reasonable given that six similar incidents occurred in 2009 and Martin still did not take necessary safety measures.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin, on his dinner break, said he didn’t have time for customer complaints. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin of the spill, and his response was the same. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill and suffered a serious back injury. Before Palmer’s accident, five slip-and-fall incidents were reported at D&D in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages due to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can obtain punitive damages for breaching a non-contractual obligation if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice,\" according to Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or if not intended, the conduct must be \"despicable\" and done with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Courts have deemed conduct malicious when done with a conscious disregard for the plaintiff’s rights, especially when the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences and willfully failed to prevent them, as noted in Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "She always felt an unfulfilled longing, a need that started around the age of 14 as she entered her teenage years. Even at 17, she still experienced this yearning, realizing it was for someone rather than something. Despite this realization, she found herself uninterested in boys. Though some had tried, often awkwardly, to win her over, none captured her interest. She frequently pondered why she felt this way, considering various theories over the years but never finding a satisfactory explanation. She continued to live her life, persistently questioning her desires.\n\nMost days at home were peaceful, as her parents were calm, never quarreling with each other and rarely with her. The only disagreements arose from her expression of independence and free spirit. Despite having calm parents, she balanced their tranquility with her vibrant and fun personality, making her both likable and genuinely nice.\n\nHowever, today was different. As she moved through the house, seeking inspiration, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, her mother's beautiful voice. Rushing in, panic set in as she frantically asked, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mother lay on the floor, clearly in pain, repeatedly murmuring \"Ow\" in short breaths. Quickly, she knelt beside her mother to help. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital,\" her mother gasped. Her daughter recognized the urgency in her voice. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Following her mother's directions, she felt thankful for the strength she gained from her classes. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the back, and drove to the hospital.\n\nArriving at the hospital, she was too focused on her mother to notice the usual scents of disinfectant and fear. She swiftly carried her injured mother inside, urgently calling for medical assistance. Several concerned staff members gathered, quickly placing her mother on a rolling bed and taking her for immediate care, leaving her daughter to wait anxiously.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a step stool while trying to retrieve a vase from the highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a Mediterranean Diet, indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and mortality due to stroke. The aMed diet is a variation of the Mediterranean Diet, emphasizing increased consumption of plant-based foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (as opposed to saturated fats), and fish, while minimizing intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown a negative correlation between adherence to a Mediterranean Diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular mortality, with an intervention trial revealing that the Mediterranean Diet is more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in obese individuals. However, prior studies did not specifically address stroke or stroke-related mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who had no history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes and were part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. The authors calculated an aMed diet score six times between 1984 and 2004 using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) to evaluate nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of participants remained in the study for the entire 20-year period. The FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were corroborated through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. In cases lacking records, incidents were deemed \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions classified this way. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, and leisure-time physical activity was recorded starting in 1986.\n\nTo minimize random individual variation and better reflect long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated by averaging scores from two previous years. Adjustments were made for confounding factors, including age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe study used Cox proportional-hazard modeling to evaluate the relationship between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, reflected in a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a reduced risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, there were 2,391 new cases of CHD, 1,763 new cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combining fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.71.",
            "The sign reads, \"Hitler is alive in Burma,\" held by Ellen Page, the leading actress from Juno, as she stands alone on a street corner with the message scrawled in Sharpie on a piece of cardboard. Burma, or Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a repressive military junta that seized power through a coup in 1962. In 2007, Burma witnessed its first public demonstrations in a decade, known as \"The Saffron Revolution,\" led predominantly by Burmese monks, named after the color of their robes. Initially, the Burmese government reluctantly permitted the monks to gather peacefully, but the situation soon escalated into a violent confrontation between the monks and the military, with the military raiding monasteries nationwide. Foreign journalists were detained and jailed, and Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai was killed on September 27, 2007, during a street protest. The official death toll is recorded at 13, but Colonel Hla Win, an army defector, claimed, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThese occurrences are not new. Governments have long sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over their citizens. Roman emperors declared themselves divine rulers with total authority over their societies. Japanese emperors are considered deities, believed to lead their people to prosperity. Meanwhile, President George W. Bush reportedly has regular conference calls with Ted Haggard, head of Stupid People Worldwide, a group associated with the Republican Party.\n\nHistorically, notable examples of such actions include the Tiananmen Square protests on June 4, 1989, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students protested against the government’s authoritarian rule. The death toll from this event varies widely, with Chinese government reports claiming 200-300 deaths, while the Chinese Red Cross reported between 2,000 and 3,000 deaths. Another instance is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias, supported by the Rwandan government, systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates. Additionally, Hitler’s 'Third Reich' represents a period marked by the genocide of Jews across several years and countries.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting influence in jazz largely stems from his long career and his creative ability to shape his orchestra. While his piano presence is often understated in many of the works chosen for this assignment, as a composer, Ellington excelled in crafting intricate pieces that highlighted the unique talents of his band members. He designed frameworks that allowed soloists to improvise freely and composed tightly orchestrated sections that emphasized the distinctive styles of his musicians to bring out musical concepts. This approach also underscored the overall tone of the orchestra, creating cohesive and original sounds tailored to each composition. Ellington's skill in understanding both the individual sound of his players and how they blended in a growing ensemble enabled him to create some of the most innovative and remarkable works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, when discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, refers to \"Creole Love Call\" as an early example of his use of voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This piece illustrates Ellington's ability to add texture and color without relying on lyrics and showcases his talent for complementing his soloists' styles, evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues composition consists of six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Features a call and response between voice and reeds, starting with a smooth melodic voice that turns rougher towards the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo elaborates on the melody, highlighting several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register is supported by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band mirrors the first chorus with a call and response between brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus has the reeds initiating the call and response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: Returns to the structure of the first chorus, with a call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice uses the \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Concludes with a brief vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to enhance tone color in this piece exemplifies a stylistic trait that is pervasive in his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington combines tight orchestration with an ear for tone color. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing integrates the vocal qualities of Miley’s playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice, creating a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" builds on these ideas, as Ellington effectively utilizes Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a staple in his orchestra, to introduce the melody with a muted trombone.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the ways they do? Are there specific limitations or constraints that shape the course of evolutionary change? Although D’Arcy Thompson in 1917 remarked that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" this observation remains relevant today. More recently, mathematical modeling has been employed to explore general aspects of mollusk shell formation, both in the context of individual development and evolutionary history (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of changes during development and evolution in Prunum, coupled with experimental studies, can clarify the mechanisms that determine the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental change. We utilized X-ray images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that can be used to model both theoretical and actual shell shapes. These parameters were inputted into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We created models of theoretical shell shapes to explore the limits of possible morphological changes in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive research to gain a deeper understanding of major evolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be considered as a structure that forms a tube, revolving over time through 360 degrees of space. These revolutions, or turns of a coiled shell, are called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis. This axis runs through the shell's central column, known as the columella. The rate at which the whorls expand can differ, and a continuous line, called a suture, separates each whorl. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last one, known as the body whorl. The spire includes all whorls except the last. The spire's tip is the apex, while the opposite end is the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upward.)\n\nA method for counting whorls is described below. First, view the shell from the apical perspective and identify where the first suture begins. A line can then be drawn, dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line and estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a sequence of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. It is possible to trace the aperture's path using the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture, as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical formulation is established, it becomes possible to alter parameters and modify the mollusk's shell formation.",
            "For the past decade, Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have shown little change. Although the nation is progressing towards achieving many Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, the advancements in child and maternal health fall significantly short of the targets set for 2015. The underlying causes of these deficiencies, which will be elaborated upon below, indicate a necessity to enhance the health system instead of solely concentrating on specific program interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in the number of births attended by skilled health workers, reaching 72%. However, this statistic still includes traditional workers, like midwives, who cannot perform medical procedures in complicated pregnancies, contributing to the high rate of maternal deaths from hemorrhage. Thus, the progress in this area is somewhat deceptive, and substantial improvements are still required. Moreover, there has been a reduction in the percentage of children under five with diarrhea being treated by healthcare professionals. Although data on postnatal care is not comprehensive, it is evident that this is another area of concern, with low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain lower than expected, around 4%. These rates highlight another issue: the disparity in healthcare access. While urban areas have a c-section rate of 7%, rural areas only have a rate of 2%, illustrating the inequitable distribution of healthcare services. Additionally, there is a 27% gap in healthcare service usage between the poorest and richest segments of the population, indicating that the poor face significant barriers to accessing healthcare, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn considering steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, a fundamental question arises: how can the service gap be most effectively addressed? Should Indonesia focus on specific program interventions or strengthen the entire health system without concentrating exclusively on pre and postnatal care? While program-specific solutions offer clear, manageable goals and typically yield quicker results, they also have downsides. One major issue is that heavy investment in a particular health sector area can divert funds from other areas, drawing human resources towards the better-funded sector, as seen with international funding for HIV/AIDS impacting the family planning sector. Furthermore, running multiple concurrent programs for one area can lead to service duplication and lack of coordination, resulting in increased paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "The classification of popular music has expanded significantly over the last century, now encompassing so many genres that it's challenging to list them all comprehensively. Adding to this complexity, nearly every genre—like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—has generated numerous sub-genres and even more specific sub-sub-genres. Among these, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has arguably become one of the most varied and expressive forms of popular music over the past 40 years. It is considered expressive because it covers a broad spectrum of emotions, albeit generally on the darker side. Its diversity stems from the early realization of its inherent flexibility, which musicians quickly leveraged to create their own sub-genres, leading to further sub-sub-genres, a trend that continues today.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal scene has evolved to such an extent that the sheer number of niche groups makes it challenging to define what heavy metal truly is. It has absorbed a wide array of themes from other genres, yet it originated from a specific point. To properly comprehend the metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp what the metal movement represents and why it is considered a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nIn many respects, metal is a movement characterized by darkness. It can be described as \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatricality. It moves away from primitivism towards technical skill; members of metal bands are adept musicians, which is evident in their music. Additionally, metal is a movement significantly influenced by drugs, particularly following the psychedelic drug surge of the mid-70s, which led people to create extraordinary, otherworldly records, using drugs as inspiration. Metal's dark, visceral qualities were a novel addition to the music scene, contrasting with the lighter themes in much of popular music. Moreover, later generations of metal drew inspiration from the dark, visceral elements prevalent in the Romantic Era. Lyrics from songs like \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles highlight the darkness integral to this movement.\n\nThese lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" showcase the Beatles' darker side, reflecting the highs and lows associated with drugs. Some consider it among the first Heavy Metal songs, created in response to a similarly heavy and dark Rolling Stones song. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate that they could be as intense as the Stones, thus including the track on \"The White Album.\"",
            "Several decades prior to the emergence of Surrealist artists with their dream-inspired creations, Henri Rousseau was meticulously forming his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only portrays a woman marveling at the extraordinary landscape she encounters in a dream, but it also symbolizes Rousseau’s personal aspirations and ambitions as an artist. From the onset of his career, Rousseau yearned for recognition, acceptance, and acclaim from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet he faced a challenging internal conflict in pursuit of this goal. The Dream encapsulates Rousseau's persistent internal struggle throughout his career: whether to adhere to or imitate certain artistic styles to gain acceptance in the esteemed art world he greatly admired, or to embrace his creative independence and distinctiveness, forging his own path as he progressed.\n\nBefore delving into an analysis of The Dream through this lens, it is essential to be acquainted with Rousseau’s background. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who \"enjoyed bourgeois prosperity\" (Shattuck 47). He lacked formal artistic education and worked for the municipal toll service in France until the age of forty, although he was erroneously nicknamed a customs inspector, or douanier (Shattuck 46). The loss of his first wife, Clémence, after the deaths of their eight infant children, left Rousseau with a daughter named Julia and profound sorrow (Shattuck 49). Seeking solace and a fresh start, he turned to painting as a refuge. Unlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized peasants in their art, Rousseau was fundamentally a folk painter who embodied the aspirations and dreams of an average person from his social background.\n\nRousseau’s intense desire for acceptance in the art world is somewhat understandable in context: as noted, he was self-taught in formal painting techniques and commenced his artistic career later in life, while competing with numerous other skilled and more renowned modern artists. Despite years of work, it was not until the same period that Matisse began establishing his reputation as an artist that Rousseau started to gain proper recognition for his art. In the book Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes that although Rousseau and Matisse were rivals in the art scene, they differed not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations for painting: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).",
            "Many prominent thinkers have suggested a deep relationship between ethics and aesthetics, as well as truth and beauty. I believe there is a fundamental reason for this connection. As John Keats expresses in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we understand in life comes through education or experience. Yet, as Keats implies, we seem to grasp ethics and aesthetics naturally, without the need for formal teaching. Both fields strive to describe rather than dictate. Our exploration of morality and beauty largely involves explaining why a work of art or literature is beautiful or why an action is moral, rather than offering a set of rules for evaluating or creating good art or ethical behavior.\n\nFurthermore, critiques of art or morals never fully capture the essence of what is good or beautiful. For instance, discussions about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on aspects like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural significance, but these do not truly explain why it is considered great art. When asked about a favorite piece of art or literature, people often say, \"There's just something about it,\" before providing a more detailed or analytical explanation. I believe that both art and morals cannot be entirely reduced to descriptions of their attributes. As Flannery O'Connor states, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe the features of a literary work, there remains a transcendent quality. I think ethics shares this same characteristic. Wittgenstein noted, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that this \"something,\" this indescribable essence, is the most compelling aspect of art and morality, and that the transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics connects them.\n\nI believe morality and art are closely linked because we experience both most profoundly at a noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. They affect us in a way that can be felt but not fully explained. This connection is even more pronounced in the art of literature. As McKean observes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Modern Germany is seen as a powerful and unified nation, showcasing a unique cultural blend stretching from the Alps' shadows in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This culture is evident from Cologne on the Rhine, through central Germany, to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given this distinct culture, it's unsurprising that contemporary Germany has diverse origins and tribal influences.\n\nThe ancestral land of the Germans, known as Germania, has a name whose origins are debated among scholars and historians. Tacitus suggested that the name derived from a Germanic Tribe once called Tungrians, who were initially known as Germans before crossing the Rhine and clashing with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first introduced the term “Germanus” in his writings on the Gallic Wars, where he defeated the Gauls and fought Germanic tribes often crossing the Rhine with questionable intentions. He borrowed this term from the Gauls to distinguish between the conquered Gauls and the unconquered. Though the origin is unclear, some think it referred to a neighboring tribe in the Gaulish language. In the opening chapter of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar mentions: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC). Others suggest the meaning comes from the spear used in warfare, called a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout,” reflecting the Germans' loud nature (Names of Germany).\n\nIn AD 98, the Roman historian Tacitus, in his work “De Origine et situ Germanorum,” wrote about the Germans' origins, stating, “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98).\n\nAnd who would abandon Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, at least not yet. They would venture into Germania for goods and occasionally launch land campaigns but generally returned to their vast empire. As the Germanic tribes began to emerge in the middle of the first century, they settled on the Roman Empire's borders, trading goods from the land and serving in the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" suggests that while disguises can effectively sustain prolonged deception, ultimately, a person must abandon their assumed identity to avoid becoming lost in it indefinitely. The challenge in ending a deception lies in the potential for alienation. Thus, one must choose between preserving their own identity or maintaining their relationships with others. Some may react indifferently to discovering they have been deceived, but others might be offended by the entire ruse.\n\nThe theme of deception through gender role reversal is particularly complex, raising questions about the reasons behind adopting such a disguise. Why would someone feel the need to conceal their true identity by posing as the opposite gender? In Viola's situation, it is a means of self-protection: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). \n\nNewly arrived in a foreign land, Viola sees the need to masquerade as a man to safeguard herself from potential threats. While her strategy succeeds, it also isolates her from other women, depriving her of crucial support. Complicating matters, she is so convincing as a man that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Furthermore, Viola must contend with unspoken romantic feelings between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261).\n\nTo a modern audience, \"Twelfth Night\" might illustrate how deception can reveal hidden emotions, particularly for Olivia and Orsino. Some scenes imply that these characters may have unacknowledged desires that Viola/Cesario's presence compels them to confront. For example, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because she perceives him as a man, or does she secretly have feelings for women? One could argue this is unlikely, as Shakespeare's Olivia seems to parody those who judge others based solely on appearance. This is demonstrated by how easily Olivia shifts her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, ultimately viewing Cesario/Viola as family rather than a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German colonial rule is often characterized by its harshness, particularly with regard to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in what was then German South West Africa. However, it is too simplistic to describe an entire colonial empire with such a broad stroke. The German colonial empire exhibited a wide range of policies and governance styles across its diverse territories. Similarly, educational systems varied throughout the colonies. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a significant number of educated and literate Africans. German efforts in education in Kamerun and other colonies were commended by contemporaries. \n\nIn stark contrast, the situation in South West Africa (now Namibia) was different. Unlike East Africa, where the government was actively involved in establishing state schools and educating the local population, in South West Africa, the responsibility for native education was largely handed over to missionary societies with minimal government assistance. The government, however, concentrated resources on European education within the colony, setting up state schools and providing greater support and oversight for missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, even beyond German rule. While other German colonies had notable numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, the vast majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate. Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to the unique situation in South West Africa. This paper aims to deepen the discussion by identifying these factors, focusing on new research regarding the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is extensive literature specifically concerning education within the German colonial empire. Most of these works, written in German in the early twentieth century, were produced during or shortly after the German colonial period and primarily aimed to describe educational systems in these colonies. Later English-language studies broadened the discourse through comparative analyses of education in different German colonies and in-depth examinations of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant disparities among the educational systems in various colonies. Cohen's study, which directly addresses the topic of this paper, is notable for comparing the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa and discussing the factors responsible for their differences. Cohen points out that the large settler population in South West Africa accounts for many distinctive features of its educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany’s other colonies, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of it was arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans resided in South West Africa, compared to just 5,336 in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The United States and Mexico serve as an example of two countries once engulfed in a prolonged rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The pinnacle of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, acquiring Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Numerous other conflicts occurred between these nations, eventually diminishing just before World War I. The rivalry originated from clashes between Americans and Mexicans over significant issues such as religion, culture, traditions, and diverging material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31). \n\nThis situation is similar to many other countries experiencing enduring rivalries with neighboring nations. Countries that share borders often face conflicting interests, leading to rivalries. The United States and Mexico exemplify many longstanding rivalries between neighboring countries. David M. Pletcher (1977) mentions that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41). Indeed, both these nations are geographically close to the United States and have historically been rivals, while other Latin American countries have generally maintained positive relations with the United States.\n\nReligious differences caused a divide between the two nations, a challenge that has troubled many countries throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that “if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy” (p. 86). Unlike the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was partly ideological and partly about competing interests each nation considered essential, this conflict was rooted in religious preferences rather than political structures. This mistrust evolved from the historical animosity between the English and Spanish. Inheriting this distrust from their colonial predecessors posed a significant barrier to establishing friendly diplomatic relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identify 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry. Most of these disputes involved territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier challenges. Raids by bandits and outlaws on American border towns were a persistent issue until both the United States and Mexico enforced military control over their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). Schmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry between the two nations began to subside as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and eventually concluded when American ambitions shifted “from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p. 110) in the latter part of the 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly rendered disabled by an illness I never knew existed.\n\nAt that time, I worked as a nurse, a profession I chose because I craved the safety and security I lacked during my childhood. \"You'll always have work; people will always get sick,\" was the mantra that echoed through my adolescence and beyond. Although my dream was to become a scientist or journalist—or a mix of both—I opted for nursing.\n\nYet, there I was, 46 years old, single, with no significant savings, and unable to work. Even now, I am disabled, and after 15 years of relying on Social Security Disability, I have virtually nothing that is truly \"mine.\" I manage to get by, but each day is a struggle that threatens my sense of security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, except for one truth: I couldn't have survived all these years without the support of my family and a few good friends, no matter how resilient I was. When real disaster strikes, you don't feel very strong at all.\n\nMy point is that life will always present emergencies—both big and small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how diligently one prepares, some challenges are simply too overwhelming to tackle alone.\n\nI completely agree that in the U.S., we must stop relying solely on the government, whose system is clearly deteriorating. However, I would much prefer to see Americans regain trust in one another—learning to offer and request help—rather than each of us independently constructing fallout shelters in our backyards.\n\nConservatives in the U.S. often speak of the \"rugged individualism\" that built this nation, but in reality, what sustained our forefathers during tough times was not rugged individualism, but rather compassion, mutual respect, and resource sharing. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn’t succeed by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, plus plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in case of a biological attack. I own several flashlights, various batteries, plenty of candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and can preserve your own food, do it. It’s a great idea, as is a wood stove, provided you don’t live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he gave up worldly possessions and attained enlightenment, leading to the founding of Buddhism. The most traditional branch of this religion is Theravada Buddhism. Now approximately 2,500 years old, Buddhism today differs from its original form during Buddha's time. This evolution is evident, for example, in Sri Lanka, a Theravada Buddhist country, where the annual water-cutting ceremony takes place. Both monks and laypeople take part in this event, which holds religious importance, even though Buddha never mentioned such celebrations. These changes range from surface-level traditions to the fundamental beliefs of the religion. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community, both monks and lay followers, has had to adapt its doctrines, influenced by various external and internal, hostile and benign forces.\n\nSeveral key terms will be frequently used in this discussion. \"Internal\" refers to influences originating from members of the Buddhist community, regardless of their monastic status, while \"external\" pertains to influences from non-Buddhists. A \"hostile\" force is one that harms or intends to harm the Buddhist community, stemming from a negative view of Buddhism. A \"benign\" force neither aims to harm nor help, though it may inadvertently do so. These terms will be repeatedly referenced throughout the discussion.\n\nTo begin, it's crucial to explore the fundamental doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the \"triple gem\" of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma primarily consists of the Tripitaka, or the \"three baskets\" of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka includes the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Recognizing these concepts is essential to ending Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. With the end of Sansara, one also eliminates lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) upon reaching enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka provides rules for living. Laypeople adhere to five precepts: not to kill, not to lie, not to steal, not to engage in sexual misconduct, and not to consume intoxicants. Monks follow many more rules. The most essential doctrinal aspect is the four noble truths: first, the truth of Dukkha, that life is suffering; second, that attachment causes suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture is a crucial factor in any negotiation, as it can be understood by both what it encompasses and what it doesn't. Culture is not uniform or a single entity, nor is it a specific trait. Generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are overly simplistic and broad. While knowing cultural generalizations can be useful, it is more beneficial for a negotiator to grasp how the culture influences the negotiation context and how it might impact the discussions. When encountering a foreign culture, individuals often relate it to their own, leading to comparisons.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset may require exploring its history and acknowledging its biases. Instead of judging or trying to alter a culture, it is crucial to accept it as it is and operate within its confines, particularly in negotiations, especially when one has a weaker bargaining position. Similarly, showing respect for traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and advance the negotiation when a negotiator is on foreign ground.\n\nIt's also essential to recognize that culture extends beyond national or international boundaries. Companies within the same country often develop their own corporate culture. For example, a company might prioritize long working hours or a more flexible schedule. Corporate culture can be observed through employee dress codes, communication styles (direct or indirect), and hiring practices. Some companies promote philanthropy at all levels, while others limit it to \"company-approved\" charities or events. The differences in American corporate culture from one company to another (and even within regions or between urban and suburban areas) illustrate the diversity of thought within a societal culture. Some cultures may seem less stratified than American culture and appear more uniform to outsiders, but this similarity is merely an invitation to explore further.\n\nUnderstanding values is even more critical, as they explain the reasons behind a culture's behaviors. In cultures that value saving face or communal harmony, negotiators are unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superiors to succeed. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that prioritizes hard bargaining may not be eager to settle quickly. Considering these generalities is vital before entering negotiations. However, it is advantageous for a negotiator to also learn about their counterpart on a personal level to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "The phrase \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God,’\" originally appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and serves as the starting point for St. Anselm’s discussion on God's existence. This perspective is also shared by Thomas Aquinas, another author we will examine. Since both authors argue in favor of the same idea, and our task is to assess which argument is superior, we will assume for brevity's sake that both authors are correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God described in the Bible. Allowing for a different concept of God would prevent a proper comparison of their arguments, as both are essentially defending the same idea of God. However, while both authors present valid points, neither offers a comprehensive foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo explore this, we will first consider St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm emphasizes understanding through faith, suggesting that one can find evidence of God within oneself. He argues that because God exists in our understanding, we cannot truly imagine His nonexistence. Although his explanation can be complex and sometimes unclear, the central idea is that proof of God resides in one's mind. Anselm suggests that we don't need external evidence to find truth about God; the truth of God's existence can be discovered by examining what we inherently know to be true within ourselves. This acceptance of something without irrefutable empirical evidence is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas argues that God's existence can be demonstrated solely through reason and empirical evidence, without the need for faith. This approach is advantageous in evangelism, a key aspect of Christianity, as it allows for the conversion of new believers based on logic alone, without requiring them to accept something unproven. Aquinas presents five logical arguments to support God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each case, he essentially shows that the necessity of God is a logical conclusion. Just as knowing one puzzle piece is missing allows you to deduce its features and existence without seeing it, logic leads to the conclusion of God's existence.",
            "Numerous authors employ various methods to evoke specific emotions or attitudes in their readers regarding significant topics. Some of these methods are more impactful than others. In his novel, The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes several such techniques. Occasionally, Fitzgerald combines an adjective and a noun in an unconventional manner to create a particular atmosphere around a subject. At other times, he assigns meaning to a symbol and uses it for a similar purpose. He notably employs this latter technique with colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald develops meanings for colors, especially white/gray and red/pink, and later uses these meanings to evoke a specific feeling related to an important object.\n\nFor white/gray, Fitzgerald creates a meaning of uniformity, with white representing something slightly nicer and of higher class, and gray symbolizing something older and more faded. This meaning is established early in the novel through frequent use of these colors. Daisy and Jordan are often described as being “in white” (8)—indeed, many characters wear white: Nick dons “white flannels” (41) for Gatsby’s party, Tom wears a “white shirt” (36) when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). The only instance where white is not present is when Nick observes Gatsby’s party, where “the halls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these colors by applying them to ordinary, insignificant subjects: Nick commutes “down the white chasms of lower New York” (56), the names on Gatsby’s party guest list appear as “gray names” (61) on Nick’s timetable, and Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—symbolizing uniformity (28). He also describes ordinary people or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy shared a “white girlhood” (19), there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of ashes, the “Italian child” on the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established the meaning of white/gray, he uses these colors to indicate unimportance or uniformity in certain subjects. This use of color to convey meaning begins with Daisy. After a significant gap in the use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster,” leading readers to perceive Daisy as less of a character and more of a uniform element, something Gatsby desires (74). Fitzgerald further employs this technique around Daisy to suggest her as a uniform element, such as the “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is once more in a “white” (115) dress before the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County boasts a highly productive agricultural sector, largely due to its temperate and sunny weather. Crops commonly grown include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a strong demand for organic produce through community-supported agriculture in the San Diego region, with many local groups having extensive waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Moreover, numerous organic farms offer tours of their farming operations and provide opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. Such operations enable landowners to benefit from government programs while simultaneously enhancing habitats, allowing for recreational use, and creating avenues for farm tours and educational purposes, which can generate income.\n\nBy tapping into a potentially lucrative niche market, organic farming also promotes greater biodiversity among plants and wildlife, as it avoids the use of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming can incur higher costs than conventional farming. It demands more labor and management to control pests and weeds and to fertilize without chemicals, often resulting in greater losses compared to conventional methods. Small organic farms also lack the economies of scale that larger operations benefit from. Practices that are beneficial to wildlife but not necessarily related to organic farming can also increase labor costs, such as planting cover crops, rotating grazing strategically, removing invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create specific habitats like edge areas or open ground patches. Hence, there are various reasons why a landowner in this situation might seek financial assistance or expert advice to maximize profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land selected for this example is a 160-acre parcel near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It consists of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. It is situated in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which is still under review but currently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many species, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, are endangered, while others like burrowing owls are declining and may soon be listed.\n\nHistorically, Native Americans inhabited this area for countless centuries before it was later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This tract of land was part of an original homestead patent and likely used for grazing or wood production over the years.\n\nI chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to explore the options a small farmer might have to reduce costs and maintain wildlife-friendly practices. To model what farming on this land might achieve, I identified an organic farm in the same vicinity.",
            "There exists a strong connection between brothers; one that is unbreakable and permanent. This connection encompasses a range of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, among others. Brothers have a deep understanding of each other, more so than anyone else connected in this way, and they see a reflection of themselves in one another. The true nature of this bond becomes evident in critical situations, whether for better or worse. When these emotions surface, they come at a significant cost. Understanding the emotions that spring from this brotherly link involves dealing with the outcomes they produce. When a person can look into their brother's eyes and see their own reflection, they perceive themselves not as others do, but as they truly are. Their true character is revealed through their actions and the consequences that follow. In “The Scarlet Ibis,” two brothers delve into this theme and the turbulent emotions that come with it. Against a richly detailed backdrop, these two boys embark on an ultimately futile journey. In the climax, bitter disappointment meets intense pride, and only one brother survives. The theme is conveyed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, their interactions, and the narrator’s perspective, which communicates the protagonist's complex emotions and his perception of the world, both of which greatly influence his actions. The protagonist’s actions are driven by one main emotion: pride. From the moment he and his younger brother, Doodle, go out together, to their final, tragic outing, the protagonist harbors resentment toward Doodle. He had hoped for a brother to whom he could teach various skills, like \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp.\" He wanted a sibling who could be his companion in races to Horsehead Landing and someone to sit with at the top of the great pine behind the barn. However, due to Doodle’s frail heart, surviving was uncertain, and participating in strenuous physical activities was nearly impossible. The young protagonist’s dreams were shattered instantly, which was a significant disappointment. He even admits to feeling anger towards Doodle, once considering suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would contemplate such an act? Yet, his heart softened when Doodle smiled at him, a simple act that filled him with hope. This indicates that his resolve was not very strong — deep down, he had an innate love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex and inventive system for processing information. As technology evolved from rudimentary to sophisticated, so did the metaphors used to describe the brain. It was first likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, a book, and most recently, a computer. When studying the brain, remember that these metaphors have limitations and can lead to incorrect assumptions.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory organ input, which converts physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light photons into electrochemical signals. The brain's algorithms repeatedly transform this sensory information through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles basic information such as color, orientation, and edges—where color shifts abruptly over a short distance—to determine that a box is present. Top-down processing then uses decisions from earlier bottom-up steps to expedite recognition of the box. In this case, top-down processing might help identify the object as a black box instead of a box-shaped void in the white background.\n\nAfter a certain level of processing, an attention filter evaluates the signal's significance and determines which cognitive processes it should be accessible to. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you glance at your shoes, a healthy attention filter keeps you from noticing each one individually. Conversely, you might notice your name spoken even in a noisy room. There are multiple stages of processing, and attention repeatedly influences the results.\n\nBefore the brain can process information, it must be stored. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded, with specific encoding methods for each type of sensory input. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally (appearance of the printed word), phonemically (the sound of the word), or semantically (the meaning of the word). Once stored, information must be maintained. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which retains information for around 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons temporarily. Long-term memory is thought to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are several models for organizing knowledge in the brain, some based on how humans recall memories, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that nodes represent concepts, with links based on relatedness. For instance, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which could connect to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States was engulfed by a severe financial crisis. Unemployment soared, the housing market collapsed, and numerous major corporations in the country were left devastated. This recession continues today, prompting questions about its origins and prevention measures. Essentially, the crisis resulted from shortsighted and self-serving political decisions that compelled banks and firms to issue subprime loans within an underdeveloped and inadequate financial framework. Concurrently, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were urged to underwrite and repurpose these mortgages into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit default swaps (CDS). When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves, spreading the disarray to these repackaged mortgages and ultimately affecting the broader economy.\n\nThe financial crisis traces back to 1999 during President Clinton's era, as he sought to secure a second term by boosting his popularity. To achieve this, the Clinton administration eased lending restrictions, setting the stage for the subprime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes accurately predicted the potential consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As outlined earlier, and as Holmes predicted, reckless lending was bound to lead to economic collapse.\n\nNumerous factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the complex nature of mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years leading to the crisis, further entangling various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This overexposure made U.S. households and financial markets highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nThe housing bubble inevitably burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in these mortgage-backed securities at a loss. In 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts, representing about 30% of the nation's GDP. Ultimately, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at low prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to transform into commercial banks under stringent regulation. Fannie and Freddie amassed $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That part of your story where you spread your writer's wings and soar, impressing everyone with your captivating, even enchanting prose. Or perhaps it's the section where your readers drift off or hit the \"Back\" button while muttering curses under their breath. Dr. Merlin is known to shout at her screen when she encounters an overload of information, and not in an enjoyable way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy gentle readers are familiar with the basic writing advice, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself trapped in lengthy passages where nothing happens, or there's too much going on. Exposition is that little devil on your shoulder urging you to lay out the history to get to the exciting parts (not to be confused with the devil on the other shoulder encouraging the author to reveal every detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition involves telling the audience what occurred, often in straightforward prose. In films, exposition happens when one character dumps a load of information on another, reminiscent of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nAn illustration is needed. As you read a story, you're informed that the heroine met her beloved at a certain place and time, they wed in a grand manner, and her husband was murdered before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to unfold over two pages, with both having only two lines of dialogue each. You'd expect the author to explore the husband's character, showing through his speech and actions how much he loves his wife, and you'd also expect the heroine to demonstrate in various ways how his presence transformed and enriched her life (especially if the story later explicitly states this). A thorough introduction to the husband's character would engage you emotionally with his fate and provide insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, the depth of their bond, and hints about her thoughts and dreams reflected through his perspective, among other things. You would mourn his death with her, thus growing more connected to the heroine.\n\nIn summary, you'd expect more depth on the simple storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to add that depth. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, continues*) Sometimes, the temptation is to rush through certain elements. Maybe you're introducing a new character and know he used to be in the Air Force, is now the night manager of a gas station, was married twice, has no kids, enjoys fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was a live broadcast from NBC 4 on the morning of August 13, 2011. The main story covered a man named Shad Hostettler in Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife multiple times. Even though they didn't mention her name, they showed Hostettler's mug shot, portraying him as quite menacing. The report on this developing story lasted about two minutes, which I felt was appropriate given the circumstances. \n\nThe second story involved an early morning shooting victim, 18-year-old Travis Buyers, who was critically injured in the Sharon Woods area. At the time, there were no arrests or suspects, and the SWAT Team was investigating. This report was brief, and I suspect that might be because the victim was a black man or from a black neighborhood. I've noticed, over the years, that crimes involving minorities often receive less media attention compared to similar incidents involving white victims. \n\nAnother story discussed the discovery of a bullet hole in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details included the location of the suspected incident and that a .22 caliber rifle bullet was responsible. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the shooter. \n\nThe forecast for rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon was also mentioned. Temperatures were expected to stay in the mid to low 80s over the weekend. This segment was brief, likely intended as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in. \n\nThey also reported on a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus, describing the suspect as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie, approximately six feet tall and weighing around 150 pounds. I found it odd that they emphasized the suspect's race and skin tone so much. \n\nAnother segment covered Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin, involved in a conspiracy to distribute large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, instead of saying he was sentenced to 25 years in prison, they stated \"300 months,\" which seemed to be intended to sound harsher. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, which I didn't think was relevant to the story.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of security that aims to track the performance of an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund. However, unlike index funds, ETFs offer greater flexibility as they are traded like stocks on exchanges. ETFs allow investors to enjoy the diversification benefits of an index fund while also providing the advantages of individual stock ownership, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as few as one share per transaction. Although these features are highly appealing, ETFs typically have much lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund. On the downside, trading ETFs incurs a commission fee, similar to stock trades. Another advantage of ETFs is the wide range of funds available. Despite these benefits being clearly outlined, it is wise for astute investors to assess whether the claimed benefits, such as diversification, truly exist and to what degree. For this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to evaluate if the advantages of owning a single ETF are comparable to possessing a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, and whether there might be better configurations of these stocks to achieve an optimal Sharpe ratio or return.  \nTo assess the ETF, we will focus on the top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's total assets, as including every holding would be impractical. The top 10 holdings and their asset percentages are listed below.  \nTo estimate how well these ten stocks represent the entire ETF IHF, we can use their current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate each stock's contribution to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consists solely of these 10 stocks in the proportions set by the ETF. The Beta and return calculations are provided in the chart below.  \nThe chart shows that a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings yields a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, translating to a 16% increase in returns. It also shows that the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the entire ETF. Based on these results, a portfolio comprising just the top 10 holdings could potentially offer higher returns with a lower beta. However, it's possible that the means of these two portfolios might not differ significantly from each other statistically.  \nTo determine if these portfolios are statistically different, we calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their combined standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Referring to Figure 17, there was a sharp decline in commuter log submissions during the project's third month, which was somewhat disheartening, and the reasons for this are unclear. The arrival of winter on a New England campus likely led to fewer people commuting by bicycle or on foot, contributing to the decrease. December also signifies the end of the fall semester when everyone is preoccupied with completing schoolwork and processing grades, possibly causing the commuter log to be overlooked. Additionally, December ushers in the busy holiday season and a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many do not need to come to campus. Classes resume for the spring semester in late January, which might explain the low number of logs for that month. However, this doesn't fully account for the low submissions in February. It is possible that projects of this nature experience an initial surge of enthusiasm that naturally wanes over time. To counter this trend, we initiated the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a focused campaign that successfully boosted log submissions for that month. Thus, one challenge was maintaining project momentum despite a natural decline in engagement, along with the specific issue of holiday and semester breaks in higher education. \n\nAnother challenge for this project, or any alternative commuting project, is the widespread preference for the freedom, independence, and flexibility that driving offers, which is deeply ingrained in our culture. Therefore, it is crucial to provide incentives for alternative commuting. We offered numerous prizes, such as gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see the impact of larger prizes on participation, such as a bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car, which might have helped address the dip in engagement. The nature of the prizes remained consistent throughout the project. If the prize value had increased over time, it might have helped. The gift cards seemed sufficient at the project's start, but announcing the addition of bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January might have boosted participation and engagement instead of seeing a decline.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films typically utilize creative editing to create illusions. My film analysis primarily focused on defining the stylistic elements of most trick films and investigating the unique features found in some of the later ones. Generally, trick films from the turn of the century are confined to a set, structured within a frontal proscenium, lack camera movement, use long and medium shots, and follow the one shot = one film principle. However, a few films from the early 1900s deviate from these norms by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA key characteristic shared by these films is their use of an indoor set framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary in its proscenium position, not following figures or objects. This style was prevalent in early cinema, influenced by theater and, in trick films, vaudeville and magic performances. A limitation of this stage setup is that characters in trick films generally move side-to-side, avoiding movement toward or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move horizontally. Even when they exit the frame, the camera remains still.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition also results in predominantly long shots, with medium shots being less common. Close-ups are absent from any of the Edison trick films. This mirrors the theater and vaudeville tradition, where audiences view the entire performance at once, framed by the stage. In early films, actors do not approach the camera from the middle distance, so close-ups are not used.\n\nMost early trick films adhere to the principle that one conceptual shot constitutes the entire film. This confines the duration of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. It also limits the narrative potential of the films, which mostly focus on brief vaudeville-style tricks like magic, disappearing acts, and transformations with minimal storytelling. However, in trick films, a single conceptual shot is not necessarily one physical shot. A \"shot\" may consist of several shots combined to create illusions of appearing or disappearing. For instance, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a close examination shows where the physical shot starts with Mary's \"head\" being removed, though to the viewer, the film appears as a single conceptual shot.",
            "Ian Watt, in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel,\" refers to the traditional \"Gothic Novel\" as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" highlighting its contradictory nature both in substance and name. The Gothic style has faced criticism and praise alike, with some accusing it of lacking depth while others celebrate its ability to evoke the 'terrible sublime,' as noted by Burke. Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" the first \"Gothic Novel,\" fused elements of \"ancient and modern\" romances to pioneer the proto-Gothic genre and develop a new literary form. Walpole incorporated \"old\" theatrical techniques and 'new' naturalistic imitations in 'modern' novels to craft what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre often incorporates elements from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. At the time \"The Castle of Otranto\" was published, \"gothic\" was used to describe a variety of peoples, styles, and epochs, often seen as outdated or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The blend of theatrical \"Gothic\" elements with the novel's format, which provides a more intimate glimpse into character psychology, has allowed the Gothic genre to endure, appearing both outdated and novel to readers far removed in time from its original creation.\n\nA key concept in Gothic novels is Chivalry. The medieval notion of chivalry, the training of a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Chivalry holds special significance for Gothic writers due to its representation of the quintessential knight—brave, honorable, and skilled—and the perceived absence of such ideals in society, particularly noted by Walpole. By incorporating chivalric ideals and behaviors, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, hinting at the Gothic genre's evolution towards Romanticism, and is used as a means to critique and potentially improve the present. While writing \"The Castle of Otranto,\" Walpole was amidst political turmoil and was concerned about the future. Immersed in politics and facing possibly unjust accusations, he might have believed that the morality and inherent \"goodness\" of people from the gothic era had been lost in contemporary society. This idea is evident in his characters, such as Frederic, who is portrayed with many chivalric qualities. Frederic is described as a prince who has endured hardship, been affected by tragedy, and is believed to have been killed by infidels. The depiction of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, introducing the Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the series of processes involved in moving goods from the point of customer order through stages of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution to the customer. This concept was introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who detailed the comprehensive process of planning, executing, and overseeing supply chain activities to meet customer needs effectively and efficiently. The supply chain is composed of six essential components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these components to deliver optimal customer service. \n\nProduction marks the initial phase of the supply chain process, serving as the backbone for the entire series of operations. This stage defines the timing, reasons, locations, and methods for production. Managers must understand customer preferences, which can be discerned by analyzing market trends. The market acts as a primary indicator of customer demand. Once managers understand this demand, they can determine which products to produce and in what quantities. Subsequently, they decide on the optimal production sites and facilities that will meet the required volume and quality, ensuring customer satisfaction. Following the selection of production locations, managers then concentrate on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. Production is a crucial step within the supply chain, and every detail must be meticulously planned to avoid costly errors in time and resources over the long term. For instance, when I worked at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores, both companies had detailed guides and processes for various business aspects, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. Such structured processes enable smooth operations and clarity in roles and expectations.\n\nThe second critical component in supply chain management is supply. Supply involves strategic decision-making to identify the essential capabilities of a facility, and it determines the development of outsourcing partnerships. A single product may have multiple production divisions, each with unique equipment, personnel, and expertise. Managers must evaluate which division best suits different product processes. Additionally, management might opt to outsource certain tasks to other companies. The primary motivation for outsourcing is to enhance velocity, which is the ability to deliver quality and flexibility while simultaneously reducing or maintaining low cost levels.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous detail and focus on the period's aristocracy. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, while considered Victorian, diverge from this tradition. Both novels incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, which are not typical of the era's literature, thereby enhancing the characters and offering deeper insights into their motivations and emotions.\n\n\"Now, a torrent of bewildering and confusing thoughts surged through his mind. He felt as if he was still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were fiercely arguing; their words echoed in his ears, and he realized he was talking to them himself. Suddenly, he jolted at the sound of gunshots; cries and shouts filled the air, lights flashed before his eyes, and noise and chaos surrounded him as an unseen force whisked him away. Amidst these swift visions, he felt a vague, uneasy sense of pain that constantly wearied and tormented him.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nThe two novels frequently use mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, with varying content and purpose in each case. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences often reveal insights into Oliver’s inner self, his suffering, and his awareness of the true nature of his surroundings. When the incident of Oliver being shot is revisited in chapter 28, he re-experiences the event vividly, as if in a dream, while struggling to seek help. This passage highlights Oliver's lack of control over the unfolding events and the precarious state of his health, emphasized by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms his senses; he doesn't notice the \"unseen hand\" that carries him away, reliving the despair detached from the initial shock since the pain has become constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. This overwhelming experience raises questions about who is responsible for his misfortune, as it is certainly not his own doing. The shooting underscores that Oliver has little control over anything, unable to even attempt to influence the outcome of events, even when his life is at stake. This passage implies a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if old Fagin is beginning to break him, pushing him to accept despair and diminishing his ability to react. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least to save his own life.\n\n\"The day passed – day! There was no day; it vanished as soon as it appeared – and night returned; a night so long, yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years back, I was involved in an after-school program where I tutored elementary students. I aimed to assist them in any subject they found challenging, although my expertise lay in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to help a young boy named Adrian, who was in the third or fourth grade and faced significant difficulties with reading. It struck me that there was an unusual issue; while he could pronounce some letters perfectly, others eluded him entirely. Despite his Latino heritage, Adrian spoke flawless English. We encountered several challenges until I met his mother while supervising a few students who didn’t attend a field trip. Adrian's mother spoke only Spanish, and with my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate. That’s when I realized Adrian's issue wasn’t reading itself but his unfamiliarity with the English alphabet. Although I'm unsure if this insight made a difference for him, I hope he is doing better now. \n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issue in schools, particularly in California, and to illustrate that it’s not always as evident as it seems. Even children who speak perfect English can face substantial challenges in reading. While I think everyone acknowledges the existence of this problem, the question remains: how do we address it? For Adrian, the solution was straightforward: English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children who are not fluent in English, the solution is more complicated. There's no single answer. A combination of dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes is essential.\n\nThe dual language system is an excellent concept, not just for Spanish-speaking students but for all children. Studies show that children in two-way bilingual education programs often outperform their peers academically. Despite fears that such programs waste resources and offer no benefit to most students, this is untrue. If these programs were standard rather than exceptions, all students would benefit. But how do we implement this? Requiring all teachers to be bilingual is impractical. Nevertheless, there's no reason we can't employ bilingual aides or tutors.",
            "From a young age, many of us are taught that there exists something greater than ourselves, something beyond our understanding. Some are taken to Sunday school to learn about it, others attend Temple, or look inward for answers. Many people easily embrace the religions passed down by their parents, while others completely reject them, believing there's nothing beyond their personal, self-centered world. We might adopt one belief system only to later change to another. Regardless of the path we take, we embark on a journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique views on spirituality. We seek a guiding light in the darkness to lead us out of the shadows and into the sunshine.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father answered when I asked him about his favorite bird. We sat on our front porch, listening to the rain drumming on the tin roof overhead while we shared cigarettes. The gutters channeled the rain down, overwhelming the plants by the porch. He gazed into the rain with a look that seemed both searching and remembering. Over the past months, he had become thinner, his clothes hanging loosely on his body, and his hair had thinned more than I recalled. He continued to look into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, scared, and unable to express to my father how much I would miss him, because speaking about it would make it all too real for us both. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer to his, and joined him in watching the rain fall on that June evening.\n\nMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation did not ease his suffering but prolonged his life a few months beyond what the doctors had predicted; the value of this extension, given his continued suffering, was unclear to me. I questioned what kind of God would allow this to happen. Alone at night, I offered no prayers. If God existed, I felt he had long stopped listening to me.\n\nI couldn’t bear to watch him transition from this life to the next, so I didn’t. I couldn’t watch the life that brought me into existence come to an end. I wanted to remember my father for how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew him better than anyone else, and I knew he wouldn’t want his only child to witness his death. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate for Republicanism. Although primarily an agriculturist, his profession and brief political career shaped him into a man known for his commitment and outspoken views on personal freedom and governance. His support for an agrarian system underpinned nearly all his governmental opinions. His effort to preserve and promote what he saw as the most noble profession influenced his perspectives on sovereignty, the Constitution, and even the judicial system.\n\nJohn Taylor believed the United States had a unique opportunity to establish an ideal system due to the absence of native traditions that might constrain the government's founders, enabling the creation of a self-governed society. He was a strong believer in the natural rights of individuals, emphasizing that these rights are interconnected, so if one is denied, all are compromised, reducing the value of those remaining. Thus, these rights should remain beyond governmental reach. He argued that what some termed the \"state of nature\" allowed those with physical strength and cunning intelligence to thrive, but in a civilization, this should not be the case.\n\nTo build this ideal society, Taylor believed a government must be established that considers the inherent good and evil within humans. He was firm in his views on dualistic morality, stating that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that protect private property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalism, believing that a government founded on good principles would operate fairly regardless of its leadership, which would inevitably be driven by greed and self-interest. He regarded self-interest as the driving force behind all human actions, considering it only evil when it resulted in societies that thrived at others' expense. A good government was essential to restrain man's natural evil, and even then, it needed close scrutiny to prevent the incorporation of harmful principles.\n\nLike many steadfast Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He desired a very limited Federal government, with no more rights or powers than those explicitly outlined in the Constitution. He recognized that an expansive Federal government would be costly and potentially despotic. However, he believed a simplistic, literal interpretation was dangerous, as it could easily become corrupt without considering the authors' intent. Furthermore, he viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind blankly processing the scene before me. With a detached, silent focus, my awareness observed without connecting the subject to any abstract ideas, analyzing the image in front of my eyes. Thoughts drifted into my mind and disappeared almost as quickly as they arrived. My consciousness functioned so smoothly and effortlessly that it felt as if I had no independent thoughts, just an active, fluid experience of what I was observing. \n\nOnce, following advice from an artist I collaborated with, I bought an art instruction book titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had wanted to learn to draw since I was six years old, and this book covers everything from understanding a pencil to how the brain interprets lines. One technique it teaches is to place a square frame around any image the artist wants to study, transforming a complex scene—like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room—into a simple, focused image of just the bowl of fruit on a plain surface. \n\nAt that moment, as I looked down at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't mentally apply that artist's frame. Overwhelmed and in awe, all I could do was stand and marvel. Picasso had his blue period, Monet adored greenery, and Italian Renaissance masters displayed a spectrum of colors. If I aspired to claim my perspective as Artistic, then before me lay the beginnings of my work, the inception of my story, Work in Brown. \n\nMy fingertips touched my chosen tool of artistry, muscles tensing and relaxing as my hand moved through space, my mind's intent taking shape in what could have been my most creative moment. Water swirled, serene and clear. Flakes of matter separated from the whole, carried away to oblivion. Muscles tightened and spasmed more anxiously on the second attempt as my hand struck the toilet handle again. The stubborn brown mass remained immobile, clinging to the toilet bottom like a slug.\n\nWith a mop held loosely in my hand, feet spaced a foot apart, and a green tie uncomfortably knotted around my neck, I frowned at the offensive bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the unlucky cleaners at Rite Aid. After a few more flushes and some tranquil, introspective moments, my hand reached for the toilet paper, wrapped it around itself until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing upright, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the toilet, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "Teenagers are losing their lives in car accidents, and several factors contribute to this alarming trend among the youngest drivers in America. According to the National Institutes of Health, one part of the issue is that the teen brain is not yet equipped to handle the dangers of driving. Additionally, lack of experience is a significant factor, leading not only to more fatal crashes but also to an increased rate of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and off-road incidents.  \nTeenagers also tend to have worse outcomes when they are driving with their peers—a common occurrence. Research from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has demonstrated a link between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents.  \nIn an effort to improve teen driver safety, California and other states have implemented temporary provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit other minors from being passengers.  \nHowever, I believe provisional licenses are merely temporary fixes. The core issue is that, as a group, the youngest drivers are statistically unable to manage the risks and responsibilities effectively. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman even suggests that 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license. His research, reported by USA Today, indicates a prevalent desire among those under 19-20 to engage in risk-taking for the thrill. Therefore, delaying driving until this thrill-seeking tendency diminishes seems logical. Continuing to grant licenses to young teens will likely result in ongoing fatal accidents, with the death toll expected to rise significantly in the coming years. By 2010, the children of Baby Boomers will be eligible to drive, adding millions of new teenage drivers to the roads.  \nAddressing this issue through legislation would be relatively straightforward. Schools could maintain driver’s education classes to start the learning process, but no one under 18 would be allowed to drive. A provisional permit could be issued before a full license, and a certain number of training hours would still be required. This number could be based on current state requirements (for instance, California mandates 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of adult-supervised practice). Since the concerning statistics for teen drivers emerge nationwide, a uniform, national law would be a sensible and effective way to protect teens across the country.  \nThe legislation I propose is not a new concept.",
            "This paper explores three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with a concise definition of the disorder, followed by an explanation of its diagnosis, highlighting common traits or \"red flags.\" The paper concludes with strategies for teachers in mainstream classrooms to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), pertains to how efficiently and effectively the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. Specifically, it involves the perceptual processing of sound information in the CNS and the neurobiological activity that supports this processing, leading to electrophysiological auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it is a disorder where the brain struggles to process auditory input accurately. Individuals with CAPD have normal hearing and are not considered \"hearing impaired\"; rather, the brain region responsible for interpreting sounds, such as distinguishing words or separating conversation from background noise, does not function as it typically should.\n\nThe earliest reference to what is now known as CAPD dates back to the mid-1950s, when it was referred to as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Researchers were studying children with communication disorders at that time. In 1954, the Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children, and by 1961, Kimura had introduced dichotic testing and developed a model to explain the physiology of the central auditory nervous system involved in dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 spurred further research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD can present in various ways: individuals may struggle to localize or hear sounds in space, have difficulty distinguishing between different \"acoustic events\" (sound occurrences), fail to recognize sound patterns, or be unable to detect changes in speech, such as sarcasm indicated by tone shifts. Subsequent sounds might block earlier ones, they might lack the ability to synthesize auditory clues into meaningful information to act upon, and they may struggle to identify the sequence of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, patients undergo \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,\" which may be administered by \"audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using various measures that evaluate auditory-related skills\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This process may involve questionnaires, surveys, and observation of how patients respond to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single tool or test consistently used with a high success rate for diagnosis, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Many tests involve presenting the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and asking them to differentiate certain elements, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to these signals.",
            "In choosing to study social work, my goal is to build a career with the Division of Family and Children Services to assist children who have suffered abuse or neglect, and to support families facing difficulties. The values I bring to the field of social work include service, respect, ethical behavior, a commitment to enhancing relationships among people, and a dedication to my own professional development to remain effective in my role. These values are not only essential for social workers but are also personally significant to me.\n\nI have always wanted to help others, though I was initially unsure of the exact career I wanted to pursue. During high school and college, I observed many people avoiding their problems or using less than ideal coping strategies. These experiences led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, still uncertain about my career path, I decided to take a break. One summer day, a friend introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy in her home, who was there to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he had contacted the police about his situation. I went to his parents' home to see if I could assist. I privately shared my concerns with the police, mentioning my recent Psychology degree. They asked me to speak with the parents, as the law offered no immediate solution for the teenager. In conversation, the parents appeared uneasy and made excuses about their son's \"manipulative\" behavior in seeking outside help for \"simple\" family disputes. This experience prompted me to seriously consider a career in social work to aid children facing family conflicts.\n\nAnother critical value in social work is social justice. As a society, we claim to value individuals and mourn those we lose. However, the societal concept of an \"individual\" often aligns more with old traditions than true uniqueness. If society truly values individuals, why do we strive to conform? I consider myself an individual and resist limiting myself to fit in with others. Throughout high school and college, I protested social injustice by expressing myself through unconventional hair colors, wearing clothes that reflected my personality, getting additional ear piercings, participating in GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and opposing racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. I am committed to social justice and will continue to stand against social injustices.",
            "This paper examines the Biological and Sociocultural models as they relate to insomnia. The Biological model emphasizes inherited genetic factors and medical health aspects, while the Sociocultural model considers environmental interactions and their relevance to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The review of insomnia explores these models and details each selected piece of research to better elucidate the models. The research and its conclusions are then critiqued to highlight their particular strengths and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary sleep disorders, those related to another mental disorder, or those linked to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, whereas those related to another mental disorder are associated with an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other sleep disorder categories may arise from medical issues or substance use. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves problems with obtaining or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia pertains to difficulties staying awake, both persisting for at least a month. Narcolepsy is characterized by cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. Dyssomnias focus on the initiation and maintenance of sleep, whereas Parasomnias relate to sleep disorders with behavioral or physiological anomalies. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders linked to another mental disorder involve sleep challenges due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily considers insomnia and, to some extent, primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders centers on genetic, heritable, and physiologically acquired aspects. Hypothalamic neurons containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. Research on mice demonstrated that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons play a crucial role in sleep/wake states. Activating the GABAA receptor induces sleep-promoting responses, and inhibiting its firing can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) was shown to increase sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that mouse models may be applicable to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or deficiency with this receptor might impair one's ability to achieve sufficient sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if this phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and any alteration to the receptor might naturally disrupt sleep, adversely affecting aspects of life such as education, career, and routine tasks requiring sustained attention.",
            "I have been studying here at University Park for nearly two and a half years, which amounts to four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many, myself included. During my freshman year, I lived in a dorm room in East Halls, which is about as far east as you can get on campus, aside from the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my dorm in Stuart Hall to classes in distant buildings like Willard, which is near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes, particularly in the often inclement weather of State College. An alum I spoke with, who isn't much older than me, mentioned that not long ago, East Halls used to be separated from the main campus by large areas of undeveloped land. Now, those areas have been developed with sports fields, large new buildings like the Creamery and a new health services building, and are surrounded by apartments. As the campus continues to grow, getting around becomes increasingly difficult. The best solution for improving mobility on a college campus is the bicycle. However, simply having bikes isn't enough; students need to use them, and the campus must be designed to accommodate cyclists.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who has started biking again after several years, and he expressed surprise at why he ever stopped. “Bikes are fantastic,” he said, “for a while it wasn’t trendy to ride a bike, but it’s the most practical way to get around.” Besides being beneficial for health, biking is the most efficient mode of transportation. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical effort can take you over 30 miles. Like many other students, I now live off-campus, just as far from the campus center as some dorms. Buying a bike has been my best decision this year. I have classes in the Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. Biking can reduce that time to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. The only issue is that Pollock Road, the most direct route to the Thomas building from my home, isn’t always easy to navigate, whether you're biking or not. Walking has its merits too, but I’m too busy to walk everywhere. Without my bike, walking would be my sole reliable means of getting to class. Walking to Thomas daily would consume an extra 30-40 minutes of my time each day, totaling over two and a half hours weekly. Adding the time spent walking to other classes, appointments, and more, it’s more time than I can afford to lose.",
            "In \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley critiques the looming dangers posed by technology and the capitalist framework that supports it, by depicting a dystopian society. The inhabitants of this society prioritize community over individuality and are conditioned from birth to seek immediate gratification above everything else. These citizens are mere pawns in a vast scheme, bound to a single ideology as dictated by the World Controller. Analyzing the novel through a Marxist lens reveals Huxley's skepticism about the evolution of these systems. Marxist concepts such as homogeny and reification underscore the idea that Huxley's work comments on the pitfalls of the burgeoning economy of his era.\n\nCapitalism is satirized using the Marxist concept of false consciousness, which asserts that ordinary citizens are kept ignorant of their true economic relationships with other classes, as they focus primarily on personal gain. This is said to result from the ideological control of the proletariat and common workers, a point that is evident in the conditioning seen in \"Brave New World.\" The lower classes, like the Deltas and Gammas, lack genuine free will; their desire to consume and indulge is amplified through hypnopaedia, as orchestrated by the World Controller. Hegemony, where social classes are entirely dominated by a distinct group of individuals, is clearly at play. The lower classes are unaware of their manipulation, literally buying into an ideology that supports capitalism and consumerism. Though the upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, have the potential to recognize this manipulation, few, apart from characters like Bernard, challenge their roles. The interactions among social classes highlight the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" genuine relationships among different individuals are nonexistent. The novel seems to avoid giving depth to its characters, even among the main ones, possibly suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism strips humanity of free will and expression. Love and strong emotions are absent, with interactions remaining shallow. This is depicted through men's comments on women's physical traits and women's candid remarks about their experiences. Moreover, the complacency of each societal class with their place in the hierarchy reflects the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their complete adherence to their roles in the community is indicative of Marxist views on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their superiority as long as they continue to consume and conform.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I attended a course on Islam at CBC. A major topic of debate in the class was whether Islam is an aggressive religion. I believe this issue is even more pertinent now than ever. Reflecting on events since 9/11, I've noticed the mass media shift from a hostile perspective on Islam and extremists to an extreme tolerance for Islam in America. In 2001, it would have seemed unlikely for someone with the name Borac Obama, who has evident Muslim roots in his family, to run for president.\n\nThe Prophet's biography fascinates me because, based on my understanding of Muhammad's history, it seems to contradict his personality. From what I've learned, I assumed Muhammad converted people to Islam by force, conquering tribes and compelling them to adopt Islam. However, the biography portrays Muhammad as a misunderstood martyr who humbled himself before others, eventually attracting followers who recognized the 'truth' in his teachings.\n\nAdditionally, there are striking similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' attributed to Muhammad. Notably, he is said to have multiplied mutton and milk to feed more than forty men. This narrative style suggests the authors intended to depict Muhammad as a humble prophet who simply lived in truth and performed miracles, without needing to prove anything. I find this problematic because it undermines the miracles and life of Jesus Christ, as if credit for Jesus' life is being claimed through Muhammad.\n\nThe biography also contains numerous stories that seem to aim at providing evidence of 'witness' or people converting to Islam 'on their own.' However, many stories are from third-party perspectives, where the author recounts hearing from someone who heard from someone else, and so on. I disliked this approach because, although intended to validate the stories, it made them seem less credible and more dubious.\n\nWhat disturbs me most about the work is its attempts to glorify Muhammad as a godly figure who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. Yet, historical accounts contradict the portrayal of Muhammad as gentle and humble, and I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus during his lifetime were quickly left behind as Christian thought evolved after his death. Observing this historical trajectory broadly, we notice Christianity drifting further from its roots. In today's world, there is a growing awareness and a remarkable progressive trend. While some traditionalists persist and resist thinking beyond their learned teachings, they may not be influential enough to sway the majority. Among Christians, historical understanding will significantly increase in future years. There will be a widespread desire to separate doctrines that were later added to Christianity from the original intentions of its founder. This process may take decades or even centuries, but it seems inevitable: a major shift in Christian history will occur. Christianity will gradually return to its original form, shedding layers of doctrine over time, as though turning back the clock, until only Jesus' initial message from God remains, before other thinkers added their ideas. As this trend spreads across the United States and Europe, leading many to worship as though in Jesus' time, focusing solely on his teachings, the church will remain strong to guide the way. However, because the theological clock will have been reset, the current diversity in Christianity will give way to more uniform beliefs and practices. Across regions and denominations, we will see increasing similarities rather than differences. History is filled with significant reversions. For instance, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, which later embraced Christianity. Similarly, our country has transitioned from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The upcoming significant reversion will occur within Christianity, reversing history to find its original source, and diminishing diversity in the process. This transformation will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus’ words metaphorically rather than literally. So what has happened since Jesus' lifetime? Tracing back in history, we find Judaism, the theological foundation of Christianity. By the time Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the revelation of divine religion, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures were central to the faith. The Jewish people were not unified, dividing into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of ordinary people.",
            "In my view, The Jungle illustrates the inherent greed and self-interest in human nature. People primarily focus on their own well-being and improving their lives, often ignoring those beneath them. This theme is evident throughout the novel, particularly in the actions of the factory owners and managers. Their sole aim is to expand and enhance their businesses, showing no concern for those affected by their pursuits. Upton Sinclair's narrative highlights this through vivid imagery: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair illustrates the environmental and social damage caused by pollution, showing the owners' disregard for the harm to people and animals. They are indifferent to the smoke and waste pollution from the factories and surrounding animal pens. \n\nMoreover, the owners and managers have little regard for the workers who enrich them. They exploit their workforce to maximize profits, creating an environment rife with jealousy and animosity, devoid of loyalty or decency. Employees are subjected to grueling hours and can be laid off en masse without notice, compensation, or assistance in finding new employment. During the period depicted in The Jungle, labor laws and worker protections were virtually non-existent, allowing employers to impose harsh conditions and demand faster work. Although the book doesn't explicitly state it, workers living and laboring in Packingtown were expected to endure the appalling conditions at work and in their communities. There were no agencies to support or inform workers, and while unions existed, they often exploited workers further. The employees were so poorly treated and trapped in the system that they resembled slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is one of Edgar Allan Poe's poems that he regarded highly. In this poem, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott links to Virgil. Virgil mentioned this term referring to an island north of Britain, considered by the Greeks as the boundary of the known world. While Virgil indeed used the term, there's a more contemporary influence worth noting. Poe had a keen interest in German authors. This interest is significant as it highlights Poe’s familiarity with Goethe’s work. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" notes the similarity between their poems, suggesting Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned author of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. In the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells of a king whose wife dies after gifting him a goblet. Grieving, the king drinks heavily and mourns his lost queen. Eventually, he decides to die, giving his possessions to his children except for the goblet. He walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and dies. The king’s demeanor and his portrayal in \"Dream-Land\" share similarities, perhaps reflecting Poe's own struggles with loss and drinking. \"Faust\" was also adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, shortly before Poe used the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" \n\nPoe mentions Thule twice in his collected works. He refers to \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and uses it twice as a framing device in \"Dream-Land.\" \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as complementary. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes Thule as dark and lonely, haunted by deceased friends, and perceives a colorless, shadowy world. These themes echo Goethe's \"The King of Thulé,\" where the king mourns his wife, feels isolated, and loses his will to rule or live. The poem feels as though the speaker walks into Goethe’s work. \n\nGoethe was a prominent author whom Poe would have known, not only due to his admiration for Tennyson. Poe expressed his respect for Tennyson, and this connection, along with the many reproductions of Goethe’s work after its initial publication, would have exposed Poe to Goethe’s influence.",
            "Under California law, can a customer who was injured after slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store receive punitive damages if it can be shown that the store manager acted with malice? This might be argued if the manager was informed twice about the spill but delayed cleaning it for half an hour due to having dinner. A judge is unlikely to immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive damages. To justify such a claim, the plaintiff needs to provide evidence that the defendant acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm their actions could cause, as well as prove that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have known about the potential harm of leaving a spill unattended, especially since there had been several slip-and-fall incidents at D&D in the months before her accident. Despite this, Martin did not address the spill. Although Palmer’s argument that Martin’s behavior was despicable is less convincing, it remains reasonable given that six similar incidents occurred in 2009 and Martin still did not take necessary safety measures.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin, on his dinner break, said he didn’t have time for customer complaints. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin of the spill, and his response was the same. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill and suffered a serious back injury. Before Palmer’s accident, five slip-and-fall incidents were reported at D&D in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages due to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can obtain punitive damages for breaching a non-contractual obligation if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice,\" according to Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or if not intended, the conduct must be \"despicable\" and done with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Courts have deemed conduct malicious when done with a conscious disregard for the plaintiff’s rights, especially when the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences and willfully failed to prevent them, as noted in Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "She always felt an unfulfilled longing, a need that started around the age of 14 as she entered her teenage years. Even at 17, she still experienced this yearning, realizing it was for someone rather than something. Despite this realization, she found herself uninterested in boys. Though some had tried, often awkwardly, to win her over, none captured her interest. She frequently pondered why she felt this way, considering various theories over the years but never finding a satisfactory explanation. She continued to live her life, persistently questioning her desires.\n\nMost days at home were peaceful, as her parents were calm, never quarreling with each other and rarely with her. The only disagreements arose from her expression of independence and free spirit. Despite having calm parents, she balanced their tranquility with her vibrant and fun personality, making her both likable and genuinely nice.\n\nHowever, today was different. As she moved through the house, seeking inspiration, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, her mother's beautiful voice. Rushing in, panic set in as she frantically asked, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mother lay on the floor, clearly in pain, repeatedly murmuring \"Ow\" in short breaths. Quickly, she knelt beside her mother to help. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital,\" her mother gasped. Her daughter recognized the urgency in her voice. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Following her mother's directions, she felt thankful for the strength she gained from her classes. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the back, and drove to the hospital.\n\nArriving at the hospital, she was too focused on her mother to notice the usual scents of disinfectant and fear. She swiftly carried her injured mother inside, urgently calling for medical assistance. Several concerned staff members gathered, quickly placing her mother on a rolling bed and taking her for immediate care, leaving her daughter to wait anxiously.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a step stool while trying to retrieve a vase from the highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a Mediterranean Diet, indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and mortality due to stroke. The aMed diet is a variation of the Mediterranean Diet, emphasizing increased consumption of plant-based foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (as opposed to saturated fats), and fish, while minimizing intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown a negative correlation between adherence to a Mediterranean Diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular mortality, with an intervention trial revealing that the Mediterranean Diet is more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in obese individuals. However, prior studies did not specifically address stroke or stroke-related mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who had no history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes and were part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. The authors calculated an aMed diet score six times between 1984 and 2004 using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) to evaluate nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of participants remained in the study for the entire 20-year period. The FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were corroborated through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. In cases lacking records, incidents were deemed \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions classified this way. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, and leisure-time physical activity was recorded starting in 1986.\n\nTo minimize random individual variation and better reflect long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated by averaging scores from two previous years. Adjustments were made for confounding factors, including age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe study used Cox proportional-hazard modeling to evaluate the relationship between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, reflected in a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a reduced risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, there were 2,391 new cases of CHD, 1,763 new cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combining fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.71.",
            "The sign reads, \"Hitler is alive in Burma,\" held by Ellen Page, the leading actress from Juno, as she stands alone on a street corner with the message scrawled in Sharpie on a piece of cardboard. Burma, or Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a repressive military junta that seized power through a coup in 1962. In 2007, Burma witnessed its first public demonstrations in a decade, known as \"The Saffron Revolution,\" led predominantly by Burmese monks, named after the color of their robes. Initially, the Burmese government reluctantly permitted the monks to gather peacefully, but the situation soon escalated into a violent confrontation between the monks and the military, with the military raiding monasteries nationwide. Foreign journalists were detained and jailed, and Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai was killed on September 27, 2007, during a street protest. The official death toll is recorded at 13, but Colonel Hla Win, an army defector, claimed, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThese occurrences are not new. Governments have long sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over their citizens. Roman emperors declared themselves divine rulers with total authority over their societies. Japanese emperors are considered deities, believed to lead their people to prosperity. Meanwhile, President George W. Bush reportedly has regular conference calls with Ted Haggard, head of Stupid People Worldwide, a group associated with the Republican Party.\n\nHistorically, notable examples of such actions include the Tiananmen Square protests on June 4, 1989, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students protested against the government’s authoritarian rule. The death toll from this event varies widely, with Chinese government reports claiming 200-300 deaths, while the Chinese Red Cross reported between 2,000 and 3,000 deaths. Another instance is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias, supported by the Rwandan government, systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates. Additionally, Hitler’s 'Third Reich' represents a period marked by the genocide of Jews across several years and countries.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting influence in jazz largely stems from his long career and his creative ability to shape his orchestra. While his piano presence is often understated in many of the works chosen for this assignment, as a composer, Ellington excelled in crafting intricate pieces that highlighted the unique talents of his band members. He designed frameworks that allowed soloists to improvise freely and composed tightly orchestrated sections that emphasized the distinctive styles of his musicians to bring out musical concepts. This approach also underscored the overall tone of the orchestra, creating cohesive and original sounds tailored to each composition. Ellington's skill in understanding both the individual sound of his players and how they blended in a growing ensemble enabled him to create some of the most innovative and remarkable works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, when discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, refers to \"Creole Love Call\" as an early example of his use of voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This piece illustrates Ellington's ability to add texture and color without relying on lyrics and showcases his talent for complementing his soloists' styles, evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues composition consists of six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Features a call and response between voice and reeds, starting with a smooth melodic voice that turns rougher towards the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo elaborates on the melody, highlighting several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register is supported by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band mirrors the first chorus with a call and response between brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus has the reeds initiating the call and response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: Returns to the structure of the first chorus, with a call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice uses the \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Concludes with a brief vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to enhance tone color in this piece exemplifies a stylistic trait that is pervasive in his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington combines tight orchestration with an ear for tone color. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing integrates the vocal qualities of Miley’s playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice, creating a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" builds on these ideas, as Ellington effectively utilizes Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a staple in his orchestra, to introduce the melody with a muted trombone.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the ways they do? Are there specific limitations or constraints that shape the course of evolutionary change? Although D’Arcy Thompson in 1917 remarked that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" this observation remains relevant today. More recently, mathematical modeling has been employed to explore general aspects of mollusk shell formation, both in the context of individual development and evolutionary history (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of changes during development and evolution in Prunum, coupled with experimental studies, can clarify the mechanisms that determine the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental change. We utilized X-ray images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that can be used to model both theoretical and actual shell shapes. These parameters were inputted into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We created models of theoretical shell shapes to explore the limits of possible morphological changes in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive research to gain a deeper understanding of major evolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be considered as a structure that forms a tube, revolving over time through 360 degrees of space. These revolutions, or turns of a coiled shell, are called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis. This axis runs through the shell's central column, known as the columella. The rate at which the whorls expand can differ, and a continuous line, called a suture, separates each whorl. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last one, known as the body whorl. The spire includes all whorls except the last. The spire's tip is the apex, while the opposite end is the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upward.)\n\nA method for counting whorls is described below. First, view the shell from the apical perspective and identify where the first suture begins. A line can then be drawn, dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line and estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a sequence of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. It is possible to trace the aperture's path using the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture, as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical formulation is established, it becomes possible to alter parameters and modify the mollusk's shell formation.",
            "For the past decade, Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have shown little change. Although the nation is progressing towards achieving many Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, the advancements in child and maternal health fall significantly short of the targets set for 2015. The underlying causes of these deficiencies, which will be elaborated upon below, indicate a necessity to enhance the health system instead of solely concentrating on specific program interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in the number of births attended by skilled health workers, reaching 72%. However, this statistic still includes traditional workers, like midwives, who cannot perform medical procedures in complicated pregnancies, contributing to the high rate of maternal deaths from hemorrhage. Thus, the progress in this area is somewhat deceptive, and substantial improvements are still required. Moreover, there has been a reduction in the percentage of children under five with diarrhea being treated by healthcare professionals. Although data on postnatal care is not comprehensive, it is evident that this is another area of concern, with low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain lower than expected, around 4%. These rates highlight another issue: the disparity in healthcare access. While urban areas have a c-section rate of 7%, rural areas only have a rate of 2%, illustrating the inequitable distribution of healthcare services. Additionally, there is a 27% gap in healthcare service usage between the poorest and richest segments of the population, indicating that the poor face significant barriers to accessing healthcare, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn considering steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, a fundamental question arises: how can the service gap be most effectively addressed? Should Indonesia focus on specific program interventions or strengthen the entire health system without concentrating exclusively on pre and postnatal care? While program-specific solutions offer clear, manageable goals and typically yield quicker results, they also have downsides. One major issue is that heavy investment in a particular health sector area can divert funds from other areas, drawing human resources towards the better-funded sector, as seen with international funding for HIV/AIDS impacting the family planning sector. Furthermore, running multiple concurrent programs for one area can lead to service duplication and lack of coordination, resulting in increased paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "The classification of popular music has expanded significantly over the last century, now encompassing so many genres that it's challenging to list them all comprehensively. Adding to this complexity, nearly every genre—like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—has generated numerous sub-genres and even more specific sub-sub-genres. Among these, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has arguably become one of the most varied and expressive forms of popular music over the past 40 years. It is considered expressive because it covers a broad spectrum of emotions, albeit generally on the darker side. Its diversity stems from the early realization of its inherent flexibility, which musicians quickly leveraged to create their own sub-genres, leading to further sub-sub-genres, a trend that continues today.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal scene has evolved to such an extent that the sheer number of niche groups makes it challenging to define what heavy metal truly is. It has absorbed a wide array of themes from other genres, yet it originated from a specific point. To properly comprehend the metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp what the metal movement represents and why it is considered a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nIn many respects, metal is a movement characterized by darkness. It can be described as \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatricality. It moves away from primitivism towards technical skill; members of metal bands are adept musicians, which is evident in their music. Additionally, metal is a movement significantly influenced by drugs, particularly following the psychedelic drug surge of the mid-70s, which led people to create extraordinary, otherworldly records, using drugs as inspiration. Metal's dark, visceral qualities were a novel addition to the music scene, contrasting with the lighter themes in much of popular music. Moreover, later generations of metal drew inspiration from the dark, visceral elements prevalent in the Romantic Era. Lyrics from songs like \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles highlight the darkness integral to this movement.\n\nThese lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" showcase the Beatles' darker side, reflecting the highs and lows associated with drugs. Some consider it among the first Heavy Metal songs, created in response to a similarly heavy and dark Rolling Stones song. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate that they could be as intense as the Stones, thus including the track on \"The White Album.\"",
            "Several decades prior to the emergence of Surrealist artists with their dream-inspired creations, Henri Rousseau was meticulously forming his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only portrays a woman marveling at the extraordinary landscape she encounters in a dream, but it also symbolizes Rousseau’s personal aspirations and ambitions as an artist. From the onset of his career, Rousseau yearned for recognition, acceptance, and acclaim from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet he faced a challenging internal conflict in pursuit of this goal. The Dream encapsulates Rousseau's persistent internal struggle throughout his career: whether to adhere to or imitate certain artistic styles to gain acceptance in the esteemed art world he greatly admired, or to embrace his creative independence and distinctiveness, forging his own path as he progressed.\n\nBefore delving into an analysis of The Dream through this lens, it is essential to be acquainted with Rousseau’s background. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who \"enjoyed bourgeois prosperity\" (Shattuck 47). He lacked formal artistic education and worked for the municipal toll service in France until the age of forty, although he was erroneously nicknamed a customs inspector, or douanier (Shattuck 46). The loss of his first wife, Clémence, after the deaths of their eight infant children, left Rousseau with a daughter named Julia and profound sorrow (Shattuck 49). Seeking solace and a fresh start, he turned to painting as a refuge. Unlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized peasants in their art, Rousseau was fundamentally a folk painter who embodied the aspirations and dreams of an average person from his social background.\n\nRousseau’s intense desire for acceptance in the art world is somewhat understandable in context: as noted, he was self-taught in formal painting techniques and commenced his artistic career later in life, while competing with numerous other skilled and more renowned modern artists. Despite years of work, it was not until the same period that Matisse began establishing his reputation as an artist that Rousseau started to gain proper recognition for his art. In the book Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes that although Rousseau and Matisse were rivals in the art scene, they differed not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations for painting: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).",
            "Many prominent thinkers have suggested a deep relationship between ethics and aesthetics, as well as truth and beauty. I believe there is a fundamental reason for this connection. As John Keats expresses in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we understand in life comes through education or experience. Yet, as Keats implies, we seem to grasp ethics and aesthetics naturally, without the need for formal teaching. Both fields strive to describe rather than dictate. Our exploration of morality and beauty largely involves explaining why a work of art or literature is beautiful or why an action is moral, rather than offering a set of rules for evaluating or creating good art or ethical behavior.\n\nFurthermore, critiques of art or morals never fully capture the essence of what is good or beautiful. For instance, discussions about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on aspects like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural significance, but these do not truly explain why it is considered great art. When asked about a favorite piece of art or literature, people often say, \"There's just something about it,\" before providing a more detailed or analytical explanation. I believe that both art and morals cannot be entirely reduced to descriptions of their attributes. As Flannery O'Connor states, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe the features of a literary work, there remains a transcendent quality. I think ethics shares this same characteristic. Wittgenstein noted, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that this \"something,\" this indescribable essence, is the most compelling aspect of art and morality, and that the transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics connects them.\n\nI believe morality and art are closely linked because we experience both most profoundly at a noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. They affect us in a way that can be felt but not fully explained. This connection is even more pronounced in the art of literature. As McKean observes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Modern Germany is seen as a powerful and unified nation, showcasing a unique cultural blend stretching from the Alps' shadows in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This culture is evident from Cologne on the Rhine, through central Germany, to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given this distinct culture, it's unsurprising that contemporary Germany has diverse origins and tribal influences.\n\nThe ancestral land of the Germans, known as Germania, has a name whose origins are debated among scholars and historians. Tacitus suggested that the name derived from a Germanic Tribe once called Tungrians, who were initially known as Germans before crossing the Rhine and clashing with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first introduced the term “Germanus” in his writings on the Gallic Wars, where he defeated the Gauls and fought Germanic tribes often crossing the Rhine with questionable intentions. He borrowed this term from the Gauls to distinguish between the conquered Gauls and the unconquered. Though the origin is unclear, some think it referred to a neighboring tribe in the Gaulish language. In the opening chapter of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar mentions: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC). Others suggest the meaning comes from the spear used in warfare, called a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout,” reflecting the Germans' loud nature (Names of Germany).\n\nIn AD 98, the Roman historian Tacitus, in his work “De Origine et situ Germanorum,” wrote about the Germans' origins, stating, “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98).\n\nAnd who would abandon Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, at least not yet. They would venture into Germania for goods and occasionally launch land campaigns but generally returned to their vast empire. As the Germanic tribes began to emerge in the middle of the first century, they settled on the Roman Empire's borders, trading goods from the land and serving in the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" suggests that while disguises can effectively sustain prolonged deception, ultimately, a person must abandon their assumed identity to avoid becoming lost in it indefinitely. The challenge in ending a deception lies in the potential for alienation. Thus, one must choose between preserving their own identity or maintaining their relationships with others. Some may react indifferently to discovering they have been deceived, but others might be offended by the entire ruse.\n\nThe theme of deception through gender role reversal is particularly complex, raising questions about the reasons behind adopting such a disguise. Why would someone feel the need to conceal their true identity by posing as the opposite gender? In Viola's situation, it is a means of self-protection: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). \n\nNewly arrived in a foreign land, Viola sees the need to masquerade as a man to safeguard herself from potential threats. While her strategy succeeds, it also isolates her from other women, depriving her of crucial support. Complicating matters, she is so convincing as a man that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Furthermore, Viola must contend with unspoken romantic feelings between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261).\n\nTo a modern audience, \"Twelfth Night\" might illustrate how deception can reveal hidden emotions, particularly for Olivia and Orsino. Some scenes imply that these characters may have unacknowledged desires that Viola/Cesario's presence compels them to confront. For example, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because she perceives him as a man, or does she secretly have feelings for women? One could argue this is unlikely, as Shakespeare's Olivia seems to parody those who judge others based solely on appearance. This is demonstrated by how easily Olivia shifts her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, ultimately viewing Cesario/Viola as family rather than a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German colonial rule is often characterized by its harshness, particularly with regard to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in what was then German South West Africa. However, it is too simplistic to describe an entire colonial empire with such a broad stroke. The German colonial empire exhibited a wide range of policies and governance styles across its diverse territories. Similarly, educational systems varied throughout the colonies. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a significant number of educated and literate Africans. German efforts in education in Kamerun and other colonies were commended by contemporaries. \n\nIn stark contrast, the situation in South West Africa (now Namibia) was different. Unlike East Africa, where the government was actively involved in establishing state schools and educating the local population, in South West Africa, the responsibility for native education was largely handed over to missionary societies with minimal government assistance. The government, however, concentrated resources on European education within the colony, setting up state schools and providing greater support and oversight for missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, even beyond German rule. While other German colonies had notable numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, the vast majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate. Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to the unique situation in South West Africa. This paper aims to deepen the discussion by identifying these factors, focusing on new research regarding the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is extensive literature specifically concerning education within the German colonial empire. Most of these works, written in German in the early twentieth century, were produced during or shortly after the German colonial period and primarily aimed to describe educational systems in these colonies. Later English-language studies broadened the discourse through comparative analyses of education in different German colonies and in-depth examinations of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant disparities among the educational systems in various colonies. Cohen's study, which directly addresses the topic of this paper, is notable for comparing the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa and discussing the factors responsible for their differences. Cohen points out that the large settler population in South West Africa accounts for many distinctive features of its educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany’s other colonies, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of it was arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans resided in South West Africa, compared to just 5,336 in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The United States and Mexico serve as an example of two countries once engulfed in a prolonged rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The pinnacle of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, acquiring Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Numerous other conflicts occurred between these nations, eventually diminishing just before World War I. The rivalry originated from clashes between Americans and Mexicans over significant issues such as religion, culture, traditions, and diverging material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31). \n\nThis situation is similar to many other countries experiencing enduring rivalries with neighboring nations. Countries that share borders often face conflicting interests, leading to rivalries. The United States and Mexico exemplify many longstanding rivalries between neighboring countries. David M. Pletcher (1977) mentions that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41). Indeed, both these nations are geographically close to the United States and have historically been rivals, while other Latin American countries have generally maintained positive relations with the United States.\n\nReligious differences caused a divide between the two nations, a challenge that has troubled many countries throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that “if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy” (p. 86). Unlike the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was partly ideological and partly about competing interests each nation considered essential, this conflict was rooted in religious preferences rather than political structures. This mistrust evolved from the historical animosity between the English and Spanish. Inheriting this distrust from their colonial predecessors posed a significant barrier to establishing friendly diplomatic relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identify 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry. Most of these disputes involved territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier challenges. Raids by bandits and outlaws on American border towns were a persistent issue until both the United States and Mexico enforced military control over their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). Schmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry between the two nations began to subside as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and eventually concluded when American ambitions shifted “from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p. 110) in the latter part of the 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly rendered disabled by an illness I never knew existed.\n\nAt that time, I worked as a nurse, a profession I chose because I craved the safety and security I lacked during my childhood. \"You'll always have work; people will always get sick,\" was the mantra that echoed through my adolescence and beyond. Although my dream was to become a scientist or journalist—or a mix of both—I opted for nursing.\n\nYet, there I was, 46 years old, single, with no significant savings, and unable to work. Even now, I am disabled, and after 15 years of relying on Social Security Disability, I have virtually nothing that is truly \"mine.\" I manage to get by, but each day is a struggle that threatens my sense of security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, except for one truth: I couldn't have survived all these years without the support of my family and a few good friends, no matter how resilient I was. When real disaster strikes, you don't feel very strong at all.\n\nMy point is that life will always present emergencies—both big and small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how diligently one prepares, some challenges are simply too overwhelming to tackle alone.\n\nI completely agree that in the U.S., we must stop relying solely on the government, whose system is clearly deteriorating. However, I would much prefer to see Americans regain trust in one another—learning to offer and request help—rather than each of us independently constructing fallout shelters in our backyards.\n\nConservatives in the U.S. often speak of the \"rugged individualism\" that built this nation, but in reality, what sustained our forefathers during tough times was not rugged individualism, but rather compassion, mutual respect, and resource sharing. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn’t succeed by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, plus plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in case of a biological attack. I own several flashlights, various batteries, plenty of candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and can preserve your own food, do it. It’s a great idea, as is a wood stove, provided you don’t live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he gave up worldly possessions and attained enlightenment, leading to the founding of Buddhism. The most traditional branch of this religion is Theravada Buddhism. Now approximately 2,500 years old, Buddhism today differs from its original form during Buddha's time. This evolution is evident, for example, in Sri Lanka, a Theravada Buddhist country, where the annual water-cutting ceremony takes place. Both monks and laypeople take part in this event, which holds religious importance, even though Buddha never mentioned such celebrations. These changes range from surface-level traditions to the fundamental beliefs of the religion. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community, both monks and lay followers, has had to adapt its doctrines, influenced by various external and internal, hostile and benign forces.\n\nSeveral key terms will be frequently used in this discussion. \"Internal\" refers to influences originating from members of the Buddhist community, regardless of their monastic status, while \"external\" pertains to influences from non-Buddhists. A \"hostile\" force is one that harms or intends to harm the Buddhist community, stemming from a negative view of Buddhism. A \"benign\" force neither aims to harm nor help, though it may inadvertently do so. These terms will be repeatedly referenced throughout the discussion.\n\nTo begin, it's crucial to explore the fundamental doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the \"triple gem\" of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma primarily consists of the Tripitaka, or the \"three baskets\" of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka includes the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Recognizing these concepts is essential to ending Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. With the end of Sansara, one also eliminates lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) upon reaching enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka provides rules for living. Laypeople adhere to five precepts: not to kill, not to lie, not to steal, not to engage in sexual misconduct, and not to consume intoxicants. Monks follow many more rules. The most essential doctrinal aspect is the four noble truths: first, the truth of Dukkha, that life is suffering; second, that attachment causes suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Culture is a crucial factor in any negotiation, as it can be understood by both what it encompasses and what it doesn't. Culture is not uniform or a single entity, nor is it a specific trait. Generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are overly simplistic and broad. While knowing cultural generalizations can be useful, it is more beneficial for a negotiator to grasp how the culture influences the negotiation context and how it might impact the discussions. When encountering a foreign culture, individuals often relate it to their own, leading to comparisons.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset may require exploring its history and acknowledging its biases. Instead of judging or trying to alter a culture, it is crucial to accept it as it is and operate within its confines, particularly in negotiations, especially when one has a weaker bargaining position. Similarly, showing respect for traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and advance the negotiation when a negotiator is on foreign ground.\n\nIt's also essential to recognize that culture extends beyond national or international boundaries. Companies within the same country often develop their own corporate culture. For example, a company might prioritize long working hours or a more flexible schedule. Corporate culture can be observed through employee dress codes, communication styles (direct or indirect), and hiring practices. Some companies promote philanthropy at all levels, while others limit it to \"company-approved\" charities or events. The differences in American corporate culture from one company to another (and even within regions or between urban and suburban areas) illustrate the diversity of thought within a societal culture. Some cultures may seem less stratified than American culture and appear more uniform to outsiders, but this similarity is merely an invitation to explore further.\n\nUnderstanding values is even more critical, as they explain the reasons behind a culture's behaviors. In cultures that value saving face or communal harmony, negotiators are unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superiors to succeed. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that prioritizes hard bargaining may not be eager to settle quickly. Considering these generalities is vital before entering negotiations. However, it is advantageous for a negotiator to also learn about their counterpart on a personal level to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "The phrase \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God,’\" originally appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and serves as the starting point for St. Anselm’s discussion on God's existence. This perspective is also shared by Thomas Aquinas, another author we will examine. Since both authors argue in favor of the same idea, and our task is to assess which argument is superior, we will assume for brevity's sake that both authors are correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God described in the Bible. Allowing for a different concept of God would prevent a proper comparison of their arguments, as both are essentially defending the same idea of God. However, while both authors present valid points, neither offers a comprehensive foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo explore this, we will first consider St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm emphasizes understanding through faith, suggesting that one can find evidence of God within oneself. He argues that because God exists in our understanding, we cannot truly imagine His nonexistence. Although his explanation can be complex and sometimes unclear, the central idea is that proof of God resides in one's mind. Anselm suggests that we don't need external evidence to find truth about God; the truth of God's existence can be discovered by examining what we inherently know to be true within ourselves. This acceptance of something without irrefutable empirical evidence is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas argues that God's existence can be demonstrated solely through reason and empirical evidence, without the need for faith. This approach is advantageous in evangelism, a key aspect of Christianity, as it allows for the conversion of new believers based on logic alone, without requiring them to accept something unproven. Aquinas presents five logical arguments to support God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each case, he essentially shows that the necessity of God is a logical conclusion. Just as knowing one puzzle piece is missing allows you to deduce its features and existence without seeing it, logic leads to the conclusion of God's existence.",
            "Numerous authors employ various methods to evoke specific emotions or attitudes in their readers regarding significant topics. Some of these methods are more impactful than others. In his novel, The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes several such techniques. Occasionally, Fitzgerald combines an adjective and a noun in an unconventional manner to create a particular atmosphere around a subject. At other times, he assigns meaning to a symbol and uses it for a similar purpose. He notably employs this latter technique with colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald develops meanings for colors, especially white/gray and red/pink, and later uses these meanings to evoke a specific feeling related to an important object.\n\nFor white/gray, Fitzgerald creates a meaning of uniformity, with white representing something slightly nicer and of higher class, and gray symbolizing something older and more faded. This meaning is established early in the novel through frequent use of these colors. Daisy and Jordan are often described as being “in white” (8)—indeed, many characters wear white: Nick dons “white flannels” (41) for Gatsby’s party, Tom wears a “white shirt” (36) when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). The only instance where white is not present is when Nick observes Gatsby’s party, where “the halls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these colors by applying them to ordinary, insignificant subjects: Nick commutes “down the white chasms of lower New York” (56), the names on Gatsby’s party guest list appear as “gray names” (61) on Nick’s timetable, and Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—symbolizing uniformity (28). He also describes ordinary people or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy shared a “white girlhood” (19), there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of ashes, the “Italian child” on the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established the meaning of white/gray, he uses these colors to indicate unimportance or uniformity in certain subjects. This use of color to convey meaning begins with Daisy. After a significant gap in the use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster,” leading readers to perceive Daisy as less of a character and more of a uniform element, something Gatsby desires (74). Fitzgerald further employs this technique around Daisy to suggest her as a uniform element, such as the “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is once more in a “white” (115) dress before the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County boasts a highly productive agricultural sector, largely due to its temperate and sunny weather. Crops commonly grown include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a strong demand for organic produce through community-supported agriculture in the San Diego region, with many local groups having extensive waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Moreover, numerous organic farms offer tours of their farming operations and provide opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. Such operations enable landowners to benefit from government programs while simultaneously enhancing habitats, allowing for recreational use, and creating avenues for farm tours and educational purposes, which can generate income.\n\nBy tapping into a potentially lucrative niche market, organic farming also promotes greater biodiversity among plants and wildlife, as it avoids the use of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming can incur higher costs than conventional farming. It demands more labor and management to control pests and weeds and to fertilize without chemicals, often resulting in greater losses compared to conventional methods. Small organic farms also lack the economies of scale that larger operations benefit from. Practices that are beneficial to wildlife but not necessarily related to organic farming can also increase labor costs, such as planting cover crops, rotating grazing strategically, removing invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create specific habitats like edge areas or open ground patches. Hence, there are various reasons why a landowner in this situation might seek financial assistance or expert advice to maximize profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land selected for this example is a 160-acre parcel near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It consists of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. It is situated in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which is still under review but currently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many species, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, are endangered, while others like burrowing owls are declining and may soon be listed.\n\nHistorically, Native Americans inhabited this area for countless centuries before it was later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This tract of land was part of an original homestead patent and likely used for grazing or wood production over the years.\n\nI chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to explore the options a small farmer might have to reduce costs and maintain wildlife-friendly practices. To model what farming on this land might achieve, I identified an organic farm in the same vicinity.",
            "There exists a strong connection between brothers; one that is unbreakable and permanent. This connection encompasses a range of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, among others. Brothers have a deep understanding of each other, more so than anyone else connected in this way, and they see a reflection of themselves in one another. The true nature of this bond becomes evident in critical situations, whether for better or worse. When these emotions surface, they come at a significant cost. Understanding the emotions that spring from this brotherly link involves dealing with the outcomes they produce. When a person can look into their brother's eyes and see their own reflection, they perceive themselves not as others do, but as they truly are. Their true character is revealed through their actions and the consequences that follow. In “The Scarlet Ibis,” two brothers delve into this theme and the turbulent emotions that come with it. Against a richly detailed backdrop, these two boys embark on an ultimately futile journey. In the climax, bitter disappointment meets intense pride, and only one brother survives. The theme is conveyed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, their interactions, and the narrator’s perspective, which communicates the protagonist's complex emotions and his perception of the world, both of which greatly influence his actions. The protagonist’s actions are driven by one main emotion: pride. From the moment he and his younger brother, Doodle, go out together, to their final, tragic outing, the protagonist harbors resentment toward Doodle. He had hoped for a brother to whom he could teach various skills, like \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp.\" He wanted a sibling who could be his companion in races to Horsehead Landing and someone to sit with at the top of the great pine behind the barn. However, due to Doodle’s frail heart, surviving was uncertain, and participating in strenuous physical activities was nearly impossible. The young protagonist’s dreams were shattered instantly, which was a significant disappointment. He even admits to feeling anger towards Doodle, once considering suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would contemplate such an act? Yet, his heart softened when Doodle smiled at him, a simple act that filled him with hope. This indicates that his resolve was not very strong — deep down, he had an innate love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex and inventive system for processing information. As technology evolved from rudimentary to sophisticated, so did the metaphors used to describe the brain. It was first likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, a book, and most recently, a computer. When studying the brain, remember that these metaphors have limitations and can lead to incorrect assumptions.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory organ input, which converts physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light photons into electrochemical signals. The brain's algorithms repeatedly transform this sensory information through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles basic information such as color, orientation, and edges—where color shifts abruptly over a short distance—to determine that a box is present. Top-down processing then uses decisions from earlier bottom-up steps to expedite recognition of the box. In this case, top-down processing might help identify the object as a black box instead of a box-shaped void in the white background.\n\nAfter a certain level of processing, an attention filter evaluates the signal's significance and determines which cognitive processes it should be accessible to. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you glance at your shoes, a healthy attention filter keeps you from noticing each one individually. Conversely, you might notice your name spoken even in a noisy room. There are multiple stages of processing, and attention repeatedly influences the results.\n\nBefore the brain can process information, it must be stored. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded, with specific encoding methods for each type of sensory input. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally (appearance of the printed word), phonemically (the sound of the word), or semantically (the meaning of the word). Once stored, information must be maintained. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which retains information for around 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons temporarily. Long-term memory is thought to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are several models for organizing knowledge in the brain, some based on how humans recall memories, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that nodes represent concepts, with links based on relatedness. For instance, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which could connect to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States was engulfed by a severe financial crisis. Unemployment soared, the housing market collapsed, and numerous major corporations in the country were left devastated. This recession continues today, prompting questions about its origins and prevention measures. Essentially, the crisis resulted from shortsighted and self-serving political decisions that compelled banks and firms to issue subprime loans within an underdeveloped and inadequate financial framework. Concurrently, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were urged to underwrite and repurpose these mortgages into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit default swaps (CDS). When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves, spreading the disarray to these repackaged mortgages and ultimately affecting the broader economy.\n\nThe financial crisis traces back to 1999 during President Clinton's era, as he sought to secure a second term by boosting his popularity. To achieve this, the Clinton administration eased lending restrictions, setting the stage for the subprime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes accurately predicted the potential consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As outlined earlier, and as Holmes predicted, reckless lending was bound to lead to economic collapse.\n\nNumerous factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the complex nature of mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years leading to the crisis, further entangling various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This overexposure made U.S. households and financial markets highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nThe housing bubble inevitably burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in these mortgage-backed securities at a loss. In 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts, representing about 30% of the nation's GDP. Ultimately, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at low prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to transform into commercial banks under stringent regulation. Fannie and Freddie amassed $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That part of your story where you spread your writer's wings and soar, impressing everyone with your captivating, even enchanting prose. Or perhaps it's the section where your readers drift off or hit the \"Back\" button while muttering curses under their breath. Dr. Merlin is known to shout at her screen when she encounters an overload of information, and not in an enjoyable way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy gentle readers are familiar with the basic writing advice, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself trapped in lengthy passages where nothing happens, or there's too much going on. Exposition is that little devil on your shoulder urging you to lay out the history to get to the exciting parts (not to be confused with the devil on the other shoulder encouraging the author to reveal every detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition involves telling the audience what occurred, often in straightforward prose. In films, exposition happens when one character dumps a load of information on another, reminiscent of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nAn illustration is needed. As you read a story, you're informed that the heroine met her beloved at a certain place and time, they wed in a grand manner, and her husband was murdered before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to unfold over two pages, with both having only two lines of dialogue each. You'd expect the author to explore the husband's character, showing through his speech and actions how much he loves his wife, and you'd also expect the heroine to demonstrate in various ways how his presence transformed and enriched her life (especially if the story later explicitly states this). A thorough introduction to the husband's character would engage you emotionally with his fate and provide insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, the depth of their bond, and hints about her thoughts and dreams reflected through his perspective, among other things. You would mourn his death with her, thus growing more connected to the heroine.\n\nIn summary, you'd expect more depth on the simple storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to add that depth. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, continues*) Sometimes, the temptation is to rush through certain elements. Maybe you're introducing a new character and know he used to be in the Air Force, is now the night manager of a gas station, was married twice, has no kids, enjoys fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was a live broadcast from NBC 4 on the morning of August 13, 2011. The main story covered a man named Shad Hostettler in Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife multiple times. Even though they didn't mention her name, they showed Hostettler's mug shot, portraying him as quite menacing. The report on this developing story lasted about two minutes, which I felt was appropriate given the circumstances. \n\nThe second story involved an early morning shooting victim, 18-year-old Travis Buyers, who was critically injured in the Sharon Woods area. At the time, there were no arrests or suspects, and the SWAT Team was investigating. This report was brief, and I suspect that might be because the victim was a black man or from a black neighborhood. I've noticed, over the years, that crimes involving minorities often receive less media attention compared to similar incidents involving white victims. \n\nAnother story discussed the discovery of a bullet hole in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details included the location of the suspected incident and that a .22 caliber rifle bullet was responsible. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the shooter. \n\nThe forecast for rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon was also mentioned. Temperatures were expected to stay in the mid to low 80s over the weekend. This segment was brief, likely intended as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in. \n\nThey also reported on a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus, describing the suspect as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie, approximately six feet tall and weighing around 150 pounds. I found it odd that they emphasized the suspect's race and skin tone so much. \n\nAnother segment covered Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin, involved in a conspiracy to distribute large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, instead of saying he was sentenced to 25 years in prison, they stated \"300 months,\" which seemed to be intended to sound harsher. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, which I didn't think was relevant to the story.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of security that aims to track the performance of an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund. However, unlike index funds, ETFs offer greater flexibility as they are traded like stocks on exchanges. ETFs allow investors to enjoy the diversification benefits of an index fund while also providing the advantages of individual stock ownership, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase as few as one share per transaction. Although these features are highly appealing, ETFs typically have much lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund. On the downside, trading ETFs incurs a commission fee, similar to stock trades. Another advantage of ETFs is the wide range of funds available. Despite these benefits being clearly outlined, it is wise for astute investors to assess whether the claimed benefits, such as diversification, truly exist and to what degree. For this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to evaluate if the advantages of owning a single ETF are comparable to possessing a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, and whether there might be better configurations of these stocks to achieve an optimal Sharpe ratio or return.  \nTo assess the ETF, we will focus on the top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's total assets, as including every holding would be impractical. The top 10 holdings and their asset percentages are listed below.  \nTo estimate how well these ten stocks represent the entire ETF IHF, we can use their current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate each stock's contribution to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consists solely of these 10 stocks in the proportions set by the ETF. The Beta and return calculations are provided in the chart below.  \nThe chart shows that a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings yields a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, translating to a 16% increase in returns. It also shows that the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the entire ETF. Based on these results, a portfolio comprising just the top 10 holdings could potentially offer higher returns with a lower beta. However, it's possible that the means of these two portfolios might not differ significantly from each other statistically.  \nTo determine if these portfolios are statistically different, we calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their combined standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Referring to Figure 17, there was a sharp decline in commuter log submissions during the project's third month, which was somewhat disheartening, and the reasons for this are unclear. The arrival of winter on a New England campus likely led to fewer people commuting by bicycle or on foot, contributing to the decrease. December also signifies the end of the fall semester when everyone is preoccupied with completing schoolwork and processing grades, possibly causing the commuter log to be overlooked. Additionally, December ushers in the busy holiday season and a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many do not need to come to campus. Classes resume for the spring semester in late January, which might explain the low number of logs for that month. However, this doesn't fully account for the low submissions in February. It is possible that projects of this nature experience an initial surge of enthusiasm that naturally wanes over time. To counter this trend, we initiated the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a focused campaign that successfully boosted log submissions for that month. Thus, one challenge was maintaining project momentum despite a natural decline in engagement, along with the specific issue of holiday and semester breaks in higher education. \n\nAnother challenge for this project, or any alternative commuting project, is the widespread preference for the freedom, independence, and flexibility that driving offers, which is deeply ingrained in our culture. Therefore, it is crucial to provide incentives for alternative commuting. We offered numerous prizes, such as gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see the impact of larger prizes on participation, such as a bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car, which might have helped address the dip in engagement. The nature of the prizes remained consistent throughout the project. If the prize value had increased over time, it might have helped. The gift cards seemed sufficient at the project's start, but announcing the addition of bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January might have boosted participation and engagement instead of seeing a decline.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films typically utilize creative editing to create illusions. My film analysis primarily focused on defining the stylistic elements of most trick films and investigating the unique features found in some of the later ones. Generally, trick films from the turn of the century are confined to a set, structured within a frontal proscenium, lack camera movement, use long and medium shots, and follow the one shot = one film principle. However, a few films from the early 1900s deviate from these norms by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA key characteristic shared by these films is their use of an indoor set framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary in its proscenium position, not following figures or objects. This style was prevalent in early cinema, influenced by theater and, in trick films, vaudeville and magic performances. A limitation of this stage setup is that characters in trick films generally move side-to-side, avoiding movement toward or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move horizontally. Even when they exit the frame, the camera remains still.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition also results in predominantly long shots, with medium shots being less common. Close-ups are absent from any of the Edison trick films. This mirrors the theater and vaudeville tradition, where audiences view the entire performance at once, framed by the stage. In early films, actors do not approach the camera from the middle distance, so close-ups are not used.\n\nMost early trick films adhere to the principle that one conceptual shot constitutes the entire film. This confines the duration of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. It also limits the narrative potential of the films, which mostly focus on brief vaudeville-style tricks like magic, disappearing acts, and transformations with minimal storytelling. However, in trick films, a single conceptual shot is not necessarily one physical shot. A \"shot\" may consist of several shots combined to create illusions of appearing or disappearing. For instance, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a close examination shows where the physical shot starts with Mary's \"head\" being removed, though to the viewer, the film appears as a single conceptual shot.",
            "Ian Watt, in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel,\" refers to the traditional \"Gothic Novel\" as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" highlighting its contradictory nature both in substance and name. The Gothic style has faced criticism and praise alike, with some accusing it of lacking depth while others celebrate its ability to evoke the 'terrible sublime,' as noted by Burke. Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" the first \"Gothic Novel,\" fused elements of \"ancient and modern\" romances to pioneer the proto-Gothic genre and develop a new literary form. Walpole incorporated \"old\" theatrical techniques and 'new' naturalistic imitations in 'modern' novels to craft what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre often incorporates elements from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. At the time \"The Castle of Otranto\" was published, \"gothic\" was used to describe a variety of peoples, styles, and epochs, often seen as outdated or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The blend of theatrical \"Gothic\" elements with the novel's format, which provides a more intimate glimpse into character psychology, has allowed the Gothic genre to endure, appearing both outdated and novel to readers far removed in time from its original creation.\n\nA key concept in Gothic novels is Chivalry. The medieval notion of chivalry, the training of a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Chivalry holds special significance for Gothic writers due to its representation of the quintessential knight—brave, honorable, and skilled—and the perceived absence of such ideals in society, particularly noted by Walpole. By incorporating chivalric ideals and behaviors, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, hinting at the Gothic genre's evolution towards Romanticism, and is used as a means to critique and potentially improve the present. While writing \"The Castle of Otranto,\" Walpole was amidst political turmoil and was concerned about the future. Immersed in politics and facing possibly unjust accusations, he might have believed that the morality and inherent \"goodness\" of people from the gothic era had been lost in contemporary society. This idea is evident in his characters, such as Frederic, who is portrayed with many chivalric qualities. Frederic is described as a prince who has endured hardship, been affected by tragedy, and is believed to have been killed by infidels. The depiction of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, introducing the Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the series of processes involved in moving goods from the point of customer order through stages of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution to the customer. This concept was introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who detailed the comprehensive process of planning, executing, and overseeing supply chain activities to meet customer needs effectively and efficiently. The supply chain is composed of six essential components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these components to deliver optimal customer service. \n\nProduction marks the initial phase of the supply chain process, serving as the backbone for the entire series of operations. This stage defines the timing, reasons, locations, and methods for production. Managers must understand customer preferences, which can be discerned by analyzing market trends. The market acts as a primary indicator of customer demand. Once managers understand this demand, they can determine which products to produce and in what quantities. Subsequently, they decide on the optimal production sites and facilities that will meet the required volume and quality, ensuring customer satisfaction. Following the selection of production locations, managers then concentrate on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. Production is a crucial step within the supply chain, and every detail must be meticulously planned to avoid costly errors in time and resources over the long term. For instance, when I worked at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores, both companies had detailed guides and processes for various business aspects, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. Such structured processes enable smooth operations and clarity in roles and expectations.\n\nThe second critical component in supply chain management is supply. Supply involves strategic decision-making to identify the essential capabilities of a facility, and it determines the development of outsourcing partnerships. A single product may have multiple production divisions, each with unique equipment, personnel, and expertise. Managers must evaluate which division best suits different product processes. Additionally, management might opt to outsource certain tasks to other companies. The primary motivation for outsourcing is to enhance velocity, which is the ability to deliver quality and flexibility while simultaneously reducing or maintaining low cost levels.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous detail and focus on the period's aristocracy. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, while considered Victorian, diverge from this tradition. Both novels incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, which are not typical of the era's literature, thereby enhancing the characters and offering deeper insights into their motivations and emotions.\n\n\"Now, a torrent of bewildering and confusing thoughts surged through his mind. He felt as if he was still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were fiercely arguing; their words echoed in his ears, and he realized he was talking to them himself. Suddenly, he jolted at the sound of gunshots; cries and shouts filled the air, lights flashed before his eyes, and noise and chaos surrounded him as an unseen force whisked him away. Amidst these swift visions, he felt a vague, uneasy sense of pain that constantly wearied and tormented him.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nThe two novels frequently use mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, with varying content and purpose in each case. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences often reveal insights into Oliver’s inner self, his suffering, and his awareness of the true nature of his surroundings. When the incident of Oliver being shot is revisited in chapter 28, he re-experiences the event vividly, as if in a dream, while struggling to seek help. This passage highlights Oliver's lack of control over the unfolding events and the precarious state of his health, emphasized by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms his senses; he doesn't notice the \"unseen hand\" that carries him away, reliving the despair detached from the initial shock since the pain has become constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. This overwhelming experience raises questions about who is responsible for his misfortune, as it is certainly not his own doing. The shooting underscores that Oliver has little control over anything, unable to even attempt to influence the outcome of events, even when his life is at stake. This passage implies a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if old Fagin is beginning to break him, pushing him to accept despair and diminishing his ability to react. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least to save his own life.\n\n\"The day passed – day! There was no day; it vanished as soon as it appeared – and night returned; a night so long, yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years back, I was involved in an after-school program where I tutored elementary students. I aimed to assist them in any subject they found challenging, although my expertise lay in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to help a young boy named Adrian, who was in the third or fourth grade and faced significant difficulties with reading. It struck me that there was an unusual issue; while he could pronounce some letters perfectly, others eluded him entirely. Despite his Latino heritage, Adrian spoke flawless English. We encountered several challenges until I met his mother while supervising a few students who didn’t attend a field trip. Adrian's mother spoke only Spanish, and with my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate. That’s when I realized Adrian's issue wasn’t reading itself but his unfamiliarity with the English alphabet. Although I'm unsure if this insight made a difference for him, I hope he is doing better now. \n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issue in schools, particularly in California, and to illustrate that it’s not always as evident as it seems. Even children who speak perfect English can face substantial challenges in reading. While I think everyone acknowledges the existence of this problem, the question remains: how do we address it? For Adrian, the solution was straightforward: English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children who are not fluent in English, the solution is more complicated. There's no single answer. A combination of dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes is essential.\n\nThe dual language system is an excellent concept, not just for Spanish-speaking students but for all children. Studies show that children in two-way bilingual education programs often outperform their peers academically. Despite fears that such programs waste resources and offer no benefit to most students, this is untrue. If these programs were standard rather than exceptions, all students would benefit. But how do we implement this? Requiring all teachers to be bilingual is impractical. Nevertheless, there's no reason we can't employ bilingual aides or tutors.",
            "From a young age, many of us are taught that there exists something greater than ourselves, something beyond our understanding. Some are taken to Sunday school to learn about it, others attend Temple, or look inward for answers. Many people easily embrace the religions passed down by their parents, while others completely reject them, believing there's nothing beyond their personal, self-centered world. We might adopt one belief system only to later change to another. Regardless of the path we take, we embark on a journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique views on spirituality. We seek a guiding light in the darkness to lead us out of the shadows and into the sunshine.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father answered when I asked him about his favorite bird. We sat on our front porch, listening to the rain drumming on the tin roof overhead while we shared cigarettes. The gutters channeled the rain down, overwhelming the plants by the porch. He gazed into the rain with a look that seemed both searching and remembering. Over the past months, he had become thinner, his clothes hanging loosely on his body, and his hair had thinned more than I recalled. He continued to look into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, scared, and unable to express to my father how much I would miss him, because speaking about it would make it all too real for us both. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer to his, and joined him in watching the rain fall on that June evening.\n\nMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation did not ease his suffering but prolonged his life a few months beyond what the doctors had predicted; the value of this extension, given his continued suffering, was unclear to me. I questioned what kind of God would allow this to happen. Alone at night, I offered no prayers. If God existed, I felt he had long stopped listening to me.\n\nI couldn’t bear to watch him transition from this life to the next, so I didn’t. I couldn’t watch the life that brought me into existence come to an end. I wanted to remember my father for how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew him better than anyone else, and I knew he wouldn’t want his only child to witness his death. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate for Republicanism. Although primarily an agriculturist, his profession and brief political career shaped him into a man known for his commitment and outspoken views on personal freedom and governance. His support for an agrarian system underpinned nearly all his governmental opinions. His effort to preserve and promote what he saw as the most noble profession influenced his perspectives on sovereignty, the Constitution, and even the judicial system.\n\nJohn Taylor believed the United States had a unique opportunity to establish an ideal system due to the absence of native traditions that might constrain the government's founders, enabling the creation of a self-governed society. He was a strong believer in the natural rights of individuals, emphasizing that these rights are interconnected, so if one is denied, all are compromised, reducing the value of those remaining. Thus, these rights should remain beyond governmental reach. He argued that what some termed the \"state of nature\" allowed those with physical strength and cunning intelligence to thrive, but in a civilization, this should not be the case.\n\nTo build this ideal society, Taylor believed a government must be established that considers the inherent good and evil within humans. He was firm in his views on dualistic morality, stating that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that protect private property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalism, believing that a government founded on good principles would operate fairly regardless of its leadership, which would inevitably be driven by greed and self-interest. He regarded self-interest as the driving force behind all human actions, considering it only evil when it resulted in societies that thrived at others' expense. A good government was essential to restrain man's natural evil, and even then, it needed close scrutiny to prevent the incorporation of harmful principles.\n\nLike many steadfast Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He desired a very limited Federal government, with no more rights or powers than those explicitly outlined in the Constitution. He recognized that an expansive Federal government would be costly and potentially despotic. However, he believed a simplistic, literal interpretation was dangerous, as it could easily become corrupt without considering the authors' intent. Furthermore, he viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind blankly processing the scene before me. With a detached, silent focus, my awareness observed without connecting the subject to any abstract ideas, analyzing the image in front of my eyes. Thoughts drifted into my mind and disappeared almost as quickly as they arrived. My consciousness functioned so smoothly and effortlessly that it felt as if I had no independent thoughts, just an active, fluid experience of what I was observing. \n\nOnce, following advice from an artist I collaborated with, I bought an art instruction book titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had wanted to learn to draw since I was six years old, and this book covers everything from understanding a pencil to how the brain interprets lines. One technique it teaches is to place a square frame around any image the artist wants to study, transforming a complex scene—like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room—into a simple, focused image of just the bowl of fruit on a plain surface. \n\nAt that moment, as I looked down at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't mentally apply that artist's frame. Overwhelmed and in awe, all I could do was stand and marvel. Picasso had his blue period, Monet adored greenery, and Italian Renaissance masters displayed a spectrum of colors. If I aspired to claim my perspective as Artistic, then before me lay the beginnings of my work, the inception of my story, Work in Brown. \n\nMy fingertips touched my chosen tool of artistry, muscles tensing and relaxing as my hand moved through space, my mind's intent taking shape in what could have been my most creative moment. Water swirled, serene and clear. Flakes of matter separated from the whole, carried away to oblivion. Muscles tightened and spasmed more anxiously on the second attempt as my hand struck the toilet handle again. The stubborn brown mass remained immobile, clinging to the toilet bottom like a slug.\n\nWith a mop held loosely in my hand, feet spaced a foot apart, and a green tie uncomfortably knotted around my neck, I frowned at the offensive bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the unlucky cleaners at Rite Aid. After a few more flushes and some tranquil, introspective moments, my hand reached for the toilet paper, wrapped it around itself until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing upright, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the toilet, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "Teenagers are losing their lives in car accidents, and several factors contribute to this alarming trend among the youngest drivers in America. According to the National Institutes of Health, one part of the issue is that the teen brain is not yet equipped to handle the dangers of driving. Additionally, lack of experience is a significant factor, leading not only to more fatal crashes but also to an increased rate of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and off-road incidents.  \nTeenagers also tend to have worse outcomes when they are driving with their peers—a common occurrence. Research from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has demonstrated a link between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents.  \nIn an effort to improve teen driver safety, California and other states have implemented temporary provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit other minors from being passengers.  \nHowever, I believe provisional licenses are merely temporary fixes. The core issue is that, as a group, the youngest drivers are statistically unable to manage the risks and responsibilities effectively. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman even suggests that 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license. His research, reported by USA Today, indicates a prevalent desire among those under 19-20 to engage in risk-taking for the thrill. Therefore, delaying driving until this thrill-seeking tendency diminishes seems logical. Continuing to grant licenses to young teens will likely result in ongoing fatal accidents, with the death toll expected to rise significantly in the coming years. By 2010, the children of Baby Boomers will be eligible to drive, adding millions of new teenage drivers to the roads.  \nAddressing this issue through legislation would be relatively straightforward. Schools could maintain driver’s education classes to start the learning process, but no one under 18 would be allowed to drive. A provisional permit could be issued before a full license, and a certain number of training hours would still be required. This number could be based on current state requirements (for instance, California mandates 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of adult-supervised practice). Since the concerning statistics for teen drivers emerge nationwide, a uniform, national law would be a sensible and effective way to protect teens across the country.  \nThe legislation I propose is not a new concept.",
            "This paper explores three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with a concise definition of the disorder, followed by an explanation of its diagnosis, highlighting common traits or \"red flags.\" The paper concludes with strategies for teachers in mainstream classrooms to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), pertains to how efficiently and effectively the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. Specifically, it involves the perceptual processing of sound information in the CNS and the neurobiological activity that supports this processing, leading to electrophysiological auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it is a disorder where the brain struggles to process auditory input accurately. Individuals with CAPD have normal hearing and are not considered \"hearing impaired\"; rather, the brain region responsible for interpreting sounds, such as distinguishing words or separating conversation from background noise, does not function as it typically should.\n\nThe earliest reference to what is now known as CAPD dates back to the mid-1950s, when it was referred to as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Researchers were studying children with communication disorders at that time. In 1954, the Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children, and by 1961, Kimura had introduced dichotic testing and developed a model to explain the physiology of the central auditory nervous system involved in dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 spurred further research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD can present in various ways: individuals may struggle to localize or hear sounds in space, have difficulty distinguishing between different \"acoustic events\" (sound occurrences), fail to recognize sound patterns, or be unable to detect changes in speech, such as sarcasm indicated by tone shifts. Subsequent sounds might block earlier ones, they might lack the ability to synthesize auditory clues into meaningful information to act upon, and they may struggle to identify the sequence of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, patients undergo \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,\" which may be administered by \"audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using various measures that evaluate auditory-related skills\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This process may involve questionnaires, surveys, and observation of how patients respond to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single tool or test consistently used with a high success rate for diagnosis, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Many tests involve presenting the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and asking them to differentiate certain elements, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to these signals.",
            "In choosing to study social work, my goal is to build a career with the Division of Family and Children Services to assist children who have suffered abuse or neglect, and to support families facing difficulties. The values I bring to the field of social work include service, respect, ethical behavior, a commitment to enhancing relationships among people, and a dedication to my own professional development to remain effective in my role. These values are not only essential for social workers but are also personally significant to me.\n\nI have always wanted to help others, though I was initially unsure of the exact career I wanted to pursue. During high school and college, I observed many people avoiding their problems or using less than ideal coping strategies. These experiences led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, still uncertain about my career path, I decided to take a break. One summer day, a friend introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy in her home, who was there to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he had contacted the police about his situation. I went to his parents' home to see if I could assist. I privately shared my concerns with the police, mentioning my recent Psychology degree. They asked me to speak with the parents, as the law offered no immediate solution for the teenager. In conversation, the parents appeared uneasy and made excuses about their son's \"manipulative\" behavior in seeking outside help for \"simple\" family disputes. This experience prompted me to seriously consider a career in social work to aid children facing family conflicts.\n\nAnother critical value in social work is social justice. As a society, we claim to value individuals and mourn those we lose. However, the societal concept of an \"individual\" often aligns more with old traditions than true uniqueness. If society truly values individuals, why do we strive to conform? I consider myself an individual and resist limiting myself to fit in with others. Throughout high school and college, I protested social injustice by expressing myself through unconventional hair colors, wearing clothes that reflected my personality, getting additional ear piercings, participating in GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and opposing racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. I am committed to social justice and will continue to stand against social injustices.",
            "This paper examines the Biological and Sociocultural models as they relate to insomnia. The Biological model emphasizes inherited genetic factors and medical health aspects, while the Sociocultural model considers environmental interactions and their relevance to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The review of insomnia explores these models and details each selected piece of research to better elucidate the models. The research and its conclusions are then critiqued to highlight their particular strengths and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary sleep disorders, those related to another mental disorder, or those linked to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, whereas those related to another mental disorder are associated with an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other sleep disorder categories may arise from medical issues or substance use. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves problems with obtaining or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia pertains to difficulties staying awake, both persisting for at least a month. Narcolepsy is characterized by cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. Dyssomnias focus on the initiation and maintenance of sleep, whereas Parasomnias relate to sleep disorders with behavioral or physiological anomalies. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders linked to another mental disorder involve sleep challenges due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily considers insomnia and, to some extent, primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders centers on genetic, heritable, and physiologically acquired aspects. Hypothalamic neurons containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. Research on mice demonstrated that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons play a crucial role in sleep/wake states. Activating the GABAA receptor induces sleep-promoting responses, and inhibiting its firing can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) was shown to increase sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that mouse models may be applicable to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or deficiency with this receptor might impair one's ability to achieve sufficient sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if this phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and any alteration to the receptor might naturally disrupt sleep, adversely affecting aspects of life such as education, career, and routine tasks requiring sustained attention.",
            "I have been studying here at University Park for nearly two and a half years, which amounts to four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many, myself included. During my freshman year, I lived in a dorm room in East Halls, which is about as far east as you can get on campus, aside from the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my dorm in Stuart Hall to classes in distant buildings like Willard, which is near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes, particularly in the often inclement weather of State College. An alum I spoke with, who isn't much older than me, mentioned that not long ago, East Halls used to be separated from the main campus by large areas of undeveloped land. Now, those areas have been developed with sports fields, large new buildings like the Creamery and a new health services building, and are surrounded by apartments. As the campus continues to grow, getting around becomes increasingly difficult. The best solution for improving mobility on a college campus is the bicycle. However, simply having bikes isn't enough; students need to use them, and the campus must be designed to accommodate cyclists.\n\nI recently spoke with a friend who has started biking again after several years, and he expressed surprise at why he ever stopped. “Bikes are fantastic,” he said, “for a while it wasn’t trendy to ride a bike, but it’s the most practical way to get around.” Besides being beneficial for health, biking is the most efficient mode of transportation. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical effort can take you over 30 miles. Like many other students, I now live off-campus, just as far from the campus center as some dorms. Buying a bike has been my best decision this year. I have classes in the Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. Biking can reduce that time to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. The only issue is that Pollock Road, the most direct route to the Thomas building from my home, isn’t always easy to navigate, whether you're biking or not. Walking has its merits too, but I’m too busy to walk everywhere. Without my bike, walking would be my sole reliable means of getting to class. Walking to Thomas daily would consume an extra 30-40 minutes of my time each day, totaling over two and a half hours weekly. Adding the time spent walking to other classes, appointments, and more, it’s more time than I can afford to lose.",
            "In \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley critiques the looming dangers posed by technology and the capitalist framework that supports it, by depicting a dystopian society. The inhabitants of this society prioritize community over individuality and are conditioned from birth to seek immediate gratification above everything else. These citizens are mere pawns in a vast scheme, bound to a single ideology as dictated by the World Controller. Analyzing the novel through a Marxist lens reveals Huxley's skepticism about the evolution of these systems. Marxist concepts such as homogeny and reification underscore the idea that Huxley's work comments on the pitfalls of the burgeoning economy of his era.\n\nCapitalism is satirized using the Marxist concept of false consciousness, which asserts that ordinary citizens are kept ignorant of their true economic relationships with other classes, as they focus primarily on personal gain. This is said to result from the ideological control of the proletariat and common workers, a point that is evident in the conditioning seen in \"Brave New World.\" The lower classes, like the Deltas and Gammas, lack genuine free will; their desire to consume and indulge is amplified through hypnopaedia, as orchestrated by the World Controller. Hegemony, where social classes are entirely dominated by a distinct group of individuals, is clearly at play. The lower classes are unaware of their manipulation, literally buying into an ideology that supports capitalism and consumerism. Though the upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, have the potential to recognize this manipulation, few, apart from characters like Bernard, challenge their roles. The interactions among social classes highlight the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" genuine relationships among different individuals are nonexistent. The novel seems to avoid giving depth to its characters, even among the main ones, possibly suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism strips humanity of free will and expression. Love and strong emotions are absent, with interactions remaining shallow. This is depicted through men's comments on women's physical traits and women's candid remarks about their experiences. Moreover, the complacency of each societal class with their place in the hierarchy reflects the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their complete adherence to their roles in the community is indicative of Marxist views on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their superiority as long as they continue to consume and conform.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I attended a course on Islam at CBC. A major topic of debate in the class was whether Islam is an aggressive religion. I believe this issue is even more pertinent now than ever. Reflecting on events since 9/11, I've noticed the mass media shift from a hostile perspective on Islam and extremists to an extreme tolerance for Islam in America. In 2001, it would have seemed unlikely for someone with the name Borac Obama, who has evident Muslim roots in his family, to run for president.\n\nThe Prophet's biography fascinates me because, based on my understanding of Muhammad's history, it seems to contradict his personality. From what I've learned, I assumed Muhammad converted people to Islam by force, conquering tribes and compelling them to adopt Islam. However, the biography portrays Muhammad as a misunderstood martyr who humbled himself before others, eventually attracting followers who recognized the 'truth' in his teachings.\n\nAdditionally, there are striking similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' attributed to Muhammad. Notably, he is said to have multiplied mutton and milk to feed more than forty men. This narrative style suggests the authors intended to depict Muhammad as a humble prophet who simply lived in truth and performed miracles, without needing to prove anything. I find this problematic because it undermines the miracles and life of Jesus Christ, as if credit for Jesus' life is being claimed through Muhammad.\n\nThe biography also contains numerous stories that seem to aim at providing evidence of 'witness' or people converting to Islam 'on their own.' However, many stories are from third-party perspectives, where the author recounts hearing from someone who heard from someone else, and so on. I disliked this approach because, although intended to validate the stories, it made them seem less credible and more dubious.\n\nWhat disturbs me most about the work is its attempts to glorify Muhammad as a godly figure who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. Yet, historical accounts contradict the portrayal of Muhammad as gentle and humble, and I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus during his lifetime were quickly left behind as Christian thought evolved after his death. Observing this historical trajectory broadly, we notice Christianity drifting further from its roots. In today's world, there is a growing awareness and a remarkable progressive trend. While some traditionalists persist and resist thinking beyond their learned teachings, they may not be influential enough to sway the majority. Among Christians, historical understanding will significantly increase in future years. There will be a widespread desire to separate doctrines that were later added to Christianity from the original intentions of its founder. This process may take decades or even centuries, but it seems inevitable: a major shift in Christian history will occur. Christianity will gradually return to its original form, shedding layers of doctrine over time, as though turning back the clock, until only Jesus' initial message from God remains, before other thinkers added their ideas. As this trend spreads across the United States and Europe, leading many to worship as though in Jesus' time, focusing solely on his teachings, the church will remain strong to guide the way. However, because the theological clock will have been reset, the current diversity in Christianity will give way to more uniform beliefs and practices. Across regions and denominations, we will see increasing similarities rather than differences. History is filled with significant reversions. For instance, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, which later embraced Christianity. Similarly, our country has transitioned from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The upcoming significant reversion will occur within Christianity, reversing history to find its original source, and diminishing diversity in the process. This transformation will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus’ words metaphorically rather than literally. So what has happened since Jesus' lifetime? Tracing back in history, we find Judaism, the theological foundation of Christianity. By the time Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the revelation of divine religion, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures were central to the faith. The Jewish people were not unified, dividing into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of ordinary people.",
            "In my view, The Jungle illustrates the inherent greed and self-interest in human nature. People primarily focus on their own well-being and improving their lives, often ignoring those beneath them. This theme is evident throughout the novel, particularly in the actions of the factory owners and managers. Their sole aim is to expand and enhance their businesses, showing no concern for those affected by their pursuits. Upton Sinclair's narrative highlights this through vivid imagery: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair illustrates the environmental and social damage caused by pollution, showing the owners' disregard for the harm to people and animals. They are indifferent to the smoke and waste pollution from the factories and surrounding animal pens. \n\nMoreover, the owners and managers have little regard for the workers who enrich them. They exploit their workforce to maximize profits, creating an environment rife with jealousy and animosity, devoid of loyalty or decency. Employees are subjected to grueling hours and can be laid off en masse without notice, compensation, or assistance in finding new employment. During the period depicted in The Jungle, labor laws and worker protections were virtually non-existent, allowing employers to impose harsh conditions and demand faster work. Although the book doesn't explicitly state it, workers living and laboring in Packingtown were expected to endure the appalling conditions at work and in their communities. There were no agencies to support or inform workers, and while unions existed, they often exploited workers further. The employees were so poorly treated and trapped in the system that they resembled slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is one of Edgar Allan Poe's poems that he regarded highly. In this poem, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott links to Virgil. Virgil mentioned this term referring to an island north of Britain, considered by the Greeks as the boundary of the known world. While Virgil indeed used the term, there's a more contemporary influence worth noting. Poe had a keen interest in German authors. This interest is significant as it highlights Poe’s familiarity with Goethe’s work. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" notes the similarity between their poems, suggesting Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned author of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. In the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells of a king whose wife dies after gifting him a goblet. Grieving, the king drinks heavily and mourns his lost queen. Eventually, he decides to die, giving his possessions to his children except for the goblet. He walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and dies. The king’s demeanor and his portrayal in \"Dream-Land\" share similarities, perhaps reflecting Poe's own struggles with loss and drinking. \"Faust\" was also adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, shortly before Poe used the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" \n\nPoe mentions Thule twice in his collected works. He refers to \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and uses it twice as a framing device in \"Dream-Land.\" \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as complementary. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes Thule as dark and lonely, haunted by deceased friends, and perceives a colorless, shadowy world. These themes echo Goethe's \"The King of Thulé,\" where the king mourns his wife, feels isolated, and loses his will to rule or live. The poem feels as though the speaker walks into Goethe’s work. \n\nGoethe was a prominent author whom Poe would have known, not only due to his admiration for Tennyson. Poe expressed his respect for Tennyson, and this connection, along with the many reproductions of Goethe’s work after its initial publication, would have exposed Poe to Goethe’s influence.",
            "Under California law, can a customer who was injured after slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store receive punitive damages if it can be shown that the store manager acted with malice? This might be argued if the manager was informed twice about the spill but delayed cleaning it for half an hour due to having dinner. A judge is unlikely to immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive damages. To justify such a claim, the plaintiff needs to provide evidence that the defendant acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm their actions could cause, as well as prove that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have known about the potential harm of leaving a spill unattended, especially since there had been several slip-and-fall incidents at D&D in the months before her accident. Despite this, Martin did not address the spill. Although Palmer’s argument that Martin’s behavior was despicable is less convincing, it remains reasonable given that six similar incidents occurred in 2009 and Martin still did not take necessary safety measures.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin, on his dinner break, said he didn’t have time for customer complaints. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin of the spill, and his response was the same. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill and suffered a serious back injury. Before Palmer’s accident, five slip-and-fall incidents were reported at D&D in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages due to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can obtain punitive damages for breaching a non-contractual obligation if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice,\" according to Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or if not intended, the conduct must be \"despicable\" and done with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Courts have deemed conduct malicious when done with a conscious disregard for the plaintiff’s rights, especially when the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences and willfully failed to prevent them, as noted in Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "She always felt an unfulfilled longing, a need that started around the age of 14 as she entered her teenage years. Even at 17, she still experienced this yearning, realizing it was for someone rather than something. Despite this realization, she found herself uninterested in boys. Though some had tried, often awkwardly, to win her over, none captured her interest. She frequently pondered why she felt this way, considering various theories over the years but never finding a satisfactory explanation. She continued to live her life, persistently questioning her desires.\n\nMost days at home were peaceful, as her parents were calm, never quarreling with each other and rarely with her. The only disagreements arose from her expression of independence and free spirit. Despite having calm parents, she balanced their tranquility with her vibrant and fun personality, making her both likable and genuinely nice.\n\nHowever, today was different. As she moved through the house, seeking inspiration, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, her mother's beautiful voice. Rushing in, panic set in as she frantically asked, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mother lay on the floor, clearly in pain, repeatedly murmuring \"Ow\" in short breaths. Quickly, she knelt beside her mother to help. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital,\" her mother gasped. Her daughter recognized the urgency in her voice. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Following her mother's directions, she felt thankful for the strength she gained from her classes. She carried her mother to the car, laid her in the back, and drove to the hospital.\n\nArriving at the hospital, she was too focused on her mother to notice the usual scents of disinfectant and fear. She swiftly carried her injured mother inside, urgently calling for medical assistance. Several concerned staff members gathered, quickly placing her mother on a rolling bed and taking her for immediate care, leaving her daughter to wait anxiously.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a step stool while trying to retrieve a vase from the highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a Mediterranean Diet, indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and mortality due to stroke. The aMed diet is a variation of the Mediterranean Diet, emphasizing increased consumption of plant-based foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (as opposed to saturated fats), and fish, while minimizing intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown a negative correlation between adherence to a Mediterranean Diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular mortality, with an intervention trial revealing that the Mediterranean Diet is more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in obese individuals. However, prior studies did not specifically address stroke or stroke-related mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who had no history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes and were part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. The authors calculated an aMed diet score six times between 1984 and 2004 using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) to evaluate nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of participants remained in the study for the entire 20-year period. The FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were corroborated through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. In cases lacking records, incidents were deemed \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions classified this way. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, and leisure-time physical activity was recorded starting in 1986.\n\nTo minimize random individual variation and better reflect long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated by averaging scores from two previous years. Adjustments were made for confounding factors, including age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe study used Cox proportional-hazard modeling to evaluate the relationship between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, reflected in a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a reduced risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, there were 2,391 new cases of CHD, 1,763 new cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combining fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.71.",
            "The sign reads, \"Hitler is alive in Burma,\" held by Ellen Page, the leading actress from Juno, as she stands alone on a street corner with the message scrawled in Sharpie on a piece of cardboard. Burma, or Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a repressive military junta that seized power through a coup in 1962. In 2007, Burma witnessed its first public demonstrations in a decade, known as \"The Saffron Revolution,\" led predominantly by Burmese monks, named after the color of their robes. Initially, the Burmese government reluctantly permitted the monks to gather peacefully, but the situation soon escalated into a violent confrontation between the monks and the military, with the military raiding monasteries nationwide. Foreign journalists were detained and jailed, and Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai was killed on September 27, 2007, during a street protest. The official death toll is recorded at 13, but Colonel Hla Win, an army defector, claimed, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThese occurrences are not new. Governments have long sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over their citizens. Roman emperors declared themselves divine rulers with total authority over their societies. Japanese emperors are considered deities, believed to lead their people to prosperity. Meanwhile, President George W. Bush reportedly has regular conference calls with Ted Haggard, head of Stupid People Worldwide, a group associated with the Republican Party.\n\nHistorically, notable examples of such actions include the Tiananmen Square protests on June 4, 1989, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students protested against the government’s authoritarian rule. The death toll from this event varies widely, with Chinese government reports claiming 200-300 deaths, while the Chinese Red Cross reported between 2,000 and 3,000 deaths. Another instance is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias, supported by the Rwandan government, systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates. Additionally, Hitler’s 'Third Reich' represents a period marked by the genocide of Jews across several years and countries.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting influence in jazz largely stems from his long career and his creative ability to shape his orchestra. While his piano presence is often understated in many of the works chosen for this assignment, as a composer, Ellington excelled in crafting intricate pieces that highlighted the unique talents of his band members. He designed frameworks that allowed soloists to improvise freely and composed tightly orchestrated sections that emphasized the distinctive styles of his musicians to bring out musical concepts. This approach also underscored the overall tone of the orchestra, creating cohesive and original sounds tailored to each composition. Ellington's skill in understanding both the individual sound of his players and how they blended in a growing ensemble enabled him to create some of the most innovative and remarkable works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, when discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, refers to \"Creole Love Call\" as an early example of his use of voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This piece illustrates Ellington's ability to add texture and color without relying on lyrics and showcases his talent for complementing his soloists' styles, evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues composition consists of six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Features a call and response between voice and reeds, starting with a smooth melodic voice that turns rougher towards the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo elaborates on the melody, highlighting several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register is supported by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band mirrors the first chorus with a call and response between brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus has the reeds initiating the call and response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: Returns to the structure of the first chorus, with a call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice uses the \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Concludes with a brief vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to enhance tone color in this piece exemplifies a stylistic trait that is pervasive in his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington combines tight orchestration with an ear for tone color. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing integrates the vocal qualities of Miley’s playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice, creating a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" builds on these ideas, as Ellington effectively utilizes Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a staple in his orchestra, to introduce the melody with a muted trombone.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the ways they do? Are there specific limitations or constraints that shape the course of evolutionary change? Although D’Arcy Thompson in 1917 remarked that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" this observation remains relevant today. More recently, mathematical modeling has been employed to explore general aspects of mollusk shell formation, both in the context of individual development and evolutionary history (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of changes during development and evolution in Prunum, coupled with experimental studies, can clarify the mechanisms that determine the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental change. We utilized X-ray images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that can be used to model both theoretical and actual shell shapes. These parameters were inputted into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We created models of theoretical shell shapes to explore the limits of possible morphological changes in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive research to gain a deeper understanding of major evolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be considered as a structure that forms a tube, revolving over time through 360 degrees of space. These revolutions, or turns of a coiled shell, are called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis. This axis runs through the shell's central column, known as the columella. The rate at which the whorls expand can differ, and a continuous line, called a suture, separates each whorl. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last one, known as the body whorl. The spire includes all whorls except the last. The spire's tip is the apex, while the opposite end is the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upward.)\n\nA method for counting whorls is described below. First, view the shell from the apical perspective and identify where the first suture begins. A line can then be drawn, dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line and estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a sequence of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. It is possible to trace the aperture's path using the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture, as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical formulation is established, it becomes possible to alter parameters and modify the mollusk's shell formation.",
            "For the past decade, Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have shown little change. Although the nation is progressing towards achieving many Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, the advancements in child and maternal health fall significantly short of the targets set for 2015. The underlying causes of these deficiencies, which will be elaborated upon below, indicate a necessity to enhance the health system instead of solely concentrating on specific program interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in the number of births attended by skilled health workers, reaching 72%. However, this statistic still includes traditional workers, like midwives, who cannot perform medical procedures in complicated pregnancies, contributing to the high rate of maternal deaths from hemorrhage. Thus, the progress in this area is somewhat deceptive, and substantial improvements are still required. Moreover, there has been a reduction in the percentage of children under five with diarrhea being treated by healthcare professionals. Although data on postnatal care is not comprehensive, it is evident that this is another area of concern, with low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain lower than expected, around 4%. These rates highlight another issue: the disparity in healthcare access. While urban areas have a c-section rate of 7%, rural areas only have a rate of 2%, illustrating the inequitable distribution of healthcare services. Additionally, there is a 27% gap in healthcare service usage between the poorest and richest segments of the population, indicating that the poor face significant barriers to accessing healthcare, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn considering steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, a fundamental question arises: how can the service gap be most effectively addressed? Should Indonesia focus on specific program interventions or strengthen the entire health system without concentrating exclusively on pre and postnatal care? While program-specific solutions offer clear, manageable goals and typically yield quicker results, they also have downsides. One major issue is that heavy investment in a particular health sector area can divert funds from other areas, drawing human resources towards the better-funded sector, as seen with international funding for HIV/AIDS impacting the family planning sector. Furthermore, running multiple concurrent programs for one area can lead to service duplication and lack of coordination, resulting in increased paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "The classification of popular music has expanded significantly over the last century, now encompassing so many genres that it's challenging to list them all comprehensively. Adding to this complexity, nearly every genre—like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—has generated numerous sub-genres and even more specific sub-sub-genres. Among these, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has arguably become one of the most varied and expressive forms of popular music over the past 40 years. It is considered expressive because it covers a broad spectrum of emotions, albeit generally on the darker side. Its diversity stems from the early realization of its inherent flexibility, which musicians quickly leveraged to create their own sub-genres, leading to further sub-sub-genres, a trend that continues today.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal scene has evolved to such an extent that the sheer number of niche groups makes it challenging to define what heavy metal truly is. It has absorbed a wide array of themes from other genres, yet it originated from a specific point. To properly comprehend the metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp what the metal movement represents and why it is considered a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nIn many respects, metal is a movement characterized by darkness. It can be described as \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatricality. It moves away from primitivism towards technical skill; members of metal bands are adept musicians, which is evident in their music. Additionally, metal is a movement significantly influenced by drugs, particularly following the psychedelic drug surge of the mid-70s, which led people to create extraordinary, otherworldly records, using drugs as inspiration. Metal's dark, visceral qualities were a novel addition to the music scene, contrasting with the lighter themes in much of popular music. Moreover, later generations of metal drew inspiration from the dark, visceral elements prevalent in the Romantic Era. Lyrics from songs like \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles highlight the darkness integral to this movement.\n\nThese lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" showcase the Beatles' darker side, reflecting the highs and lows associated with drugs. Some consider it among the first Heavy Metal songs, created in response to a similarly heavy and dark Rolling Stones song. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate that they could be as intense as the Stones, thus including the track on \"The White Album.\"",
            "Several decades prior to the emergence of Surrealist artists with their dream-inspired creations, Henri Rousseau was meticulously forming his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only portrays a woman marveling at the extraordinary landscape she encounters in a dream, but it also symbolizes Rousseau’s personal aspirations and ambitions as an artist. From the onset of his career, Rousseau yearned for recognition, acceptance, and acclaim from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet he faced a challenging internal conflict in pursuit of this goal. The Dream encapsulates Rousseau's persistent internal struggle throughout his career: whether to adhere to or imitate certain artistic styles to gain acceptance in the esteemed art world he greatly admired, or to embrace his creative independence and distinctiveness, forging his own path as he progressed.\n\nBefore delving into an analysis of The Dream through this lens, it is essential to be acquainted with Rousseau’s background. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who \"enjoyed bourgeois prosperity\" (Shattuck 47). He lacked formal artistic education and worked for the municipal toll service in France until the age of forty, although he was erroneously nicknamed a customs inspector, or douanier (Shattuck 46). The loss of his first wife, Clémence, after the deaths of their eight infant children, left Rousseau with a daughter named Julia and profound sorrow (Shattuck 49). Seeking solace and a fresh start, he turned to painting as a refuge. Unlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized peasants in their art, Rousseau was fundamentally a folk painter who embodied the aspirations and dreams of an average person from his social background.\n\nRousseau’s intense desire for acceptance in the art world is somewhat understandable in context: as noted, he was self-taught in formal painting techniques and commenced his artistic career later in life, while competing with numerous other skilled and more renowned modern artists. Despite years of work, it was not until the same period that Matisse began establishing his reputation as an artist that Rousseau started to gain proper recognition for his art. In the book Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes that although Rousseau and Matisse were rivals in the art scene, they differed not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations for painting: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).",
            "Many prominent thinkers have suggested a deep relationship between ethics and aesthetics, as well as truth and beauty. I believe there is a fundamental reason for this connection. As John Keats expresses in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we understand in life comes through education or experience. Yet, as Keats implies, we seem to grasp ethics and aesthetics naturally, without the need for formal teaching. Both fields strive to describe rather than dictate. Our exploration of morality and beauty largely involves explaining why a work of art or literature is beautiful or why an action is moral, rather than offering a set of rules for evaluating or creating good art or ethical behavior.\n\nFurthermore, critiques of art or morals never fully capture the essence of what is good or beautiful. For instance, discussions about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on aspects like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural significance, but these do not truly explain why it is considered great art. When asked about a favorite piece of art or literature, people often say, \"There's just something about it,\" before providing a more detailed or analytical explanation. I believe that both art and morals cannot be entirely reduced to descriptions of their attributes. As Flannery O'Connor states, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe the features of a literary work, there remains a transcendent quality. I think ethics shares this same characteristic. Wittgenstein noted, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that this \"something,\" this indescribable essence, is the most compelling aspect of art and morality, and that the transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics connects them.\n\nI believe morality and art are closely linked because we experience both most profoundly at a noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. They affect us in a way that can be felt but not fully explained. This connection is even more pronounced in the art of literature. As McKean observes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Modern Germany is seen as a powerful and unified nation, showcasing a unique cultural blend stretching from the Alps' shadows in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This culture is evident from Cologne on the Rhine, through central Germany, to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given this distinct culture, it's unsurprising that contemporary Germany has diverse origins and tribal influences.\n\nThe ancestral land of the Germans, known as Germania, has a name whose origins are debated among scholars and historians. Tacitus suggested that the name derived from a Germanic Tribe once called Tungrians, who were initially known as Germans before crossing the Rhine and clashing with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first introduced the term “Germanus” in his writings on the Gallic Wars, where he defeated the Gauls and fought Germanic tribes often crossing the Rhine with questionable intentions. He borrowed this term from the Gauls to distinguish between the conquered Gauls and the unconquered. Though the origin is unclear, some think it referred to a neighboring tribe in the Gaulish language. In the opening chapter of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar mentions: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC). Others suggest the meaning comes from the spear used in warfare, called a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout,” reflecting the Germans' loud nature (Names of Germany).\n\nIn AD 98, the Roman historian Tacitus, in his work “De Origine et situ Germanorum,” wrote about the Germans' origins, stating, “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98).\n\nAnd who would abandon Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, at least not yet. They would venture into Germania for goods and occasionally launch land campaigns but generally returned to their vast empire. As the Germanic tribes began to emerge in the middle of the first century, they settled on the Roman Empire's borders, trading goods from the land and serving in the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" suggests that while disguises can effectively sustain prolonged deception, ultimately, a person must abandon their assumed identity to avoid becoming lost in it indefinitely. The challenge in ending a deception lies in the potential for alienation. Thus, one must choose between preserving their own identity or maintaining their relationships with others. Some may react indifferently to discovering they have been deceived, but others might be offended by the entire ruse.\n\nThe theme of deception through gender role reversal is particularly complex, raising questions about the reasons behind adopting such a disguise. Why would someone feel the need to conceal their true identity by posing as the opposite gender? In Viola's situation, it is a means of self-protection: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). \n\nNewly arrived in a foreign land, Viola sees the need to masquerade as a man to safeguard herself from potential threats. While her strategy succeeds, it also isolates her from other women, depriving her of crucial support. Complicating matters, she is so convincing as a man that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Furthermore, Viola must contend with unspoken romantic feelings between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261).\n\nTo a modern audience, \"Twelfth Night\" might illustrate how deception can reveal hidden emotions, particularly for Olivia and Orsino. Some scenes imply that these characters may have unacknowledged desires that Viola/Cesario's presence compels them to confront. For example, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because she perceives him as a man, or does she secretly have feelings for women? One could argue this is unlikely, as Shakespeare's Olivia seems to parody those who judge others based solely on appearance. This is demonstrated by how easily Olivia shifts her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, ultimately viewing Cesario/Viola as family rather than a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German colonial rule is often characterized by its harshness, particularly with regard to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in what was then German South West Africa. However, it is too simplistic to describe an entire colonial empire with such a broad stroke. The German colonial empire exhibited a wide range of policies and governance styles across its diverse territories. Similarly, educational systems varied throughout the colonies. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a significant number of educated and literate Africans. German efforts in education in Kamerun and other colonies were commended by contemporaries. \n\nIn stark contrast, the situation in South West Africa (now Namibia) was different. Unlike East Africa, where the government was actively involved in establishing state schools and educating the local population, in South West Africa, the responsibility for native education was largely handed over to missionary societies with minimal government assistance. The government, however, concentrated resources on European education within the colony, setting up state schools and providing greater support and oversight for missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, even beyond German rule. While other German colonies had notable numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, the vast majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate. Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to the unique situation in South West Africa. This paper aims to deepen the discussion by identifying these factors, focusing on new research regarding the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is extensive literature specifically concerning education within the German colonial empire. Most of these works, written in German in the early twentieth century, were produced during or shortly after the German colonial period and primarily aimed to describe educational systems in these colonies. Later English-language studies broadened the discourse through comparative analyses of education in different German colonies and in-depth examinations of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant disparities among the educational systems in various colonies. Cohen's study, which directly addresses the topic of this paper, is notable for comparing the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa and discussing the factors responsible for their differences. Cohen points out that the large settler population in South West Africa accounts for many distinctive features of its educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany’s other colonies, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of it was arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans resided in South West Africa, compared to just 5,336 in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The United States and Mexico serve as an example of two countries once engulfed in a prolonged rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The pinnacle of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, acquiring Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Numerous other conflicts occurred between these nations, eventually diminishing just before World War I. The rivalry originated from clashes between Americans and Mexicans over significant issues such as religion, culture, traditions, and diverging material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31). \n\nThis situation is similar to many other countries experiencing enduring rivalries with neighboring nations. Countries that share borders often face conflicting interests, leading to rivalries. The United States and Mexico exemplify many longstanding rivalries between neighboring countries. David M. Pletcher (1977) mentions that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41). Indeed, both these nations are geographically close to the United States and have historically been rivals, while other Latin American countries have generally maintained positive relations with the United States.\n\nReligious differences caused a divide between the two nations, a challenge that has troubled many countries throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that “if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy” (p. 86). Unlike the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was partly ideological and partly about competing interests each nation considered essential, this conflict was rooted in religious preferences rather than political structures. This mistrust evolved from the historical animosity between the English and Spanish. Inheriting this distrust from their colonial predecessors posed a significant barrier to establishing friendly diplomatic relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identify 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry. Most of these disputes involved territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier challenges. Raids by bandits and outlaws on American border towns were a persistent issue until both the United States and Mexico enforced military control over their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). Schmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry between the two nations began to subside as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and eventually concluded when American ambitions shifted “from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p. 110) in the latter part of the 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly rendered disabled by an illness I never knew existed.\n\nAt that time, I worked as a nurse, a profession I chose because I craved the safety and security I lacked during my childhood. \"You'll always have work; people will always get sick,\" was the mantra that echoed through my adolescence and beyond. Although my dream was to become a scientist or journalist—or a mix of both—I opted for nursing.\n\nYet, there I was, 46 years old, single, with no significant savings, and unable to work. Even now, I am disabled, and after 15 years of relying on Social Security Disability, I have virtually nothing that is truly \"mine.\" I manage to get by, but each day is a struggle that threatens my sense of security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, except for one truth: I couldn't have survived all these years without the support of my family and a few good friends, no matter how resilient I was. When real disaster strikes, you don't feel very strong at all.\n\nMy point is that life will always present emergencies—both big and small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how diligently one prepares, some challenges are simply too overwhelming to tackle alone.\n\nI completely agree that in the U.S., we must stop relying solely on the government, whose system is clearly deteriorating. However, I would much prefer to see Americans regain trust in one another—learning to offer and request help—rather than each of us independently constructing fallout shelters in our backyards.\n\nConservatives in the U.S. often speak of the \"rugged individualism\" that built this nation, but in reality, what sustained our forefathers during tough times was not rugged individualism, but rather compassion, mutual respect, and resource sharing. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn’t succeed by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, plus plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in case of a biological attack. I own several flashlights, various batteries, plenty of candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and can preserve your own food, do it. It’s a great idea, as is a wood stove, provided you don’t live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he gave up worldly possessions and attained enlightenment, leading to the founding of Buddhism. The most traditional branch of this religion is Theravada Buddhism. Now approximately 2,500 years old, Buddhism today differs from its original form during Buddha's time. This evolution is evident, for example, in Sri Lanka, a Theravada Buddhist country, where the annual water-cutting ceremony takes place. Both monks and laypeople take part in this event, which holds religious importance, even though Buddha never mentioned such celebrations. These changes range from surface-level traditions to the fundamental beliefs of the religion. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community, both monks and lay followers, has had to adapt its doctrines, influenced by various external and internal, hostile and benign forces.\n\nSeveral key terms will be frequently used in this discussion. \"Internal\" refers to influences originating from members of the Buddhist community, regardless of their monastic status, while \"external\" pertains to influences from non-Buddhists. A \"hostile\" force is one that harms or intends to harm the Buddhist community, stemming from a negative view of Buddhism. A \"benign\" force neither aims to harm nor help, though it may inadvertently do so. These terms will be repeatedly referenced throughout the discussion.\n\nTo begin, it's crucial to explore the fundamental doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the \"triple gem\" of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma primarily consists of the Tripitaka, or the \"three baskets\" of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka includes the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Recognizing these concepts is essential to ending Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. With the end of Sansara, one also eliminates lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) upon reaching enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka provides rules for living. Laypeople adhere to five precepts: not to kill, not to lie, not to steal, not to engage in sexual misconduct, and not to consume intoxicants. Monks follow many more rules. The most essential doctrinal aspect is the four noble truths: first, the truth of Dukkha, that life is suffering; second, that attachment causes suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome."
