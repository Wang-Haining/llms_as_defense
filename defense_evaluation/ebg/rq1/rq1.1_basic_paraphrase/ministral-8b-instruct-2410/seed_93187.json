            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

The values I bring to the social work field are service, respect, ethical conduct, a commitment to strengthening relationships among individuals, and a dedication to continuous professional growth to stay competent. These values are not just essential for social workers; they are deeply important to me personally.\n\nMy desire to help others has been a constant throughout my life, but I was uncertain about the career path that would suit me best. Throughout high school and college, I observed many people avoiding their problems in denial and resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms. Witnessing these situations led me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Despite this, I was still uncertain about my career path, so I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009.\n\nOne summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy who was nervously sitting on her couch. She explained that he was there to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that the boy had contacted the police. I went to his parents' house to offer assistance. The police asked me to talk to the parents, and I saw that they were nervous and blamed their son for involving outsiders. This experience made me seriously consider a career in social work to help children with family disputes.\n\nSocial justice is another critical value in the field of social work.

            "This study explores the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to insomnia, addressing insomnia's biological aspects, which emphasize genetics and medical factors, and sociocultural aspects, which consider environmental influences like race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The review delves into these models, presenting and explaining the chosen research, and critiques their strengths and weaknesses. Insomnia can manifest as a primary disorder, a co-occurring mental disorder, or be related to medical conditions or substances. Primary sleep disorders are Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while those related to mental disorders are linked to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Dyssomnias involve problems with sleep initiation or maintenance, such as Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia. Parasomnias, like Nightmare Disorder or Sleepwalking Disorder, present with behavioral or physiological abnormalities. The review concentrates on insomnia and primary sleep disorders, focusing on both biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders centers on genetic factors, heritable traits, and physiological aspects. Orexin-expressing neurons in the hypothalamus regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that GABAB receptors on orexin neurons control sleep/wake states. The activation of GABAA receptors induces sleep, and their inhibition can reduce anxiety and promote sleep. The GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep duration in mice, suggesting that human sleep patterns might be influenced by this receptor. A dysfunction or absence of this receptor could impair sleep quality without medication. Socioculturally, if this phenotype is inherited, it could influence sleep regulation and negatively impact daily life, affecting areas like education, career, and tasks requiring sustained focus.",
            "This paper discusses three main aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Firstly, it offers a brief explanation of what the disorder entails. Second, it details the diagnostic process, including common indicators, or \"red flags\". Lastly, the paper concludes with strategies for teachers in mainstream classrooms to support students with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is defined as the efficiency and effectiveness with which the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. Specifically, CAP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory data within the CNS and the neurobiological activity that underpins this processing and generates electrophysiological auditory responses. Essentially, it is a condition where the brain struggles to process sounds as it should. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally, so they are not considered \"hearing impaired\"; instead, their brain's ability to interpret and distinguish sound, such as separating words or differentiating speech from background noise, is impaired.\n\nThe earliest reference to the disorder, originally called \"auditory imperception,\" dates back to the mid-1950s when researchers studied children with communication difficulties. This work led to the development of tests by the Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari in 1954, and the introduction of dichotic testing by Kimura in 1961, which formulated a model to explain the underlying physiology of the central nervous system in auditory perception. A significant national conference in 1977 further stimulated research on children with CAPD.\n\nThe symptoms of CAPD vary and can include difficulty in localizing sounds, distinguishing between multiple sounds, recognizing sound patterns, detecting changes in speech (such as sarcasm), being unable to filter out one sound when another is present, having trouble interpreting sound cues, and struggling to determine the sequence of auditory information.\n\nDiagnosis of CAPD involves a comprehensive evaluation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests that assess auditory function, which can be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals using various methods. These assessments may include questionnaires, observations of auditory behaviors, and responses to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single, universally effective diagnostic tool or known cause for the disorder. Common tests present patients with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and ask them to differentiate specific items such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to these signals.",
            "Twelfth Night suggests that while disguise can be beneficial for extended deceptions, ultimately, one must discard the assumed persona to prevent losing their true self. Discontinuing a deception can lead to isolation, as it may disrupt relationships. While some might react calmly upon discovering the deception, others could be offended, causing tension in their connections. The theme of deception in gender role reversal is particularly complex, as it raises questions about why individuals feel compelled to hide their identity. In Viola's case, her disguise as Cesario is a means of self-preservation. Arriving in a new land, she pretends to be a man to protect herself from potential threats, but this also separates her from female company, isolating her from a crucial support network. Her convincing portrayal of a man causes Olivia to fall in love with her, adding to her romantic complications. Shakespeare's characters, through their experiences with Cesario, may reveal latent emotions they had kept hidden. Olivia's transition from loving Cesario to seeing Viola as a sister suggests she was more judgmental of outward appearances than genuinely harboring feelings for women.",
            "The harshness of German colonial rule, evident in the genocides of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa, does not accurately represent the entirety of their colonial empire. German colonial rule varied vastly in its policies and administration across diverse geographical regions. Educational provision in these colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a significant population of educated and literate Africans. Similarly, the education initiatives in Kamerun and other colonies were commended by contemporary authors. In contrast, South West Africa (present-day Namibia) experienced a starkly different situation. Unlike in East Africa, where the government actively participated in the education of natives, in South West Africa, the responsibility for educating the natives was largely delegated to missionary societies with limited government support. However, the government did invest considerable resources in the education of Europeans, establishing a state school system and extensively supporting and regulating missionary schools. These policies had lasting effects on South West Africa, even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies boasted a substantial number of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to the unique experience of South West Africa. This paper aims to explore these factors and focus on new research into the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is a wealth of literature on education during the German colonial period, much of it in German and written in the early 20th century, during or immediately after the period of German colonial rule. Early works largely described the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later English writings expanded this discourse through comparative studies of education across various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects. These studies highlighted significant differences in educational systems among the colonies. Cohen’s study on education in South West Africa and East Africa is particularly notable. Cohen compares the educational systems of these two colonies and discusses the factors that account for their differences. According to Cohen, the substantial settler population in South West Africa contributes to the distinctive aspects of its educational system.\n\nCompared to other German colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately friendly climate, though much of its territory is arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected these mild conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, compared to only 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The evolution of popular music has seen an explosion in genres over the past century, making it challenging to enumerate them all. Each genre—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—has spawned numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. Among these, heavy metal rock has emerged as one of the most diverse and expressive genres within popular music over the past four decades. Its expressiveness is evident through a wide range of emotions, predominantly on the darker side. Its diversity is marked by the early recognition of the genre's flexibility, which led to the creation of various sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, with this pattern continuing to this day.\n\nToday, the heavy metal genre has evolved to encompass so many niches that defining it precisely is difficult. It has absorbed themes from other genres but has its roots somewhere. To comprehend the metal music prevalent today, one must first understand the essence of the metal movement—why it is considered a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is defined by its darker tones. It is often referred to as the \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more theatricality. Performers in metal bands exhibit advanced instrumental skills, which are evident in their music. Additionally, metal is often associated with the use of drugs, particularly during the psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70s. These substances were used to create otherworldly records, serving as a vehicle for artistic expression. The genre possesses dark, visceral qualities that were relatively new to the music scene, providing an emotional depth often lacking in popular music. Later generations of metal have drawn influence from the Romantic Era's darker and visceral qualities. Lyrics like those from Helter Skelter by The Beatles, which express the darker side of the band, illustrate this. The song was a response to The Rolling Stones' heavier and darker music and is considered one of the early heavy metal tracks.",
            "Before the Surrealists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was already crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. His 1910 painting, The Dream, is not only a depiction of a woman in awe of the wonders she encounters in her dream but also a reflection of Rousseau's own personal dreams and aspirations as an artist. Throughout his career, he dreamt of recognition, acceptance, and praise from other artists and art enthusiasts, facing an internal conflict between conforming to or mimicking established painting styles to gain acceptance or staying true to his unique creative vision. The Dream encapsulates this lifelong internal struggle.\n\nTo fully understand The Dream, we must first be aware of Rousseau's background. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval, northwest France, Rousseau's father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer. He received no formal art training but worked as a gabelou (employee of the municipal toll service), earning the nickname \"douanier\" (customs inspector) despite his lower-class background. After the deaths of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children, Rousseau turned to painting for comfort and a fresh start. Unlike his contemporaries, Rousseau did not idealize or romanticize the peasant in his art; he was a folk painter with the hopes and dreams of the common people.\n\nRousseau's desire for art-world acceptance is understandable given his context. Lacking formal training and starting his career late, he was producing works alongside prominent, better-known artists of his time. Recognition for his art began to come around the same time Matisse was building his reputation. Jan Gordon, in the book Modern French Painters, notes that while they were competitors, Matisse and Rousseau differed in their motivations: Matisse sought to avoid painting in a clichéd manner, while Rousseau yearned to paint in a conventional way to be accepted by the Artiste Français.",
            "Numerous great thinkers have posited an inherent link between ethics and aesthetics, as well as between truth and beauty. I contend that this is due to a fundamental reason. As John Keats observes in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty — That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of what we learn in life comes from education or experience, we often appreciate ethics and aesthetics without formal instruction, as Keats suggests. Both fields aim to describe rather than dictate. Our explorations of morality and beauty are primarily attempts to understand why a piece of art or literature is beautiful or why an action is moral, rather than definitive rules for evaluating or creating good art or moral behavior. Critiquing art or morality, however, often fails to fully capture what is truly good or beautiful. A discussion about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but ultimately, these don't explain why it's considered good art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often resort to phrases like \"there's just something about it\" before offering more detailed explanations. I believe that both art and morality cannot be fully reduced to descriptions of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor puts it, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” Similarly, ethics possesses this same ineffable quality. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I propose that this elusive 'something' — this je ne sais quoi — is art and morality's most potent attribute, and it is this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics that forges a connection between them. Moreover, I believe that morality and art are so interconnected because we experience them most vividly at a noumenal level, using a Kantian term. They impact us deeply, even if the reasons for this impact cannot be fully explained. This connection is even stronger when it comes to literary art. As McKean asserts, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values...Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Germany today is a powerful, unified nation, with a distinct culture that stretches from the alpine region around Munich to the Baltic Sea coast at Kiel, and from Cologne on the Rhine River to the heart of Germany, and on to the Saxon city of Dresden along the Elbe River. Given this rich cultural diversity, it's not surprising that Germany, as we know it today, is a blend of various origins and ethnic groups. The name \"Germany\" itself is of uncertain origin, with different theories suggesting it comes from the name of a Germanic tribe (the Tungrians), their use of spears, or the Old Irish word for \"shout\". Early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"On the Origin and Situation of the Germans\", described the Germans as an original, unmixed race who settled in Germany through seafaring, not immigration or mixing with other races. The Romans, while they did engage in trade and occasional campaigns in Germania, generally preferred to send their conquests there rather than themselves. As a result, the Germanic tribes living on the Roman Empire's borders traded goods and skills with the Romans, contributing to the development of what is now Germany.",
            "I gazed downwards, my mind blankly taking in the scene before me. I observed the object of study without emotion, my practiced awareness declining to connect it to any abstract understanding. Thoughts darted in and out of my mind so swiftly that it seemed I had no personal thoughts; instead, I was merely experiencing an active and fluid perception of what I was looking at. Once, following the advice of an artist I had worked with, I bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" My lifelong desire to learn to draw had driven me to this book, which teaches from understanding basic tools to the brain's processes in interpreting lines. One technique it taught was to place a square frame around any image to simplify it; for instance, a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room would become a simple bowl of fruit on a flat plane. At that moment, staring at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't imagine framing the scene. I was so overwhelmed and awestruck that I could only stand and marvel. Masters like Picasso (blue phase), Monet (greenery), and Italian Renaissance artists (rainbow of colors) had already set precedents for artistic perspective. Before me were the beginnings of my own work, the start of my story, \"Work in Brown.\" My fingers touched my chosen tool, my muscles tensing and relaxing as my hand moved through space, my mind giving form to the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled serenely and clearly, flakes of matter breaking away and disappearing. My hand struck the toilet handle again, more anxiously this time, but the offending brown package refused to budge, stuck like a slug. Grip on the mop tight, feet planted wide, a green tie uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter left as a message for bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet introspection, then my hand reached for the wall, gripped the end of the toilet paper, and began wrapping itself like an oven mitt. Standing upright, then bending at the waist, my hand slowly dipped into the bowl, like a mother preparing to retrieve a Thanksgiving turkey from the oven.",
            "Teenagers are perishing in car crashes. Multiple factors coalesce to make this a deadly trend for young American drivers. The National Institutes of Health reveal that a significant aspect of the issue is the immaturity of the teenage brain when it comes to driving dangers. Lack of experience further exacerbates the problem, leading to more fatal collisions, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and road departure incidents.\nTeens are especially vulnerable when driving with peers, which is common knowledge among those with any sense. Research by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center indicates that the age of passengers correlates with the frequency of traffic accidents.\nSeveral states, including California, have implemented temporary provisional licenses to mitigate teen driver safety, limiting driving hours and prohibiting other minors as passengers. However, these measures are insufficient as a group, as young drivers statistically struggle with the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman asserts that even at 18, teens are not ready for regular driver's licenses. Studies suggest that teens under 19-20 are inclined to take risks for the thrill, making it logical to delay driving until this tendency subsides. If we continue to grant driver's licenses to young teens, we will likely see an uptick in deadly accidents, potentially reaching alarming proportions as the current generation of teens becomes eligible to drive.\nA reasonable legislative approach would be to maintain driver's education classes in schools, blocking anyone under 18 from operating a vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued, with a required number of practical driver's training hours, based on current state standards (e.g., 6 hours in California). Since teen driving deaths are widespread, national legislation could effectively protect teens nationwide. This proposed legislation is not unprecedented.",
            "After browsing through the Library of Congress's archive of Edison's early films, I decided to watch all 15 trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films primarily use creative editing to create illusions. My analysis mainly involved describing the visual style of most trick films and exploring the unique characteristics of a few later films. Most trick films from this era are confined to a single set, using a frontal proscenium stage, with no camera movement, and feature long or medium shots, adhering to the rule that one shot equals one film. However, a few films at the start of the 20th century did break these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA common trait among these trick films is that they are shot within an interior set framed by a frontal proscenium, with the camera remaining stationary. This style, borrowed from theatre and vaudeville, limits movement to side-to-side within the frame, as seen in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). Actors enter from the side and move horizontally, never walking towards or away from the camera or having the camera follow them.\n\nLong and medium shots are common, with close-ups never being used in these trick films, reflecting the traditions of theatre and vaudeville where the entire performance was visible within the stage borders. This style also limits the dramatic or narrative potential of trick films, as they often focus on brief vaudeville-style tricks like magic or disappearing acts, with little story. Note that, despite the apparent single shot, a single \"shot\" in a trick film often consists of multiple physical shots edited together to create illusions. For instance, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a closer look reveals that the physical shot with Mary's \"severed head\" begins at a specific point, although the film is perceived as a single shot by the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate supporter of the Republican Party. His background as a farmer and brief political career shaped him into a champion of personal liberty and government reform. His deep commitment to an agrarian society informed much of his views on governance, sovereignty, and the judicial system. Taylor believed that the U.S. had the chance to establish an ideal government system due to the absence of native traditions that could hinder its creation. He held firm beliefs in the interdependence of natural rights, asserting that their denial would diminish the value of those that remain. In his view, a government should be designed to account for human nature's inherent good and evil. Taylor believed that good principles should protect private property, promote agriculture, and discourage capitalism. He thought that a government founded on such principles would function fairly regardless of its administration, which would be driven by avarice and self-interest. He also advocated for a strong, limited federal government with powers explicitly stated in the Constitution, as an extensive federal government could become corrupt and oppressive. Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defines the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, commuter log submissions sharply declined in the third month of the project. The reason behind this drop is unclear. In December, fewer people are commuting by bike or on foot due to winter, and students and faculty are busy with end-of-semester tasks and holiday preparations. The project's initial excitement might have also faded. To reignite participation, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which boosted log submissions. However, the project faced challenges, including holiday breaks and the general preference for driving. To encourage alternative commuting, we offered various prizes, such as gift cards to local businesses. Larger prizes like bicycles or hybrid/electric cars could have further increased engagement. Even increasing the value of the prizes over time might have helped maintain momentum.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a financial instrument designed to mimic an index, commodity, or a collection of assets, similar to an index fund, but with the added flexibility of trading like a stock on an exchange. ETFs offer the diversification of index funds and the advantages of individual stock ownership, such as short selling, margin purchases, and buying as few as one share. While these perks are appealing, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios than typical mutual funds. However, there are drawbacks, like the necessity of paying commissions on trades, similar to stock transactions. ETFs also offer a wide variety of funds, but it's crucial for savvy investors to assess whether these claimed benefits, like diversification, truly exist and to what extent.\n\nFor this analysis, we'll examine the ETF IHF and compare it with its top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of its assets. We'll determine if owning a single ETF can match the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of these 10 stocks, and whether there are better configurations of these stocks that could provide a higher Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo simplify the evaluation, we'll only include the top 10 holdings. We'll calculate the Beta and return of a portfolio composed of these 10 stocks, using their current asset proportions. The calculations are as follows:\n\nFrom these calculations, it's clear that a portfolio of the top 10 holdings could offer a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, with a 16% increase. Additionally, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF's. These findings suggest that a portfolio consisting of just these 10 stocks could yield a higher return with a lower Beta. However, we should also consider if these portfolios are statistically different.\n\nTo assess this, we'll determine the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% for comparison with the ETF IHF's standard deviation.",
            "Dream-land is considered one of Edgar Allan Poe's superior poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe employs the term \"Thule\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used this term to refer to an island north of Britain, considered the extremity of the known world by the Greeks. While Virgil did indeed use the term, another more contemporary source deserves credit, as Poe was particularly interested in German authors. This usage demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's work. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" highlights the similarities between their poems, concluding that Poe was imitating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was a renowned writer of the poetic drama Faust, published in two parts—the first in 1808 and the second upon his death in 1832. In the second part of Faust, there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" This poem describes a king whose wife's death after giving him a goblet leads him to drink heavily and mourn, eventually deciding to end his life by throwing the goblet into the ocean. The King of Thule's fate echoes the dark despair in \"Dream-Land,\" possibly reflecting Poe's own struggles with grief and addiction. Faust was also adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe refers to \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and uses the term \"Thule\" twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule as dark, lonely, and haunted by dead friends, resembling the state of the king in \"The King of Thule,\" who is also lonely and has lost his will to live. The entire poem reads as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe's world.\n\nGoethe was a significant author that Poe would have known, if only through his admiration for Tennyson. When asked if he admired Tennyson, Poe praised him and would have been exposed to Goethe's work through numerous reproductions following its original publication.",
            "In California, the injured customer, Jennifer Palmer, may be able to seek punitive damages if she can prove that the store manager, Paul Martin, acted with malicious intent. This would require showing that Martin knew or should have known about the potential harm of leaving the applesauce spill uncleaned for a half-hour, despite two employees having already reported it. Although Martin's actions were likely despicable, given the previous six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009, his failure to clean the spill might still warrant a punitive damage award.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, employee Rich Wayne informed Martin about the spill but was told that Martin was on dinner break and couldn't handle it. Another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, informed Martin at 5:15 pm, but again, Martin declined to address the spill. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, causing a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, there had been five similar incidents reported. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nUnder California law, punitive damages for a breach not arising from a contract can be awarded if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" If the defendant acted with ill intent to cause harm, or if their actions were despicable and willfully disregarded the safety of others, punitive damages may be justified. In this case, the court will examine whether to partially dismiss Palmer's punitive damage claim based on whether Martin's actions fit this definition.",
            "Four years ago, I enrolled in an Islam course at CBC, where the topic of whether Islam is an antagonistic religion sparked passionate debate. This question feels more pertinent today than ever. Reflecting on the post-9/11 period, I've noticed a shift in American mass media's portrayal of Islam and extremism, ranging from hostility to extreme tolerance. For instance, in 2001, a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, with apparent Muslim heritage, would have been unthinkable. The Prophet Muhammad's biography has always intrigued me, as it seems to contradict his historical portrayal. While I initially believed Muhammad forced conversions and conquered tribes, his biography depicts him as a martyr and humble figure, with converts drawn to his teachings. This portrayal shares uncanny similarities with Jesus' ministry and miracles, potentially diminishing Christ's life and miracles by attributing them to Muhammad. Furthermore, the biography relies heavily on third-party accounts, which can make the stories seem less credible. My main concern is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly, humble, and wise figure, despite historical evidence suggesting otherwise. If Muslims today knew Muhammad's true rise to power, I believe it would be challenging for them to maintain this image.",
            "The teachings and beliefs that Jesus held during his time were initially discarded in the evolution of Christian thought. If we examine this historical trajectory in a broad sense, a noticeable trend emerges: Christianity has been progressively diverging from its roots over time. Today's world is marked by an increasing awareness and a trend towards progressive ideas. While traditionalists persist and resist anything outside their learned beliefs, their influence may be limited. Among Christians, a growing historical awareness will lead to a desire to distinguish the doctrines added over time from the original intent behind Christianity. This process could take decades or even centuries, but the inevitable result will be a significant shift in Christian history. It will involve a movement that strips away layers of doctrine, as if reversing time, until only the core of Jesus' teachings remain. This trend, once it spreads across the United States and Europe, will lead to a widespread return to the worship practices and beliefs of Jesus' time. While the church as an institution will remain strong, the diversity within Christianity will decrease, with greater uniformity of belief and practice emerging. This reversal of history in the realm of Christianity is not unprecedented; after all, Christianity went from being persecuted by the Roman Empire to becoming a pillar of that empire. Similarly, our country has seen a shift from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The future will see a similar reversion in Christianity, undoing the diversity while returning to the source. A key factor in this process will be interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically rather than literally. To understand what happened after Jesus' lifetime, we need to look back to the roots of the Christian religion, which are found in Judaism. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., Judaism was characterized by monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures. However, the Jewish population at this time was not unified and was divided into various groups, including Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "Upton Sinclair's novel, The Jungle, illustrates the inherent greed and self-interest of human nature. People, by their very nature, are inclined to prioritize their own well-being and comfort, often disregarding those less fortunate. The novel demonstrates this through various aspects, particularly the factory owners and managers. Their sole objective is to expand their businesses and factories without regard for the consequences. They are indifferent to any harm caused to people or animals due to their operations. Sinclair vividly depicts the environmental destruction caused by pollution, describing the \"great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories\" and the \"river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". The workers are also subjected to harsh conditions, working long hours with little pay and no job security. The lack of worker protections or regulations during that era allowed managers and owners to exploit workers without consequence. The desperate conditions led to the formation of unions, but many were corrupt and exploited workers even further. The workers were effectively enslaved, working and living in appalling conditions, \"dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers\".",
            "Many authors employ various techniques to evoke specific impressions or attitudes in their readers' minds when addressing significant subjects. Some methods are more effective than others. In his novel The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald employs a range of these techniques. He often uses unusual adjective-noun pairings to create a certain atmosphere around a subject. Additionally, he invests symbols with meaning and employs them for the same purpose. Fitzgerald utilizes this approach with several colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald assigns special significance to white/gray and red/pink, building up their meanings and then using these meanings later to convey specific feelings about important objects.\n\nFitzgerald associates white with elegance and sophistication, while gray represents age and faded quality. He establishes this meaning with consistent use of these colors at the beginning of the novel. Daisy and Jordan are frequently “in white” (8), and most characters at Gatsby's party wear white: Nick is in “white flannels” (41), Tom wears a “white shirt” (36), and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). The only exception is when Nick observes Gatsby's party, where he describes the halls as “gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further reinforces these associations by applying white and gray to mundane subjects and people: Nick works in “white chasms” (56), party attendees have “gray names” (61), Catherine’s apartment is part of a “long white cake of apartment-houses” (28), Jordan and Daisy share a “white girlhood” (19), and there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of ashes. After imbuing white/gray with specific meanings, Fitzgerald uses them to convey feelings of unimportance or uniformity. The first instance of this is Daisy: after a long period without significant use of white or gray, she is described as “dressed in white” in a “little white roadster” (74), making her appear less distinct and more like a uniform desire for Gatsby. Fitzgerald employs this technique repeatedly around Daisy to emphasize her uniform nature. For example, her fur collar is described as a “gray haze” (18) and she wears a “white” dress (115) before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County's agricultural prowess is driven by its temperate, sunny climate, with crops like tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers thriving here. The demand for organic, locally grown produce is strong, with many community-supported agriculture initiatives boasting long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Some organic farms offer tours and recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching. This type of operation can leverage government programs to benefit both the environment and profits. Additionally, organic farming fosters greater biodiversity due to the absence of chemicals, but it also demands more labor and management to maintain yields. Furthermore, it can lack the scale efficiency of larger farms. Landowners might seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profits and habitat quality. The selected property is a 160-acre parcel in Potrero, unincorporated San Diego County, adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest, within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion. This area has a high concentration of endangered and declining species, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterflies, California gnatcatcher, and burrowing owls. Originally inhabited by Native Americans and later used for grazing and wood production, this land is now being considered for organic farming. Government programs and a nearby organic farm model were researched to explore potential cost mitigation and wildlife-friendly farming practices.",
            "Culture's impact on negotiations is substantial. Defined by what it is not, and what it signifies, culture isn't uniform or specific. Stereotypes like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are too broad and simplistic. A negotiator should focus on the cultural significance of the situation and how it influences discussions. When encountering a different culture, one naturally compares it to their own. Understanding foreign cultures involves studying history or recognizing biases, not judging or changing them. Acceptance and working within cultural boundaries are key, especially with a weaker bargaining position. Respect for traditions can help overcome cultural barriers and advance negotiations. Moreover, culture isn't limited to national identities; many companies have unique corporate cultures, evident in work hours, communication styles, and hiring practices. Some companies encourage employee philanthropy, while others limit it, highlighting the diversity within a society's culture. Cultural values, which drive behaviors, are crucial to understand. For instance, a culture valuing \"saving face\" makes public shaming unlikely, while a culture valuing hard bargains might delay settlements. Before negotiation, understanding cultural values and personal traits of opponents can enhance effectiveness.",
            "The fool has declared in their heart, 'There is no God.' This statement is initially presented in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and serves as the opening to St. Anselm's argument for the existence of God. It is also echoed by Thomas Aquinas. Since both arguments defend the same idea and we aim to compare them, we must assume they both genuinely believe in the existence of the biblical God. It would be impractical to consider any other divine entity for the purpose of this comparison. While both arguments present valid points, neither offers a comprehensive basis for believing in God.\n\nTo explore this, let's first look at St. Anselm's core argument. Anselm advocates for understanding God through faith, suggesting that proof of God's existence can be found within one's own mind. He argues that since God is a concept we can understand, we cannot logically deny his existence. Although his reasoning can be complex and unclear, his essence is that God's proof lies within our inherent self-knowledge. This is often termed 'faith' in Christian texts, where one accepts something without irrefutable empirical evidence.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, on the other hand, contends that God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, without requiring faith. This approach could be advantageous in spreading Christianity, as it would allow for conversion based on logic alone. Aquinas presents five logical arguments to support his view: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument essentially shows that the proof of God's existence lies in the logical necessity for such a being. If you have all but one piece of a puzzle, you can infer the existence and features of the missing piece by logical deduction.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a future figure known as the Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he renounced worldly desires and achieved enlightenment, giving rise to Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being its most traditional form. Now 2,500 years old, Buddhism has evolved significantly since the Buddha's time, particularly in Theravada countries like Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. Although Buddha didn't teach any religious festivities, this ceremony is observed by both monks and laypeople. The Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt and change its core beliefs due to both internal and external factors, ranging from friendly to hostile influences.\n\nThis discussion will frequently use the following terms: internal forces, which are driven by members of the Buddhist community regardless of their monastic status, and external forces, which originate from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community, while benign forces are neutral but may inadvertently assist or harm the community.\n\nFirst, let's examine the fundamental teachings of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists take refuge in the Three Jewels—the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, the teachings of the Buddha, is composed of the Tripitaka (Three Baskets) of scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Buddha's discourses, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the rules for monks and laypeople, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka explains Buddhist metaphysics, including concepts like Anatta (no self), Dukkha (suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these concepts allows one to escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and ultimately overcome desire (lobha), hatred (dosa), and delusion (moha) to achieve enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets out rules for both laypeople and monks, with laypeople following five precepts (not killing, not lying, not stealing, maintaining sexual purity, and avoiding intoxicants), while monks adhere to many more. The most crucial doctrinal tenet is the Four Noble Truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), suffering is caused by attachment, suffering can be ended, and the path to its cessation is the Middle Way.",
            "The United States and Mexico illustrate a historical rivalry that persisted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The peak of this rivalry was marked by the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States emerged victorious, acquiring Texas and the American Southwest. Various conflicts arose between the two nations throughout this period, subsiding before the onset of World War I. The rivalry stemmed from differences in religion, culture, tradition, and material interests (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31). This is not uncommon among neighboring nations that have enduring rivalries. While the United States shares geographical proximity and rivalries with Mexico and Cuba, other Latin American nations have maintained favorable relations with the United States. Religious differences, similar to those between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, were a significant factor in this rivalry. The historical distrust between the English and Spanish, inherited by their former colonies, posed significant challenges to establishing friendly relations. Diehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes during this 57-year period, most of which were territorial in nature, involving border raids and frontier issues. Schmitt (1974, p. 97) notes that the rivalry became less intense as Mexico increasingly depended on the United States, and it finally ended when American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the late 19th century (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was unexpectedly and severely disabled by a condition I had never heard of before. At the time, I was a nurse, a career choice driven by a deep need for security and stability, as I had lacked those growing up. The mantra \"There will always be work, and people will always need care\" was ingrained in me as I progressed through adolescence and into adulthood, despite my dream of becoming a scientist or journalist. However, at 46 years old, single, and with no financial savings, I was suddenly unable to work due to my disability. Now, 15 years later, I continue to live on Social Security Disability and have very little to call my own. Every day is a struggle, and my sense of security, safety, and self-esteem is constantly challenged. I've learned that while I may appear strong, true support comes from family and friends. Life's emergencies, both large and small, are inevitable, and no amount of preparation can overcome some challenges alone.\n\nI firmly believe that we, as a nation, need to stop relying solely on big government for help. While I agree with the need for self-reliance, I think we should also focus on rebuilding trust and mutual support within our communities. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies did not succeed by going it alone; they relied on cooperation and shared resources. So, while I encourage being prepared with disaster kits and supplies, I also urge you to build connections with your neighbors.",
            "The question remains: how and why do organisms evolve as they do? What constraints may influence the direction of evolutionary change? Although D'Arcy Thompson, in 1917, suggested that even the simplest organic forms are yet to be defined mathematically, recent advancements have applied mathematical modeling to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis, both in terms of ontogeny and phylogeny. Our study aims to use mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum, combined with experimental research, to understand the mechanisms behind the evolution of developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that can model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters were input into the CerioShell software. We modeled hypothetical shell forms to interpret the limits of possible morphological change in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better comprehend macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a spiral tube that evolves through 360 degrees of space. These spirals, or whorls, revolve around an imaginary central axis called the columella. The rate at which whorls expand can vary, and each whorl is separated by a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last one, known as the body whorl. The spire consists of all whorls except the last one. The top of the spire is called the apex, and the bottom is the base. The animal exits the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be examined from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. The typical orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, view the shell from the apical view and identify the first suture. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts. Count the whorls from this line, estimating a quarter whorl if necessary.\n\nShells can be considered a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal grows its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced using the coordinates of each whorl's aperture center and its horizontal and vertical radius.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical model is established, parameters can be varied to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have been relatively unchanged over the past decade. Although the nation is progressing towards achieving many Millennium Development Goals, especially in water and sanitation, the advancements in child and maternal health are insufficient to meet the 2015 targets. The reasons for these shortfalls will be explored below, indicating a need to bolster the overall health system rather than focusing on specific interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in the number of births attended by skilled health workers, reaching 72%. However, this figure still includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot provide medical interventions during complications, which is why maternal mortality due to hemorrhage remains high. This suggests that progress in this area is superficial, and there is still significant work to be done. Additionally, the percentage of children under five years old with diarrhea treated by a health professional has decreased, and postnatal care data is incomplete, indicating concerns in this area as well.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain low, at around 4%. This points to another issue: while urban areas have a c-section rate of 7%, rural areas have a rate of 2%. This disparity highlights inequities in healthcare access, with services concentrated in urban areas. Furthermore, vertical equity is a concern, as the richest and poorest quintiles differ significantly in service utilization, with a 27% gap. This disparity suggests that the poor have more difficulty accessing healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering ways to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is how to best address the lack of service. Should Indonesia focus on developing targeted program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system, without concentrating solely on pre- and post-pregnancy care? While programmatic approaches are appealing due to their targeted and manageable objectives and faster results, there are drawbacks to consider. One major concern is that investing heavily in specific health areas can lead to neglect in other sectors due to redirected funding and human resources. Moreover, running multiple parallel programs can result in service duplication, increased paperwork, and uncoordinated efforts.",
            "Victorian literature is known for its meticulous attention to detail and focus on the upper-class society of the time. Two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which incorporate mystery and the unusual into their narratives, enhancing character development and psychological depth. Both novels often use dream sequences or dreamlike states to convey this mystery, with each book employing it differently. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences provide insights into Oliver's inner turmoil, his awareness of his surroundings, and his pain. When he relives the shooting in chapter 28, it is as if in a dream, highlighting his loss of control over events and the dire state of his health. The shooting itself is overwhelming for Oliver, his senses numbed and his despair intensified. The passage suggests that Oliver's misfortunes are not of his own making, and he lacks control over his life's outcomes. His inability to react or take control reflects a growing sense of defeat, possibly due to the influence of Fagin.",
            "Two years back, I was part of an after-school program tutoring elementary-aged students. I did my best to assist them in whichever subject they were struggling with, although I excelled more in English and reading. I was approached by one of the instructors to help a young boy named Adrian, who was in third or fourth grade and having a lot of trouble reading. It soon became clear that something was off. He had peculiar issues with reading; he could pronounce some letters perfectly, while others he couldn't pronounce at all. Strangely, he was of Latino descent and spoke perfect English. We faced challenges until I met Adrian's mother. During a babysitting session (to keep the stragglers occupied), his mother walked in. She only spoke Spanish, and I, with my limited Spanish knowledge, communicated with her. It dawned on me: Adrian could read well; he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if this realization helped him, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, especially in California. It also demonstrates that the problem isn't always as apparent as we think. Even a child who speaks perfect English can struggle with reading. This is a known issue, so what's the solution? For Adrian, it was straightforward—tutoring in English reading, particularly the alphabet and pronunciation. But for many children who barely speak English, the solution is more complex. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. Combining various methods is key: dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—none alone will solve the problem.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is a valuable approach. It benefits not just children whose first language is Spanish, but all children. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. However, there's fear and misconception that it's a waste of resources and doesn't benefit the majority. This isn't accurate. If implemented as the norm rather than the exception, all children would benefit. But how do we make this happen? Requiring all teachers to be bilingual isn't realistic. Instead, we could have specialized aides or tutors who are bilingual.",
            "From childhood, many of us are introduced to the idea of something greater than ourselves, something we can't fully grasp. Some learn about this through religious instruction, while others seek answers within themselves or their families. Some readily accept these beliefs, while others reject them, claiming there's nothing beyond our own thoughts and experiences. We all have our own ways of exploring spirituality, searching for meaning and light in the darkness. \"A cardinal,\" my father said in response to my question about his favorite bird. We were sitting on our front porch, listening to the rain, smoking. He was thinner, his clothes loose, his hair thin. He gazed into the rain, almost lost in thought. I felt alone, scared, and unable to discuss my feelings with him. I hugged him, moved my chair closer, and looked out into the rain with him.\n\nMy father passed away in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The treatments had prolonged his suffering but not eased it. What was the purpose of enduring more pain and time? I wondered if God had stopped caring about me. I didn't pray. I couldn't bear to watch him die, so I stayed away. I wanted to remember him by his life, not his death. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for news. No one called me.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, as Ian Watt describes in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, essentially an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New',\" blending old and new elements. The Gothic genre has been both criticized and admired, described as having little depth and praised for its ability to evoke a 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The original Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, combined elements of old and modern romances to establish the proto-Gothic genre and a new method of storytelling. Walpole employed old theatrical elements and new representations of nature within modern novels to create what he termed \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre draws heavily from medieval Gothic theater, architecture, and traditions. Even in Walpole's time, the term \"Gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and time periods, often negatively, as archaic or unsophisticated compared to modern advancements. The fusion of traditional Gothic elements and the new, personal perspective of the novel contributed to Gothic's enduring popularity and its ability to seem both outdated and fresh to readers removed from the original time period.\n\nOne prominent theme in Gothic novels is chivalry, a medieval concept representing proper knightly training. In The Castle of Otranto, chivalry is both preserved and reimagined. Gothic authors, like Walpole, valued chivalry for its symbolism of bravery, honor, and competence, traits they felt were lacking in contemporary society. By incorporating chivalric elements and ideals, Walpole romanticized the \"gothic past\" and hinted at the future evolution towards Romanticism. Writing during a politically turbulent time, Walpole, amidst political turmoil and personal accusations, may have felt that the moral goodness and innate virtue of the Gothic era had been lost in modern society. This is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, including being a prince, suffering from tragedy, and being believed killed by infidels. His description exaggerates the trope of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves the series of steps for moving products from customer orders through raw materials, supply, production, and distribution to the final customer. The concept of supply chain management was introduced by Keith Oliver in 1982. It encompasses the planning, execution, and control of activities within the supply chain to meet customer needs swiftly and efficiently. Six key elements make up a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers employ these elements to deliver superior customer service.\n\nProduction is the initial step in the supply chain process. It is the cornerstone of the supply chain. Here, managers define the timing, purpose, location, and method of production. To understand customer needs, managers analyze the market as it is the primary indicator of customer demand. After assessing the market and understanding demand, managers decide which products to produce and in what quantities. They then choose the optimal location for production, considering volume and quality while ensuring customer satisfaction. Following this, managers focus on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. Production is crucial in the supply chain, requiring meticulous planning; neglecting details can lead to significant time and cost inefficiencies. For instance, companies like Wal-Mart and Target have detailed policies for every aspect of their operations, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments, ensuring smooth and confusion-free processes.\n\nThe second key element in supply chain management is supply. Supply involves strategic decisions about a facility's core capabilities and outsourcing relationships. A company might have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with unique equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must determine which division is best suited for each product's processes. Managers might also opt to outsource work to other companies, primarily to achieve quicker delivery times, improve flexibility, and reduce costs.",
            "A sign in Burma, which is also known as Myanmar, reads \"Hitler is alive.\" Ellen Page, the actor from the movie \"Juno,\" stands alone on a street corner holding a cardboard sign with this message written in Sharpie. Burma is a Southeast Asian country ruled by a military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, the country experienced street protests for the first time in a decade, led by monks, which earned the nickname \"The Saffron Revolution.\" The protests initially involved peaceful gatherings but escalated into violent conflicts between the monks and the government. The government cracked down on foreign journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai who was killed for being at a protest. The official death toll is 13, but a defected colonel suggests that many more people have been killed. This is not an isolated incident; similar atrocities have occurred throughout history, such as the Tiananmen Square protests, the Rwandan genocide, and Nazi Germany's persecution of Jews.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence on jazz music is largely due to his long career and his ability to direct his orchestra creatively. While Ellington's piano playing is often subtle in the compositions chosen for this assignment, he excelled as a composer in creating intricate pieces that highlighted the unique skills of his band members. He designed structures for soloists to improvise, wrote carefully orchestrated passages, and tailored his arrangements to suit each musician's style, fostering a cohesive and innovative sound. Ellington's mastery of individual players' voices and their collective ensemble sound enabled him to produce many groundbreaking jazz pieces.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary describes Ellington's sound and innovation, mentioning \"Creole Love Call\" as a notable example. In this piece, Ellington uses the voice as a jazz instrument to add texture and color. This technique, seen throughout his career, is exemplified in \"Creole Love Call,\" where the voice transitions between smooth and rough sounds and interacts with reeds, brass, and other instruments in a structured call-and-response pattern. The piece features six choruses, each with distinct solos and arrangements, showcasing Ellington's ability to complement his soloists' styles.\n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington demonstrates his skill in tight orchestration and tonal versatility. A call-and-response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing combines vocal elements of Miley's playing with instrumental qualities of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" builds on these ideas, as Ellington effectively uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone to introduce the melody, further emphasizing his approach to tone color and orchestration.",
            "She had always felt a persistent longing for something, a desire that remained unfulfilled. This sensation began when she was 14, around the time she entered her teenage years, and continued into her 17th year. By then, she had decided she wanted a person rather than an object, but no boy caught her interest. Several had shown attraction, attempted to woo her, but none seemed appealing. She often wondered about this peculiar situation, trying to understand what could cause such a reaction in a teenage girl. After years of contemplating, she had no satisfying theories. Despite her internal questioning, she lived her life, continuing to ponder her desires.\n\nA day at home was typically peaceful, with her parents being gentle and calm, rarely arguing. They only disagreed when she asserted her independence and lively personality. She was the daughter of a serene couple, but her vibrant nature made her well-liked. However, today was not peaceful. As she moved from room to room in search of inspiration, she heard her mother scream in the kitchen. Rushing in, she found her mother on the floor, in pain, and instructed her to take her to the hospital. Her daughter swiftly helped her mother into the car and drove her to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was filled with the smell of disinfectant and sickness, but her mind was focused on helping her mother. She quickly found help for her mother, who had fallen off a step stool trying to reach a high cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", is linked to a reduced risk of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, and a lower risk of dying from stroke. The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet, emphasizing more plant-based foods such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, and replacing saturated fats with monounsaturated fats and fish. It also allows for moderate alcohol consumption. Previous studies have shown that following the Med diet is associated with a lower risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, and trials have found it more effective than a low-fat diet for weight loss and improving cholesterol levels in overweight individuals. However, prior research did not focus specifically on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, without a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. Over six periods from 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score based on self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) that assessed nutrient intake over the previous year. More than 95% of nurses continued participating throughout the 20-year period. FFQ data was validated. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. Cases without available records were classified as \"probable\" and included, representing about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of postmenopausal hormones were also considered, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo account for individual variability and represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed scores from repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for potential confounding factors such as age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the association between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke was assessed, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a decreased risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (including fatal CHD and strokes) were recorded. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a severe financial collapse. There was a surge in unemployment, a crack in the housing market, and many of the country's major corporations found themselves in ruins. This economic downturn continues to this day, necessitating questions about its origins and how to prevent such an event from happening again. In essence, the crisis was engineered by self-centered and naive political decisions that coerced banks and corporations into offering sub-prime loans to an ill-prepared and insufficient financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to back and repackage these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted, banks found themselves short on capital reserves and passed the chaos onto the repackaged mortgages, which in turn affected the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of the financial crisis were planted in 1999, during the Clinton administration's pursuit of a second term. To boost his popularity, Clinton eased lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times warned in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, faced increasing pressure from the Clinton administration to broaden mortgages to low- and moderate-income individuals, and from shareholders to maintain profit growth.\" He foresaw the inevitable consequences: \"However, the government-sponsored corporation might struggle in an economic downturn, potentially requiring a government bailout like the one for the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" This foreshadowed the repercussions of the imprudent lending practices.\n\nMultiple factors conspired to send the economy into a spin. Among them was the new, complex mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely utilized in the years preceding the crisis, further interlinking various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This increased households' and financial markets' exposure to the housing market, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nThe housing bubble burst, leaving financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities in distress. In 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, representing around 30% of the U.S. GDP. Consequently, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dissolved, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to convert into commercial banks under strict regulation. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Exposition in storytelling can be both a joy and a burden. It's where you flex your writing muscles, captivating readers with powerful, spellbinding prose. However, it can also be the part of your story that sends readers to sleep or prompts them to hit the \"Back\" button. Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her screen when she encounters \"Too Much Information\" that isn't engaging.\n\nExposition, while a crucial part of storytelling, is often a challenge. The common adage \"Show, don't tell\" rings true, yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself falling into lengthy passages that lack action or, worse, provide excessive detail. Essentially, exposition is the voice in your head urging you to share background information quickly to move the story forward.\n\nIn literature, exposition involves relaying past events in straightforward language. In movies, it typically occurs when one character explains a significant chunk of information to another. The author, in this case, is the one doing the telling.\n\nConsider this example: While reading a story, you find out that the protagonist met her love interest at a specific time and place, they got married in a grand ceremony, and her spouse was killed in front of her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire backstory to be told over two pages with only a few lines of dialogue between the couple. You'd expect the author to delve into the husband's character, demonstrating his deep love for his wife through his words and actions. Similarly, you'd expect the heroine to show how her husband's presence enriched her life, providing insights into her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams. This detailed introduction would help you emotionally connect with the husband's fate and understand the heroine's character better.\n\nIn essence, you must provide substance to the skeleton of your story, such as \"They met, they married, he died.\" As a writer, you must resist the urge to rush through these details. It's tempting to quickly introduce a new character with a mundane list of facts, like being in the Air Force, running a gas station, having a certain dietary preference, or secret dreams. Instead, weave these details into the narrative to create a compelling character profile.",
            "I caught two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, which was live this morning (August 13, 2011), was from NBC 4. The headline story featured a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife (they didn't mention her name). He was arrested, and they showed his mug shot, which was quite disturbing. The story only received about two minutes of coverage, which seemed appropriate given it was still developing. The next story was about an 18-year-old man named Travis Buyers who was shot in the Sharon Woods area and critically injured. There were no arrests at the time, and the SWAT team was investigating. This story seemed brief, and I believe that might be due to the fact that Buyers is a minority. I've noted this trend over the years: minority victims of crime often receive less media attention than white victims. The next story discussed a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, which was determined to be a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest. Another news item was about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus, where a dark-skinned black man in a hoodie sweatshirt was reported to have robbed the store. The coverage seemed to emphasize his race and physical description more than usual. The final story was about a convicted Texas drug kingpin, Rene Rodriguez, who had been sentenced to 300 months (or 25 years) in prison for conspiring to distribute marijuana. They also mentioned his Hispanic background, which I didn't find particularly relevant to the story.",
            "There exists an unyielding, indissoluble bond between brothers. This bond is a complex web of feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, among others. Brothers comprehend each other on a level no one else can, and they see themselves reflected in their sibling. In times of crisis, the essence of this bond becomes apparent, whether it manifests positively or negatively. When these emotions surface, they carry significant consequences. Recognizing the emotions that stem from this fraternal bond means grappling with the repercussions they bring. When one looks into their brother's eyes, they see their own true self, not how others perceive them. Their true nature is revealed in their actions and the outcomes of those actions. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers examine this theme and the intense emotions that accompany it. In a detailed, vibrant setting, these two boys embark on a hopeless journey. In the climax, bitterness and intense pride collide, and only one brother survives. The theme is conveyed through the direct depiction of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which showcases the intricate feelings experienced by the protagonist and their worldview, both of which greatly influence their actions. The protagonist's actions are driven by a primary emotion: pride. From their initial outing to their fateful final journey, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He desired a brother he could teach various skills, like holding his breath, running, jumping, or navigating Old Woman Swamp. He yearned for a brother who could join him in races to Horsehead Landing or perch with him in the top fork of a great pine behind the barn. However, Doodle's fragile heart made it near impossible for him to participate in such activities. The reality was a harsh blow to the young protagonist's dreams. He even considered murdering the child by suffocating him with a pillow, yet his heart softened when Doodle smiled at him. This simple act gave the protagonist hope and revealed that his resolve to harm Doodle was not strong. Deep down, he held a natural affection for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex and creative information processor. As technology has evolved from primitive to advanced, the metaphors used to describe the brain have also evolved. Initially, the brain was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. It's important to keep in mind that these metaphors, while useful, can also lead to erroneous conclusions.\n\nThe brain's information processing begins with sensory organs transforming physical stimuli, such as touch, heat, sound waves, or light, into electrochemical signals. This information is then processed in both bottom-up and top-down ways. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines simple details like color, orientation, and border changes to identify the object. Top-down processing uses previous decisions to speed up object recognition. For example, it can help identify a black box rather than a black hole.\n\nOnce information is processed, an attention filter decides its importance and which cognitive processes should access it. For instance, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually, but you might pick out your name in a noisy room. There are multiple processing stages, and attention repeatedly modulates the results.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it must first store it. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Information is encoded in various ways depending on the type of stimuli. Verbal input can be encoded structurally (appearance of the word), phonemically (sound of the word), or semantically (meaning of the word). Once stored, information must be maintained. Working memory, which stores information for about 20 seconds, is maintained by looping electrical signals through specific neurons. Long-term memory is believed to be maintained by the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are many models explaining how knowledge is organized in the brain, including those based on how humans retrieve memories, computer science principles, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model suggests that knowledge is organized into nodes representing concepts, with nodes linked based on their relatedness. For example, a node for \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley in \"Brave New World\" raises concerns about the impending dangers of technology and capitalism. Society prioritizes community over individualism and instills a pursuit of immediate happiness from birth. Citizens are pawns in a system controlled by the World Controller, who dictates a singular ideology. Analyzing the novel through Marxist lens reveals Huxley's criticisms of these systems. He employs Marxist concepts like homogenization and reification to highlight the flaws of the emerging capitalist economy. Capitalism is critiqued through the Marxist idea of false consciousness, where the common people lack understanding of their economic relationships, focused instead on personal gain due to ideological control. The conditioning of citizens, such as through hypnopædia, enforces a desire to consume and indulge, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, where one class dominates another, is evident as lower classes are unaware of their manipulation, while higher classes, like Alphas and Betas, accept their positions. Relationships in Brave New World lack depth, with characters' interactions being superficial and focused on physical attributes, suggesting that technology and capitalism stifle free will and expression. Love and extreme emotions are absent, and societal complacency indicates a capitalist-induced obedience.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for roughly two and a half years, which equates to four and a half semesters. Navigating around campus can be challenging for many, including myself. During my freshmen year, I resided in an East Halls dorm room, ironically located at the farthest eastern point of the campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traversing from Stuart Hall to classes at various locations such as the Willard building, which is centrally located, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially during bad weather, a common occurrence in State College. I talked to an alumnus who informed me that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the main campus by vast tracts of unused land. Today, this empty space has been transformed into sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services, and is now surrounded by apartments. As the campus continues to grow, the problem of mobility becomes increasingly more difficult. What is the ideal solution? On a college campus, it would be a bicycle. However, a bicycle alone cannot solve the problem. Students must utilize them, and the campus must be designed to accommodate cyclists.\n\nI discussed this with a friend who recently restarted bicycling after a several-year break. He said, \"Bikes are great. For a few years, it wasn’t trendy to ride a bike, but it's the only viable way to get around.\" Besides being good for one's health, bicycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical exertion can cover 30 miles or more. Like many of my peers, I now live off-campus, as far from the campus center as some dorms. The best decision I made this year was to buy a bike. Classes in Thomas building, roughly a 25-minute walk from my home, can be reached in just 5 minutes by bike, if pedaled quickly. The main issue is that Pollock Road, the direct route to Thomas building from my house, isn't always easy to navigate, whether by bike or on foot. While walking has its merits, I'm too busy to do so. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would add an additional 30-40 minutes to my daily routine, totaling over two and a half hours per week. Adding the time spent walking to and from other classes, appointments, and other activities, would amount to more time than I can afford."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In my quest to become a social worker, I aim to focus on the Division of Family and Children Services, where I can assist children who have experienced abuse or neglect, and offer support to troubled families. The values I bring to the social work field are service, respect, ethical conduct, a commitment to strengthening relationships among individuals, and a dedication to continuous professional growth to stay competent. These values are not just essential for social workers; they are deeply important to me personally.\n\nMy desire to help others has been a constant throughout my life, but I was uncertain about the career path that would suit me best. Throughout high school and college, I observed many people avoiding their problems in denial and resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms. Witnessing these situations led me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Despite this, I was still uncertain about my career path, so I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009.\n\nOne summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy who was nervously sitting on her couch. She explained that he was there to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that the boy had contacted the police. I went to his parents' house to offer assistance. The police asked me to talk to the parents, and I saw that they were nervous and blamed their son for involving outsiders. This experience made me seriously consider a career in social work to help children with family disputes.\n\nSocial justice is another critical value in the field of social work. Our society claims the individual is important but often follows outdated traditions rather than embracing uniqueness. If we mourn lost individuals, why do we strive to be like everyone else? I am an individual who refuses to limit myself to fit societal norms. Throughout my years in high school and college, I challenged social injustice by coloring my hair unnaturally, wearing unique clothing, piercing my ears beyond traditional norms, joining GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and standing against racism and discrimination.\n\nI believe in social justice and will continue to resist social injustice throughout my life.",
            "This study explores the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to insomnia, addressing insomnia's biological aspects, which emphasize genetics and medical factors, and sociocultural aspects, which consider environmental influences like race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The review delves into these models, presenting and explaining the chosen research, and critiques their strengths and weaknesses. Insomnia can manifest as a primary disorder, a co-occurring mental disorder, or be related to medical conditions or substances. Primary sleep disorders are Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while those related to mental disorders are linked to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Dyssomnias involve problems with sleep initiation or maintenance, such as Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia. Parasomnias, like Nightmare Disorder or Sleepwalking Disorder, present with behavioral or physiological abnormalities. The review concentrates on insomnia and primary sleep disorders, focusing on both biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders centers on genetic factors, heritable traits, and physiological aspects. Orexin-expressing neurons in the hypothalamus regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that GABAB receptors on orexin neurons control sleep/wake states. The activation of GABAA receptors induces sleep, and their inhibition can reduce anxiety and promote sleep. The GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep duration in mice, suggesting that human sleep patterns might be influenced by this receptor. A dysfunction or absence of this receptor could impair sleep quality without medication. Socioculturally, if this phenotype is inherited, it could influence sleep regulation and negatively impact daily life, affecting areas like education, career, and tasks requiring sustained focus.",
            "This paper discusses three main aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Firstly, it offers a brief explanation of what the disorder entails. Second, it details the diagnostic process, including common indicators, or \"red flags\". Lastly, the paper concludes with strategies for teachers in mainstream classrooms to support students with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is defined as the efficiency and effectiveness with which the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. Specifically, CAP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory data within the CNS and the neurobiological activity that underpins this processing and generates electrophysiological auditory responses. Essentially, it is a condition where the brain struggles to process sounds as it should. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally, so they are not considered \"hearing impaired\"; instead, their brain's ability to interpret and distinguish sound, such as separating words or differentiating speech from background noise, is impaired.\n\nThe earliest reference to the disorder, originally called \"auditory imperception,\" dates back to the mid-1950s when researchers studied children with communication difficulties. This work led to the development of tests by the Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari in 1954, and the introduction of dichotic testing by Kimura in 1961, which formulated a model to explain the underlying physiology of the central nervous system in auditory perception. A significant national conference in 1977 further stimulated research on children with CAPD.\n\nThe symptoms of CAPD vary and can include difficulty in localizing sounds, distinguishing between multiple sounds, recognizing sound patterns, detecting changes in speech (such as sarcasm), being unable to filter out one sound when another is present, having trouble interpreting sound cues, and struggling to determine the sequence of auditory information.\n\nDiagnosis of CAPD involves a comprehensive evaluation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests that assess auditory function, which can be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals using various methods. These assessments may include questionnaires, observations of auditory behaviors, and responses to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single, universally effective diagnostic tool or known cause for the disorder. Common tests present patients with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and ask them to differentiate specific items such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to these signals.",
            "Twelfth Night suggests that while disguise can be beneficial for extended deceptions, ultimately, one must discard the assumed persona to prevent losing their true self. Discontinuing a deception can lead to isolation, as it may disrupt relationships. While some might react calmly upon discovering the deception, others could be offended, causing tension in their connections. The theme of deception in gender role reversal is particularly complex, as it raises questions about why individuals feel compelled to hide their identity. In Viola's case, her disguise as Cesario is a means of self-preservation. Arriving in a new land, she pretends to be a man to protect herself from potential threats, but this also separates her from female company, isolating her from a crucial support network. Her convincing portrayal of a man causes Olivia to fall in love with her, adding to her romantic complications. Shakespeare's characters, through their experiences with Cesario, may reveal latent emotions they had kept hidden. Olivia's transition from loving Cesario to seeing Viola as a sister suggests she was more judgmental of outward appearances than genuinely harboring feelings for women.",
            "The harshness of German colonial rule, evident in the genocides of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa, does not accurately represent the entirety of their colonial empire. German colonial rule varied vastly in its policies and administration across diverse geographical regions. Educational provision in these colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a significant population of educated and literate Africans. Similarly, the education initiatives in Kamerun and other colonies were commended by contemporary authors. In contrast, South West Africa (present-day Namibia) experienced a starkly different situation. Unlike in East Africa, where the government actively participated in the education of natives, in South West Africa, the responsibility for educating the natives was largely delegated to missionary societies with limited government support. However, the government did invest considerable resources in the education of Europeans, establishing a state school system and extensively supporting and regulating missionary schools. These policies had lasting effects on South West Africa, even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies boasted a substantial number of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to the unique experience of South West Africa. This paper aims to explore these factors and focus on new research into the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is a wealth of literature on education during the German colonial period, much of it in German and written in the early 20th century, during or immediately after the period of German colonial rule. Early works largely described the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later English writings expanded this discourse through comparative studies of education across various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects. These studies highlighted significant differences in educational systems among the colonies. Cohen’s study on education in South West Africa and East Africa is particularly notable. Cohen compares the educational systems of these two colonies and discusses the factors that account for their differences. According to Cohen, the substantial settler population in South West Africa contributes to the distinctive aspects of its educational system.\n\nCompared to other German colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately friendly climate, though much of its territory is arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected these mild conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, compared to only 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The evolution of popular music has seen an explosion in genres over the past century, making it challenging to enumerate them all. Each genre—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—has spawned numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. Among these, heavy metal rock has emerged as one of the most diverse and expressive genres within popular music over the past four decades. Its expressiveness is evident through a wide range of emotions, predominantly on the darker side. Its diversity is marked by the early recognition of the genre's flexibility, which led to the creation of various sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, with this pattern continuing to this day.\n\nToday, the heavy metal genre has evolved to encompass so many niches that defining it precisely is difficult. It has absorbed themes from other genres but has its roots somewhere. To comprehend the metal music prevalent today, one must first understand the essence of the metal movement—why it is considered a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is defined by its darker tones. It is often referred to as the \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more theatricality. Performers in metal bands exhibit advanced instrumental skills, which are evident in their music. Additionally, metal is often associated with the use of drugs, particularly during the psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70s. These substances were used to create otherworldly records, serving as a vehicle for artistic expression. The genre possesses dark, visceral qualities that were relatively new to the music scene, providing an emotional depth often lacking in popular music. Later generations of metal have drawn influence from the Romantic Era's darker and visceral qualities. Lyrics like those from Helter Skelter by The Beatles, which express the darker side of the band, illustrate this. The song was a response to The Rolling Stones' heavier and darker music and is considered one of the early heavy metal tracks.",
            "Before the Surrealists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was already crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. His 1910 painting, The Dream, is not only a depiction of a woman in awe of the wonders she encounters in her dream but also a reflection of Rousseau's own personal dreams and aspirations as an artist. Throughout his career, he dreamt of recognition, acceptance, and praise from other artists and art enthusiasts, facing an internal conflict between conforming to or mimicking established painting styles to gain acceptance or staying true to his unique creative vision. The Dream encapsulates this lifelong internal struggle.\n\nTo fully understand The Dream, we must first be aware of Rousseau's background. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval, northwest France, Rousseau's father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer. He received no formal art training but worked as a gabelou (employee of the municipal toll service), earning the nickname \"douanier\" (customs inspector) despite his lower-class background. After the deaths of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children, Rousseau turned to painting for comfort and a fresh start. Unlike his contemporaries, Rousseau did not idealize or romanticize the peasant in his art; he was a folk painter with the hopes and dreams of the common people.\n\nRousseau's desire for art-world acceptance is understandable given his context. Lacking formal training and starting his career late, he was producing works alongside prominent, better-known artists of his time. Recognition for his art began to come around the same time Matisse was building his reputation. Jan Gordon, in the book Modern French Painters, notes that while they were competitors, Matisse and Rousseau differed in their motivations: Matisse sought to avoid painting in a clichéd manner, while Rousseau yearned to paint in a conventional way to be accepted by the Artiste Français.",
            "Numerous great thinkers have posited an inherent link between ethics and aesthetics, as well as between truth and beauty. I contend that this is due to a fundamental reason. As John Keats observes in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty — That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of what we learn in life comes from education or experience, we often appreciate ethics and aesthetics without formal instruction, as Keats suggests. Both fields aim to describe rather than dictate. Our explorations of morality and beauty are primarily attempts to understand why a piece of art or literature is beautiful or why an action is moral, rather than definitive rules for evaluating or creating good art or moral behavior. Critiquing art or morality, however, often fails to fully capture what is truly good or beautiful. A discussion about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but ultimately, these don't explain why it's considered good art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often resort to phrases like \"there's just something about it\" before offering more detailed explanations. I believe that both art and morality cannot be fully reduced to descriptions of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor puts it, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” Similarly, ethics possesses this same ineffable quality. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I propose that this elusive 'something' — this je ne sais quoi — is art and morality's most potent attribute, and it is this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics that forges a connection between them. Moreover, I believe that morality and art are so interconnected because we experience them most vividly at a noumenal level, using a Kantian term. They impact us deeply, even if the reasons for this impact cannot be fully explained. This connection is even stronger when it comes to literary art. As McKean asserts, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values...Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Germany today is a powerful, unified nation, with a distinct culture that stretches from the alpine region around Munich to the Baltic Sea coast at Kiel, and from Cologne on the Rhine River to the heart of Germany, and on to the Saxon city of Dresden along the Elbe River. Given this rich cultural diversity, it's not surprising that Germany, as we know it today, is a blend of various origins and ethnic groups. The name \"Germany\" itself is of uncertain origin, with different theories suggesting it comes from the name of a Germanic tribe (the Tungrians), their use of spears, or the Old Irish word for \"shout\". Early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"On the Origin and Situation of the Germans\", described the Germans as an original, unmixed race who settled in Germany through seafaring, not immigration or mixing with other races. The Romans, while they did engage in trade and occasional campaigns in Germania, generally preferred to send their conquests there rather than themselves. As a result, the Germanic tribes living on the Roman Empire's borders traded goods and skills with the Romans, contributing to the development of what is now Germany.",
            "I gazed downwards, my mind blankly taking in the scene before me. I observed the object of study without emotion, my practiced awareness declining to connect it to any abstract understanding. Thoughts darted in and out of my mind so swiftly that it seemed I had no personal thoughts; instead, I was merely experiencing an active and fluid perception of what I was looking at. Once, following the advice of an artist I had worked with, I bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" My lifelong desire to learn to draw had driven me to this book, which teaches from understanding basic tools to the brain's processes in interpreting lines. One technique it taught was to place a square frame around any image to simplify it; for instance, a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room would become a simple bowl of fruit on a flat plane. At that moment, staring at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't imagine framing the scene. I was so overwhelmed and awestruck that I could only stand and marvel. Masters like Picasso (blue phase), Monet (greenery), and Italian Renaissance artists (rainbow of colors) had already set precedents for artistic perspective. Before me were the beginnings of my own work, the start of my story, \"Work in Brown.\" My fingers touched my chosen tool, my muscles tensing and relaxing as my hand moved through space, my mind giving form to the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled serenely and clearly, flakes of matter breaking away and disappearing. My hand struck the toilet handle again, more anxiously this time, but the offending brown package refused to budge, stuck like a slug. Grip on the mop tight, feet planted wide, a green tie uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter left as a message for bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet introspection, then my hand reached for the wall, gripped the end of the toilet paper, and began wrapping itself like an oven mitt. Standing upright, then bending at the waist, my hand slowly dipped into the bowl, like a mother preparing to retrieve a Thanksgiving turkey from the oven.",
            "Teenagers are perishing in car crashes. Multiple factors coalesce to make this a deadly trend for young American drivers. The National Institutes of Health reveal that a significant aspect of the issue is the immaturity of the teenage brain when it comes to driving dangers. Lack of experience further exacerbates the problem, leading to more fatal collisions, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and road departure incidents.\nTeens are especially vulnerable when driving with peers, which is common knowledge among those with any sense. Research by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center indicates that the age of passengers correlates with the frequency of traffic accidents.\nSeveral states, including California, have implemented temporary provisional licenses to mitigate teen driver safety, limiting driving hours and prohibiting other minors as passengers. However, these measures are insufficient as a group, as young drivers statistically struggle with the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman asserts that even at 18, teens are not ready for regular driver's licenses. Studies suggest that teens under 19-20 are inclined to take risks for the thrill, making it logical to delay driving until this tendency subsides. If we continue to grant driver's licenses to young teens, we will likely see an uptick in deadly accidents, potentially reaching alarming proportions as the current generation of teens becomes eligible to drive.\nA reasonable legislative approach would be to maintain driver's education classes in schools, blocking anyone under 18 from operating a vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued, with a required number of practical driver's training hours, based on current state standards (e.g., 6 hours in California). Since teen driving deaths are widespread, national legislation could effectively protect teens nationwide. This proposed legislation is not unprecedented.",
            "After browsing through the Library of Congress's archive of Edison's early films, I decided to watch all 15 trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films primarily use creative editing to create illusions. My analysis mainly involved describing the visual style of most trick films and exploring the unique characteristics of a few later films. Most trick films from this era are confined to a single set, using a frontal proscenium stage, with no camera movement, and feature long or medium shots, adhering to the rule that one shot equals one film. However, a few films at the start of the 20th century did break these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA common trait among these trick films is that they are shot within an interior set framed by a frontal proscenium, with the camera remaining stationary. This style, borrowed from theatre and vaudeville, limits movement to side-to-side within the frame, as seen in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). Actors enter from the side and move horizontally, never walking towards or away from the camera or having the camera follow them.\n\nLong and medium shots are common, with close-ups never being used in these trick films, reflecting the traditions of theatre and vaudeville where the entire performance was visible within the stage borders. This style also limits the dramatic or narrative potential of trick films, as they often focus on brief vaudeville-style tricks like magic or disappearing acts, with little story. Note that, despite the apparent single shot, a single \"shot\" in a trick film often consists of multiple physical shots edited together to create illusions. For instance, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a closer look reveals that the physical shot with Mary's \"severed head\" begins at a specific point, although the film is perceived as a single shot by the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate supporter of the Republican Party. His background as a farmer and brief political career shaped him into a champion of personal liberty and government reform. His deep commitment to an agrarian society informed much of his views on governance, sovereignty, and the judicial system. Taylor believed that the U.S. had the chance to establish an ideal government system due to the absence of native traditions that could hinder its creation. He held firm beliefs in the interdependence of natural rights, asserting that their denial would diminish the value of those that remain. In his view, a government should be designed to account for human nature's inherent good and evil. Taylor believed that good principles should protect private property, promote agriculture, and discourage capitalism. He thought that a government founded on such principles would function fairly regardless of its administration, which would be driven by avarice and self-interest. He also advocated for a strong, limited federal government with powers explicitly stated in the Constitution, as an extensive federal government could become corrupt and oppressive. Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defines the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, commuter log submissions sharply declined in the third month of the project. The reason behind this drop is unclear. In December, fewer people are commuting by bike or on foot due to winter, and students and faculty are busy with end-of-semester tasks and holiday preparations. The project's initial excitement might have also faded. To reignite participation, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which boosted log submissions. However, the project faced challenges, including holiday breaks and the general preference for driving. To encourage alternative commuting, we offered various prizes, such as gift cards to local businesses. Larger prizes like bicycles or hybrid/electric cars could have further increased engagement. Even increasing the value of the prizes over time might have helped maintain momentum.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a financial instrument designed to mimic an index, commodity, or a collection of assets, similar to an index fund, but with the added flexibility of trading like a stock on an exchange. ETFs offer the diversification of index funds and the advantages of individual stock ownership, such as short selling, margin purchases, and buying as few as one share. While these perks are appealing, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios than typical mutual funds. However, there are drawbacks, like the necessity of paying commissions on trades, similar to stock transactions. ETFs also offer a wide variety of funds, but it's crucial for savvy investors to assess whether these claimed benefits, like diversification, truly exist and to what extent.\n\nFor this analysis, we'll examine the ETF IHF and compare it with its top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of its assets. We'll determine if owning a single ETF can match the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of these 10 stocks, and whether there are better configurations of these stocks that could provide a higher Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo simplify the evaluation, we'll only include the top 10 holdings. We'll calculate the Beta and return of a portfolio composed of these 10 stocks, using their current asset proportions. The calculations are as follows:\n\nFrom these calculations, it's clear that a portfolio of the top 10 holdings could offer a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, with a 16% increase. Additionally, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF's. These findings suggest that a portfolio consisting of just these 10 stocks could yield a higher return with a lower Beta. However, we should also consider if these portfolios are statistically different.\n\nTo assess this, we'll determine the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% for comparison with the ETF IHF's standard deviation.",
            "Dream-land is considered one of Edgar Allan Poe's superior poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe employs the term \"Thule\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used this term to refer to an island north of Britain, considered the extremity of the known world by the Greeks. While Virgil did indeed use the term, another more contemporary source deserves credit, as Poe was particularly interested in German authors. This usage demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's work. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" highlights the similarities between their poems, concluding that Poe was imitating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was a renowned writer of the poetic drama Faust, published in two parts—the first in 1808 and the second upon his death in 1832. In the second part of Faust, there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" This poem describes a king whose wife's death after giving him a goblet leads him to drink heavily and mourn, eventually deciding to end his life by throwing the goblet into the ocean. The King of Thule's fate echoes the dark despair in \"Dream-Land,\" possibly reflecting Poe's own struggles with grief and addiction. Faust was also adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe refers to \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and uses the term \"Thule\" twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule as dark, lonely, and haunted by dead friends, resembling the state of the king in \"The King of Thule,\" who is also lonely and has lost his will to live. The entire poem reads as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe's world.\n\nGoethe was a significant author that Poe would have known, if only through his admiration for Tennyson. When asked if he admired Tennyson, Poe praised him and would have been exposed to Goethe's work through numerous reproductions following its original publication.",
            "In California, the injured customer, Jennifer Palmer, may be able to seek punitive damages if she can prove that the store manager, Paul Martin, acted with malicious intent. This would require showing that Martin knew or should have known about the potential harm of leaving the applesauce spill uncleaned for a half-hour, despite two employees having already reported it. Although Martin's actions were likely despicable, given the previous six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009, his failure to clean the spill might still warrant a punitive damage award.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, employee Rich Wayne informed Martin about the spill but was told that Martin was on dinner break and couldn't handle it. Another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, informed Martin at 5:15 pm, but again, Martin declined to address the spill. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, causing a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, there had been five similar incidents reported. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nUnder California law, punitive damages for a breach not arising from a contract can be awarded if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" If the defendant acted with ill intent to cause harm, or if their actions were despicable and willfully disregarded the safety of others, punitive damages may be justified. In this case, the court will examine whether to partially dismiss Palmer's punitive damage claim based on whether Martin's actions fit this definition.",
            "Four years ago, I enrolled in an Islam course at CBC, where the topic of whether Islam is an antagonistic religion sparked passionate debate. This question feels more pertinent today than ever. Reflecting on the post-9/11 period, I've noticed a shift in American mass media's portrayal of Islam and extremism, ranging from hostility to extreme tolerance. For instance, in 2001, a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, with apparent Muslim heritage, would have been unthinkable. The Prophet Muhammad's biography has always intrigued me, as it seems to contradict his historical portrayal. While I initially believed Muhammad forced conversions and conquered tribes, his biography depicts him as a martyr and humble figure, with converts drawn to his teachings. This portrayal shares uncanny similarities with Jesus' ministry and miracles, potentially diminishing Christ's life and miracles by attributing them to Muhammad. Furthermore, the biography relies heavily on third-party accounts, which can make the stories seem less credible. My main concern is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly, humble, and wise figure, despite historical evidence suggesting otherwise. If Muslims today knew Muhammad's true rise to power, I believe it would be challenging for them to maintain this image.",
            "The teachings and beliefs that Jesus held during his time were initially discarded in the evolution of Christian thought. If we examine this historical trajectory in a broad sense, a noticeable trend emerges: Christianity has been progressively diverging from its roots over time. Today's world is marked by an increasing awareness and a trend towards progressive ideas. While traditionalists persist and resist anything outside their learned beliefs, their influence may be limited. Among Christians, a growing historical awareness will lead to a desire to distinguish the doctrines added over time from the original intent behind Christianity. This process could take decades or even centuries, but the inevitable result will be a significant shift in Christian history. It will involve a movement that strips away layers of doctrine, as if reversing time, until only the core of Jesus' teachings remain. This trend, once it spreads across the United States and Europe, will lead to a widespread return to the worship practices and beliefs of Jesus' time. While the church as an institution will remain strong, the diversity within Christianity will decrease, with greater uniformity of belief and practice emerging. This reversal of history in the realm of Christianity is not unprecedented; after all, Christianity went from being persecuted by the Roman Empire to becoming a pillar of that empire. Similarly, our country has seen a shift from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The future will see a similar reversion in Christianity, undoing the diversity while returning to the source. A key factor in this process will be interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically rather than literally. To understand what happened after Jesus' lifetime, we need to look back to the roots of the Christian religion, which are found in Judaism. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., Judaism was characterized by monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures. However, the Jewish population at this time was not unified and was divided into various groups, including Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "Upton Sinclair's novel, The Jungle, illustrates the inherent greed and self-interest of human nature. People, by their very nature, are inclined to prioritize their own well-being and comfort, often disregarding those less fortunate. The novel demonstrates this through various aspects, particularly the factory owners and managers. Their sole objective is to expand their businesses and factories without regard for the consequences. They are indifferent to any harm caused to people or animals due to their operations. Sinclair vividly depicts the environmental destruction caused by pollution, describing the \"great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories\" and the \"river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". The workers are also subjected to harsh conditions, working long hours with little pay and no job security. The lack of worker protections or regulations during that era allowed managers and owners to exploit workers without consequence. The desperate conditions led to the formation of unions, but many were corrupt and exploited workers even further. The workers were effectively enslaved, working and living in appalling conditions, \"dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers\".",
            "Many authors employ various techniques to evoke specific impressions or attitudes in their readers' minds when addressing significant subjects. Some methods are more effective than others. In his novel The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald employs a range of these techniques. He often uses unusual adjective-noun pairings to create a certain atmosphere around a subject. Additionally, he invests symbols with meaning and employs them for the same purpose. Fitzgerald utilizes this approach with several colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald assigns special significance to white/gray and red/pink, building up their meanings and then using these meanings later to convey specific feelings about important objects.\n\nFitzgerald associates white with elegance and sophistication, while gray represents age and faded quality. He establishes this meaning with consistent use of these colors at the beginning of the novel. Daisy and Jordan are frequently “in white” (8), and most characters at Gatsby's party wear white: Nick is in “white flannels” (41), Tom wears a “white shirt” (36), and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). The only exception is when Nick observes Gatsby's party, where he describes the halls as “gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further reinforces these associations by applying white and gray to mundane subjects and people: Nick works in “white chasms” (56), party attendees have “gray names” (61), Catherine’s apartment is part of a “long white cake of apartment-houses” (28), Jordan and Daisy share a “white girlhood” (19), and there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of ashes. After imbuing white/gray with specific meanings, Fitzgerald uses them to convey feelings of unimportance or uniformity. The first instance of this is Daisy: after a long period without significant use of white or gray, she is described as “dressed in white” in a “little white roadster” (74), making her appear less distinct and more like a uniform desire for Gatsby. Fitzgerald employs this technique repeatedly around Daisy to emphasize her uniform nature. For example, her fur collar is described as a “gray haze” (18) and she wears a “white” dress (115) before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County's agricultural prowess is driven by its temperate, sunny climate, with crops like tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers thriving here. The demand for organic, locally grown produce is strong, with many community-supported agriculture initiatives boasting long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Some organic farms offer tours and recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching. This type of operation can leverage government programs to benefit both the environment and profits. Additionally, organic farming fosters greater biodiversity due to the absence of chemicals, but it also demands more labor and management to maintain yields. Furthermore, it can lack the scale efficiency of larger farms. Landowners might seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profits and habitat quality. The selected property is a 160-acre parcel in Potrero, unincorporated San Diego County, adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest, within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion. This area has a high concentration of endangered and declining species, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterflies, California gnatcatcher, and burrowing owls. Originally inhabited by Native Americans and later used for grazing and wood production, this land is now being considered for organic farming. Government programs and a nearby organic farm model were researched to explore potential cost mitigation and wildlife-friendly farming practices.",
            "Culture's impact on negotiations is substantial. Defined by what it is not, and what it signifies, culture isn't uniform or specific. Stereotypes like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are too broad and simplistic. A negotiator should focus on the cultural significance of the situation and how it influences discussions. When encountering a different culture, one naturally compares it to their own. Understanding foreign cultures involves studying history or recognizing biases, not judging or changing them. Acceptance and working within cultural boundaries are key, especially with a weaker bargaining position. Respect for traditions can help overcome cultural barriers and advance negotiations. Moreover, culture isn't limited to national identities; many companies have unique corporate cultures, evident in work hours, communication styles, and hiring practices. Some companies encourage employee philanthropy, while others limit it, highlighting the diversity within a society's culture. Cultural values, which drive behaviors, are crucial to understand. For instance, a culture valuing \"saving face\" makes public shaming unlikely, while a culture valuing hard bargains might delay settlements. Before negotiation, understanding cultural values and personal traits of opponents can enhance effectiveness.",
            "The fool has declared in their heart, 'There is no God.' This statement is initially presented in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and serves as the opening to St. Anselm's argument for the existence of God. It is also echoed by Thomas Aquinas. Since both arguments defend the same idea and we aim to compare them, we must assume they both genuinely believe in the existence of the biblical God. It would be impractical to consider any other divine entity for the purpose of this comparison. While both arguments present valid points, neither offers a comprehensive basis for believing in God.\n\nTo explore this, let's first look at St. Anselm's core argument. Anselm advocates for understanding God through faith, suggesting that proof of God's existence can be found within one's own mind. He argues that since God is a concept we can understand, we cannot logically deny his existence. Although his reasoning can be complex and unclear, his essence is that God's proof lies within our inherent self-knowledge. This is often termed 'faith' in Christian texts, where one accepts something without irrefutable empirical evidence.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, on the other hand, contends that God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, without requiring faith. This approach could be advantageous in spreading Christianity, as it would allow for conversion based on logic alone. Aquinas presents five logical arguments to support his view: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument essentially shows that the proof of God's existence lies in the logical necessity for such a being. If you have all but one piece of a puzzle, you can infer the existence and features of the missing piece by logical deduction.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a future figure known as the Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he renounced worldly desires and achieved enlightenment, giving rise to Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being its most traditional form. Now 2,500 years old, Buddhism has evolved significantly since the Buddha's time, particularly in Theravada countries like Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. Although Buddha didn't teach any religious festivities, this ceremony is observed by both monks and laypeople. The Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt and change its core beliefs due to both internal and external factors, ranging from friendly to hostile influences.\n\nThis discussion will frequently use the following terms: internal forces, which are driven by members of the Buddhist community regardless of their monastic status, and external forces, which originate from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community, while benign forces are neutral but may inadvertently assist or harm the community.\n\nFirst, let's examine the fundamental teachings of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists take refuge in the Three Jewels—the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, the teachings of the Buddha, is composed of the Tripitaka (Three Baskets) of scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Buddha's discourses, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the rules for monks and laypeople, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka explains Buddhist metaphysics, including concepts like Anatta (no self), Dukkha (suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these concepts allows one to escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and ultimately overcome desire (lobha), hatred (dosa), and delusion (moha) to achieve enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets out rules for both laypeople and monks, with laypeople following five precepts (not killing, not lying, not stealing, maintaining sexual purity, and avoiding intoxicants), while monks adhere to many more. The most crucial doctrinal tenet is the Four Noble Truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), suffering is caused by attachment, suffering can be ended, and the path to its cessation is the Middle Way.",
            "The United States and Mexico illustrate a historical rivalry that persisted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The peak of this rivalry was marked by the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States emerged victorious, acquiring Texas and the American Southwest. Various conflicts arose between the two nations throughout this period, subsiding before the onset of World War I. The rivalry stemmed from differences in religion, culture, tradition, and material interests (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31). This is not uncommon among neighboring nations that have enduring rivalries. While the United States shares geographical proximity and rivalries with Mexico and Cuba, other Latin American nations have maintained favorable relations with the United States. Religious differences, similar to those between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, were a significant factor in this rivalry. The historical distrust between the English and Spanish, inherited by their former colonies, posed significant challenges to establishing friendly relations. Diehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes during this 57-year period, most of which were territorial in nature, involving border raids and frontier issues. Schmitt (1974, p. 97) notes that the rivalry became less intense as Mexico increasingly depended on the United States, and it finally ended when American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the late 19th century (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was unexpectedly and severely disabled by a condition I had never heard of before. At the time, I was a nurse, a career choice driven by a deep need for security and stability, as I had lacked those growing up. The mantra \"There will always be work, and people will always need care\" was ingrained in me as I progressed through adolescence and into adulthood, despite my dream of becoming a scientist or journalist. However, at 46 years old, single, and with no financial savings, I was suddenly unable to work due to my disability. Now, 15 years later, I continue to live on Social Security Disability and have very little to call my own. Every day is a struggle, and my sense of security, safety, and self-esteem is constantly challenged. I've learned that while I may appear strong, true support comes from family and friends. Life's emergencies, both large and small, are inevitable, and no amount of preparation can overcome some challenges alone.\n\nI firmly believe that we, as a nation, need to stop relying solely on big government for help. While I agree with the need for self-reliance, I think we should also focus on rebuilding trust and mutual support within our communities. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies did not succeed by going it alone; they relied on cooperation and shared resources. So, while I encourage being prepared with disaster kits and supplies, I also urge you to build connections with your neighbors.",
            "The question remains: how and why do organisms evolve as they do? What constraints may influence the direction of evolutionary change? Although D'Arcy Thompson, in 1917, suggested that even the simplest organic forms are yet to be defined mathematically, recent advancements have applied mathematical modeling to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis, both in terms of ontogeny and phylogeny. Our study aims to use mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum, combined with experimental research, to understand the mechanisms behind the evolution of developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that can model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters were input into the CerioShell software. We modeled hypothetical shell forms to interpret the limits of possible morphological change in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better comprehend macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a spiral tube that evolves through 360 degrees of space. These spirals, or whorls, revolve around an imaginary central axis called the columella. The rate at which whorls expand can vary, and each whorl is separated by a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last one, known as the body whorl. The spire consists of all whorls except the last one. The top of the spire is called the apex, and the bottom is the base. The animal exits the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be examined from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. The typical orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, view the shell from the apical view and identify the first suture. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts. Count the whorls from this line, estimating a quarter whorl if necessary.\n\nShells can be considered a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal grows its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced using the coordinates of each whorl's aperture center and its horizontal and vertical radius.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical model is established, parameters can be varied to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have been relatively unchanged over the past decade. Although the nation is progressing towards achieving many Millennium Development Goals, especially in water and sanitation, the advancements in child and maternal health are insufficient to meet the 2015 targets. The reasons for these shortfalls will be explored below, indicating a need to bolster the overall health system rather than focusing on specific interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in the number of births attended by skilled health workers, reaching 72%. However, this figure still includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot provide medical interventions during complications, which is why maternal mortality due to hemorrhage remains high. This suggests that progress in this area is superficial, and there is still significant work to be done. Additionally, the percentage of children under five years old with diarrhea treated by a health professional has decreased, and postnatal care data is incomplete, indicating concerns in this area as well.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain low, at around 4%. This points to another issue: while urban areas have a c-section rate of 7%, rural areas have a rate of 2%. This disparity highlights inequities in healthcare access, with services concentrated in urban areas. Furthermore, vertical equity is a concern, as the richest and poorest quintiles differ significantly in service utilization, with a 27% gap. This disparity suggests that the poor have more difficulty accessing healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering ways to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is how to best address the lack of service. Should Indonesia focus on developing targeted program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system, without concentrating solely on pre- and post-pregnancy care? While programmatic approaches are appealing due to their targeted and manageable objectives and faster results, there are drawbacks to consider. One major concern is that investing heavily in specific health areas can lead to neglect in other sectors due to redirected funding and human resources. Moreover, running multiple parallel programs can result in service duplication, increased paperwork, and uncoordinated efforts.",
            "Victorian literature is known for its meticulous attention to detail and focus on the upper-class society of the time. Two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which incorporate mystery and the unusual into their narratives, enhancing character development and psychological depth. Both novels often use dream sequences or dreamlike states to convey this mystery, with each book employing it differently. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences provide insights into Oliver's inner turmoil, his awareness of his surroundings, and his pain. When he relives the shooting in chapter 28, it is as if in a dream, highlighting his loss of control over events and the dire state of his health. The shooting itself is overwhelming for Oliver, his senses numbed and his despair intensified. The passage suggests that Oliver's misfortunes are not of his own making, and he lacks control over his life's outcomes. His inability to react or take control reflects a growing sense of defeat, possibly due to the influence of Fagin.",
            "Two years back, I was part of an after-school program tutoring elementary-aged students. I did my best to assist them in whichever subject they were struggling with, although I excelled more in English and reading. I was approached by one of the instructors to help a young boy named Adrian, who was in third or fourth grade and having a lot of trouble reading. It soon became clear that something was off. He had peculiar issues with reading; he could pronounce some letters perfectly, while others he couldn't pronounce at all. Strangely, he was of Latino descent and spoke perfect English. We faced challenges until I met Adrian's mother. During a babysitting session (to keep the stragglers occupied), his mother walked in. She only spoke Spanish, and I, with my limited Spanish knowledge, communicated with her. It dawned on me: Adrian could read well; he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if this realization helped him, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, especially in California. It also demonstrates that the problem isn't always as apparent as we think. Even a child who speaks perfect English can struggle with reading. This is a known issue, so what's the solution? For Adrian, it was straightforward—tutoring in English reading, particularly the alphabet and pronunciation. But for many children who barely speak English, the solution is more complex. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. Combining various methods is key: dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—none alone will solve the problem.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is a valuable approach. It benefits not just children whose first language is Spanish, but all children. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. However, there's fear and misconception that it's a waste of resources and doesn't benefit the majority. This isn't accurate. If implemented as the norm rather than the exception, all children would benefit. But how do we make this happen? Requiring all teachers to be bilingual isn't realistic. Instead, we could have specialized aides or tutors who are bilingual.",
            "From childhood, many of us are introduced to the idea of something greater than ourselves, something we can't fully grasp. Some learn about this through religious instruction, while others seek answers within themselves or their families. Some readily accept these beliefs, while others reject them, claiming there's nothing beyond our own thoughts and experiences. We all have our own ways of exploring spirituality, searching for meaning and light in the darkness. \"A cardinal,\" my father said in response to my question about his favorite bird. We were sitting on our front porch, listening to the rain, smoking. He was thinner, his clothes loose, his hair thin. He gazed into the rain, almost lost in thought.

I hugged him, moved my chair closer, and looked out into the rain with him.\n\nMy father passed away in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The treatments had prolonged his suffering but not eased it. What was the purpose of enduring more pain and time? I wondered if God had stopped caring about me. I didn't pray. I couldn't bear to watch him die, so I stayed away. I wanted to remember him by his life, not his death. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for news. No one called me.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, as Ian Watt describes in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, essentially an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New',\" blending old and new elements. The Gothic genre has been both criticized and admired, described as having little depth and praised for its ability to evoke a 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The original Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, combined elements of old and modern romances to establish the proto-Gothic genre and a new method of storytelling. Walpole employed old theatrical elements and new representations of nature within modern novels to create what he termed \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre draws heavily from medieval Gothic theater, architecture, and traditions. Even in Walpole's time, the term \"Gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and time periods, often negatively, as archaic or unsophisticated compared to modern advancements. The fusion of traditional Gothic elements and the new, personal perspective of the novel contributed to Gothic's enduring popularity and its ability to seem both outdated and fresh to readers removed from the original time period.\n\nOne prominent theme in Gothic novels is chivalry, a medieval concept representing proper knightly training. In The Castle of Otranto, chivalry is both preserved and reimagined. Gothic authors, like Walpole, valued chivalry for its symbolism of bravery, honor, and competence, traits they felt were lacking in contemporary society. By incorporating chivalric elements and ideals, Walpole romanticized the \"gothic past\" and hinted at the future evolution towards Romanticism. Writing during a politically turbulent time, Walpole, amidst political turmoil and personal accusations, may have felt that the moral goodness and innate virtue of the Gothic era had been lost in modern society. This is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, including being a prince, suffering from tragedy, and being believed killed by infidels. His description exaggerates the trope of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves the series of steps for moving products from customer orders through raw materials, supply, production, and distribution to the final customer. The concept of supply chain management was introduced by Keith Oliver in 1982. It encompasses the planning, execution, and control of activities within the supply chain to meet customer needs swiftly and efficiently. Six key elements make up a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers employ these elements to deliver superior customer service.\n\nProduction is the initial step in the supply chain process. It is the cornerstone of the supply chain. Here, managers define the timing, purpose, location, and method of production. To understand customer needs, managers analyze the market as it is the primary indicator of customer demand. After assessing the market and understanding demand, managers decide which products to produce and in what quantities. They then choose the optimal location for production, considering volume and quality while ensuring customer satisfaction. Following this, managers focus on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. Production is crucial in the supply chain, requiring meticulous planning; neglecting details can lead to significant time and cost inefficiencies. For instance, companies like Wal-Mart and Target have detailed policies for every aspect of their operations, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments, ensuring smooth and confusion-free processes.\n\nThe second key element in supply chain management is supply. Supply involves strategic decisions about a facility's core capabilities and outsourcing relationships. A company might have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with unique equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must determine which division is best suited for each product's processes. Managers might also opt to outsource work to other companies, primarily to achieve quicker delivery times, improve flexibility, and reduce costs.",
            "A sign in Burma, which is also known as Myanmar, reads \"Hitler is alive.\" Ellen Page, the actor from the movie \"Juno,\" stands alone on a street corner holding a cardboard sign with this message written in Sharpie. Burma is a Southeast Asian country ruled by a military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, the country experienced street protests for the first time in a decade, led by monks, which earned the nickname \"The Saffron Revolution.\" The protests initially involved peaceful gatherings but escalated into violent conflicts between the monks and the government. The government cracked down on foreign journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai who was killed for being at a protest. The official death toll is 13, but a defected colonel suggests that many more people have been killed. This is not an isolated incident; similar atrocities have occurred throughout history, such as the Tiananmen Square protests, the Rwandan genocide, and Nazi Germany's persecution of Jews.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence on jazz music is largely due to his long career and his ability to direct his orchestra creatively. While Ellington's piano playing is often subtle in the compositions chosen for this assignment, he excelled as a composer in creating intricate pieces that highlighted the unique skills of his band members. He designed structures for soloists to improvise, wrote carefully orchestrated passages, and tailored his arrangements to suit each musician's style, fostering a cohesive and innovative sound. Ellington's mastery of individual players' voices and their collective ensemble sound enabled him to produce many groundbreaking jazz pieces.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary describes Ellington's sound and innovation, mentioning \"Creole Love Call\" as a notable example. In this piece, Ellington uses the voice as a jazz instrument to add texture and color. This technique, seen throughout his career, is exemplified in \"Creole Love Call,\" where the voice transitions between smooth and rough sounds and interacts with reeds, brass, and other instruments in a structured call-and-response pattern. The piece features six choruses, each with distinct solos and arrangements, showcasing Ellington's ability to complement his soloists' styles.\n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington demonstrates his skill in tight orchestration and tonal versatility. A call-and-response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing combines vocal elements of Miley's playing with instrumental qualities of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" builds on these ideas, as Ellington effectively uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone to introduce the melody, further emphasizing his approach to tone color and orchestration.",
            "She had always felt a persistent longing for something, a desire that remained unfulfilled. This sensation began when she was 14, around the time she entered her teenage years, and continued into her 17th year. By then, she had decided she wanted a person rather than an object, but no boy caught her interest. Several had shown attraction, attempted to woo her, but none seemed appealing. She often wondered about this peculiar situation, trying to understand what could cause such a reaction in a teenage girl. After years of contemplating, she had no satisfying theories.

            "This research aimed to demonstrate that sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", is linked to a reduced risk of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, and a lower risk of dying from stroke. The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet, emphasizing more plant-based foods such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, and replacing saturated fats with monounsaturated fats and fish. It also allows for moderate alcohol consumption. Previous studies have shown that following the Med diet is associated with a lower risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, and trials have found it more effective than a low-fat diet for weight loss and improving cholesterol levels in overweight individuals. However, prior research did not focus specifically on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, without a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. Over six periods from 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score based on self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) that assessed nutrient intake over the previous year. More than 95% of nurses continued participating throughout the 20-year period. FFQ data was validated. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. Cases without available records were classified as \"probable\" and included, representing about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of postmenopausal hormones were also considered, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo account for individual variability and represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed scores from repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for potential confounding factors such as age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the association between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke was assessed, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a decreased risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (including fatal CHD and strokes) were recorded. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a severe financial collapse. There was a surge in unemployment, a crack in the housing market, and many of the country's major corporations found themselves in ruins. This economic downturn continues to this day, necessitating questions about its origins and how to prevent such an event from happening again. In essence, the crisis was engineered by self-centered and naive political decisions that coerced banks and corporations into offering sub-prime loans to an ill-prepared and insufficient financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to back and repackage these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted, banks found themselves short on capital reserves and passed the chaos onto the repackaged mortgages, which in turn affected the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of the financial crisis were planted in 1999, during the Clinton administration's pursuit of a second term. To boost his popularity, Clinton eased lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times warned in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, faced increasing pressure from the Clinton administration to broaden mortgages to low- and moderate-income individuals, and from shareholders to maintain profit growth.\" He foresaw the inevitable consequences: \"However, the government-sponsored corporation might struggle in an economic downturn, potentially requiring a government bailout like the one for the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" This foreshadowed the repercussions of the imprudent lending practices.\n\nMultiple factors conspired to send the economy into a spin. Among them was the new, complex mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely utilized in the years preceding the crisis, further interlinking various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This increased households' and financial markets' exposure to the housing market, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nThe housing bubble burst, leaving financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities in distress. In 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, representing around 30% of the U.S. GDP. Consequently, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dissolved, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to convert into commercial banks under strict regulation. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Exposition in storytelling can be both a joy and a burden. It's where you flex your writing muscles, captivating readers with powerful, spellbinding prose. However, it can also be the part of your story that sends readers to sleep or prompts them to hit the \"Back\" button. Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her screen when she encounters \"Too Much Information\" that isn't engaging.\n\nExposition, while a crucial part of storytelling, is often a challenge. The common adage \"Show, don't tell\" rings true, yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself falling into lengthy passages that lack action or, worse, provide excessive detail. Essentially, exposition is the voice in your head urging you to share background information quickly to move the story forward.\n\nIn literature, exposition involves relaying past events in straightforward language. In movies, it typically occurs when one character explains a significant chunk of information to another. The author, in this case, is the one doing the telling.\n\nConsider this example: While reading a story, you find out that the protagonist met her love interest at a specific time and place, they got married in a grand ceremony, and her spouse was killed in front of her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire backstory to be told over two pages with only a few lines of dialogue between the couple. You'd expect the author to delve into the husband's character, demonstrating his deep love for his wife through his words and actions. Similarly, you'd expect the heroine to show how her husband's presence enriched her life, providing insights into her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams. This detailed introduction would help you emotionally connect with the husband's fate and understand the heroine's character better.\n\nIn essence, you must provide substance to the skeleton of your story, such as \"They met, they married, he died.\" As a writer, you must resist the urge to rush through these details. It's tempting to quickly introduce a new character with a mundane list of facts, like being in the Air Force, running a gas station, having a certain dietary preference, or secret dreams. Instead, weave these details into the narrative to create a compelling character profile.",
            "I caught two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, which was live this morning (August 13, 2011), was from NBC 4. The headline story featured a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife (they didn't mention her name). He was arrested, and they showed his mug shot, which was quite disturbing. The story only received about two minutes of coverage, which seemed appropriate given it was still developing. The next story was about an 18-year-old man named Travis Buyers who was shot in the Sharon Woods area and critically injured. There were no arrests at the time, and the SWAT team was investigating. This story seemed brief, and I believe that might be due to the fact that Buyers is a minority. I've noted this trend over the years: minority victims of crime often receive less media attention than white victims. The next story discussed a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, which was determined to be a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest. Another news item was about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus, where a dark-skinned black man in a hoodie sweatshirt was reported to have robbed the store. The coverage seemed to emphasize his race and physical description more than usual. The final story was about a convicted Texas drug kingpin, Rene Rodriguez, who had been sentenced to 300 months (or 25 years) in prison for conspiring to distribute marijuana. They also mentioned his Hispanic background, which I didn't find particularly relevant to the story.",
            "There exists an unyielding, indissoluble bond between brothers. This bond is a complex web of feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, among others. Brothers comprehend each other on a level no one else can, and they see themselves reflected in their sibling. In times of crisis, the essence of this bond becomes apparent, whether it manifests positively or negatively. When these emotions surface, they carry significant consequences. Recognizing the emotions that stem from this fraternal bond means grappling with the repercussions they bring. When one looks into their brother's eyes, they see their own true self, not how others perceive them. Their true nature is revealed in their actions and the outcomes of those actions. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers examine this theme and the intense emotions that accompany it. In a detailed, vibrant setting, these two boys embark on a hopeless journey. In the climax, bitterness and intense pride collide, and only one brother survives. The theme is conveyed through the direct depiction of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which showcases the intricate feelings experienced by the protagonist and their worldview, both of which greatly influence their actions. The protagonist's actions are driven by a primary emotion: pride. From their initial outing to their fateful final journey, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He desired a brother he could teach various skills, like holding his breath, running, jumping, or navigating Old Woman Swamp. He yearned for a brother who could join him in races to Horsehead Landing or perch with him in the top fork of a great pine behind the barn. However, Doodle's fragile heart made it near impossible for him to participate in such activities. The reality was a harsh blow to the young protagonist's dreams. He even considered murdering the child by suffocating him with a pillow, yet his heart softened when Doodle smiled at him. This simple act gave the protagonist hope and revealed that his resolve to harm Doodle was not strong. Deep down, he held a natural affection for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex and creative information processor. As technology has evolved from primitive to advanced, the metaphors used to describe the brain have also evolved. Initially, the brain was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. It's important to keep in mind that these metaphors, while useful, can also lead to erroneous conclusions.\n\nThe brain's information processing begins with sensory organs transforming physical stimuli, such as touch, heat, sound waves, or light, into electrochemical signals. This information is then processed in both bottom-up and top-down ways. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines simple details like color, orientation, and border changes to identify the object. Top-down processing uses previous decisions to speed up object recognition. For example, it can help identify a black box rather than a black hole.\n\nOnce information is processed, an attention filter decides its importance and which cognitive processes should access it. For instance, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually, but you might pick out your name in a noisy room. There are multiple processing stages, and attention repeatedly modulates the results.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it must first store it. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Information is encoded in various ways depending on the type of stimuli. Verbal input can be encoded structurally (appearance of the word), phonemically (sound of the word), or semantically (meaning of the word). Once stored, information must be maintained. Working memory, which stores information for about 20 seconds, is maintained by looping electrical signals through specific neurons. Long-term memory is believed to be maintained by the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are many models explaining how knowledge is organized in the brain, including those based on how humans retrieve memories, computer science principles, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model suggests that knowledge is organized into nodes representing concepts, with nodes linked based on their relatedness. For example, a node for \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley in \"Brave New World\" raises concerns about the impending dangers of technology and capitalism. Society prioritizes community over individualism and instills a pursuit of immediate happiness from birth. Citizens are pawns in a system controlled by the World Controller, who dictates a singular ideology. Analyzing the novel through Marxist lens reveals Huxley's criticisms of these systems. He employs Marxist concepts like homogenization and reification to highlight the flaws of the emerging capitalist economy. Capitalism is critiqued through the Marxist idea of false consciousness, where the common people lack understanding of their economic relationships, focused instead on personal gain due to ideological control. The conditioning of citizens, such as through hypnopædia, enforces a desire to consume and indulge, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, where one class dominates another, is evident as lower classes are unaware of their manipulation, while higher classes, like Alphas and Betas, accept their positions. Relationships in Brave New World lack depth, with characters' interactions being superficial and focused on physical attributes, suggesting that technology and capitalism stifle free will and expression. Love and extreme emotions are absent, and societal complacency indicates a capitalist-induced obedience.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for roughly two and a half years, which equates to four and a half semesters. Navigating around campus can be challenging for many, including myself. During my freshmen year, I resided in an East Halls dorm room, ironically located at the farthest eastern point of the campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traversing from Stuart Hall to classes at various locations such as the Willard building, which is centrally located, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially during bad weather, a common occurrence in State College. I talked to an alumnus who informed me that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the main campus by vast tracts of unused land. Today, this empty space has been transformed into sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services, and is now surrounded by apartments. As the campus continues to grow, the problem of mobility becomes increasingly more difficult. What is the ideal solution? On a college campus, it would be a bicycle. However, a bicycle alone cannot solve the problem. Students must utilize them, and the campus must be designed to accommodate cyclists.\n\nI discussed this with a friend who recently restarted bicycling after a several-year break. He said, \"Bikes are great. For a few years, it wasn’t trendy to ride a bike, but it's the only viable way to get around.\" Besides being good for one's health, bicycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical exertion can cover 30 miles or more. Like many of my peers, I now live off-campus, as far from the campus center as some dorms. The best decision I made this year was to buy a bike. Classes in Thomas building, roughly a 25-minute walk from my home, can be reached in just 5 minutes by bike, if pedaled quickly. The main issue is that Pollock Road, the direct route to Thomas building from my house, isn't always easy to navigate, whether by bike or on foot. While walking has its merits, I'm too busy to do so. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would add an additional 30-40 minutes to my daily routine, totaling over two and a half hours per week. Adding the time spent walking to and from other classes, appointments, and other activities, would amount to more time than I can afford."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded.

Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In my quest to become a social worker, I aim to focus on the Division of Family and Children Services, where I can assist children who have experienced abuse or neglect, and offer support to troubled families. The values I bring to the social work field are service, respect, ethical conduct, a commitment to strengthening relationships among individuals, and a dedication to continuous professional growth to stay competent. These values are not just essential for social workers; they are deeply important to me personally.\n\nMy desire to help others has been a constant throughout my life, but I was uncertain about the career path that would suit me best. Throughout high school and college, I observed many people avoiding their problems in denial and resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms. Witnessing these situations led me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Despite this, I was still uncertain about my career path, so I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009.\n\nOne summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy who was nervously sitting on her couch. She explained that he was there to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that the boy had contacted the police. I went to his parents' house to offer assistance. The police asked me to talk to the parents, and I saw that they were nervous and blamed their son for involving outsiders. This experience made me seriously consider a career in social work to help children with family disputes.\n\nSocial justice is another critical value in the field of social work. Our society claims the individual is important but often follows outdated traditions rather than embracing uniqueness. If we mourn lost individuals, why do we strive to be like everyone else? I am an individual who refuses to limit myself to fit societal norms. Throughout my years in high school and college, I challenged social injustice by coloring my hair unnaturally, wearing unique clothing, piercing my ears beyond traditional norms, joining GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and standing against racism and discrimination.\n\nI believe in social justice and will continue to resist social injustice throughout my life.",
            "This study explores the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to insomnia, addressing insomnia's biological aspects, which emphasize genetics and medical factors, and sociocultural aspects, which consider environmental influences like race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The review delves into these models, presenting and explaining the chosen research, and critiques their strengths and weaknesses. Insomnia can manifest as a primary disorder, a co-occurring mental disorder, or be related to medical conditions or substances. Primary sleep disorders are Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while those related to mental disorders are linked to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Dyssomnias involve problems with sleep initiation or maintenance, such as Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia. Parasomnias, like Nightmare Disorder or Sleepwalking Disorder, present with behavioral or physiological abnormalities. The review concentrates on insomnia and primary sleep disorders, focusing on both biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders centers on genetic factors, heritable traits, and physiological aspects. Orexin-expressing neurons in the hypothalamus regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that GABAB receptors on orexin neurons control sleep/wake states. The activation of GABAA receptors induces sleep, and their inhibition can reduce anxiety and promote sleep. The GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep duration in mice, suggesting that human sleep patterns might be influenced by this receptor. A dysfunction or absence of this receptor could impair sleep quality without medication. Socioculturally, if this phenotype is inherited, it could influence sleep regulation and negatively impact daily life, affecting areas like education, career, and tasks requiring sustained focus.",
            "This paper discusses three main aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Firstly, it offers a brief explanation of what the disorder entails. Second, it details the diagnostic process, including common indicators, or \"red flags\". Lastly, the paper concludes with strategies for teachers in mainstream classrooms to support students with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is defined as the efficiency and effectiveness with which the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. Specifically, CAP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory data within the CNS and the neurobiological activity that underpins this processing and generates electrophysiological auditory responses. Essentially, it is a condition where the brain struggles to process sounds as it should. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally, so they are not considered \"hearing impaired\"; instead, their brain's ability to interpret and distinguish sound, such as separating words or differentiating speech from background noise, is impaired.\n\nThe earliest reference to the disorder, originally called \"auditory imperception,\" dates back to the mid-1950s when researchers studied children with communication difficulties. This work led to the development of tests by the Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari in 1954, and the introduction of dichotic testing by Kimura in 1961, which formulated a model to explain the underlying physiology of the central nervous system in auditory perception. A significant national conference in 1977 further stimulated research on children with CAPD.\n\nThe symptoms of CAPD vary and can include difficulty in localizing sounds, distinguishing between multiple sounds, recognizing sound patterns, detecting changes in speech (such as sarcasm), being unable to filter out one sound when another is present, having trouble interpreting sound cues, and struggling to determine the sequence of auditory information.\n\nDiagnosis of CAPD involves a comprehensive evaluation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests that assess auditory function, which can be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals using various methods. These assessments may include questionnaires, observations of auditory behaviors, and responses to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single, universally effective diagnostic tool or known cause for the disorder. Common tests present patients with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and ask them to differentiate specific items such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to these signals.",
            "Twelfth Night suggests that while disguise can be beneficial for extended deceptions, ultimately, one must discard the assumed persona to prevent losing their true self. Discontinuing a deception can lead to isolation, as it may disrupt relationships. While some might react calmly upon discovering the deception, others could be offended, causing tension in their connections. The theme of deception in gender role reversal is particularly complex, as it raises questions about why individuals feel compelled to hide their identity. In Viola's case, her disguise as Cesario is a means of self-preservation. Arriving in a new land, she pretends to be a man to protect herself from potential threats, but this also separates her from female company, isolating her from a crucial support network. Her convincing portrayal of a man causes Olivia to fall in love with her, adding to her romantic complications. Shakespeare's characters, through their experiences with Cesario, may reveal latent emotions they had kept hidden. Olivia's transition from loving Cesario to seeing Viola as a sister suggests she was more judgmental of outward appearances than genuinely harboring feelings for women.",
            "The harshness of German colonial rule, evident in the genocides of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa, does not accurately represent the entirety of their colonial empire. German colonial rule varied vastly in its policies and administration across diverse geographical regions. Educational provision in these colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a significant population of educated and literate Africans. Similarly, the education initiatives in Kamerun and other colonies were commended by contemporary authors. In contrast, South West Africa (present-day Namibia) experienced a starkly different situation. Unlike in East Africa, where the government actively participated in the education of natives, in South West Africa, the responsibility for educating the natives was largely delegated to missionary societies with limited government support. However, the government did invest considerable resources in the education of Europeans, establishing a state school system and extensively supporting and regulating missionary schools. These policies had lasting effects on South West Africa, even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies boasted a substantial number of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to the unique experience of South West Africa. This paper aims to explore these factors and focus on new research into the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is a wealth of literature on education during the German colonial period, much of it in German and written in the early 20th century, during or immediately after the period of German colonial rule. Early works largely described the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later English writings expanded this discourse through comparative studies of education across various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects. These studies highlighted significant differences in educational systems among the colonies. Cohen’s study on education in South West Africa and East Africa is particularly notable. Cohen compares the educational systems of these two colonies and discusses the factors that account for their differences. According to Cohen, the substantial settler population in South West Africa contributes to the distinctive aspects of its educational system.\n\nCompared to other German colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately friendly climate, though much of its territory is arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected these mild conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, compared to only 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The evolution of popular music has seen an explosion in genres over the past century, making it challenging to enumerate them all. Each genre—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—has spawned numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. Among these, heavy metal rock has emerged as one of the most diverse and expressive genres within popular music over the past four decades. Its expressiveness is evident through a wide range of emotions, predominantly on the darker side. Its diversity is marked by the early recognition of the genre's flexibility, which led to the creation of various sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, with this pattern continuing to this day.\n\nToday, the heavy metal genre has evolved to encompass so many niches that defining it precisely is difficult. It has absorbed themes from other genres but has its roots somewhere. To comprehend the metal music prevalent today, one must first understand the essence of the metal movement—why it is considered a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is defined by its darker tones. It is often referred to as the \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more theatricality. Performers in metal bands exhibit advanced instrumental skills, which are evident in their music. Additionally, metal is often associated with the use of drugs, particularly during the psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70s. These substances were used to create otherworldly records, serving as a vehicle for artistic expression. The genre possesses dark, visceral qualities that were relatively new to the music scene, providing an emotional depth often lacking in popular music. Later generations of metal have drawn influence from the Romantic Era's darker and visceral qualities. Lyrics like those from Helter Skelter by The Beatles, which express the darker side of the band, illustrate this. The song was a response to The Rolling Stones' heavier and darker music and is considered one of the early heavy metal tracks.",
            "Before the Surrealists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was already crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. His 1910 painting, The Dream, is not only a depiction of a woman in awe of the wonders she encounters in her dream but also a reflection of Rousseau's own personal dreams and aspirations as an artist. Throughout his career, he dreamt of recognition, acceptance, and praise from other artists and art enthusiasts, facing an internal conflict between conforming to or mimicking established painting styles to gain acceptance or staying true to his unique creative vision. The Dream encapsulates this lifelong internal struggle.\n\nTo fully understand The Dream, we must first be aware of Rousseau's background. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval, northwest France, Rousseau's father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer. He received no formal art training but worked as a gabelou (employee of the municipal toll service), earning the nickname \"douanier\" (customs inspector) despite his lower-class background. After the deaths of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children, Rousseau turned to painting for comfort and a fresh start. Unlike his contemporaries, Rousseau did not idealize or romanticize the peasant in his art; he was a folk painter with the hopes and dreams of the common people.\n\nRousseau's desire for art-world acceptance is understandable given his context. Lacking formal training and starting his career late, he was producing works alongside prominent, better-known artists of his time. Recognition for his art began to come around the same time Matisse was building his reputation. Jan Gordon, in the book Modern French Painters, notes that while they were competitors, Matisse and Rousseau differed in their motivations: Matisse sought to avoid painting in a clichéd manner, while Rousseau yearned to paint in a conventional way to be accepted by the Artiste Français.",
            "Numerous great thinkers have posited an inherent link between ethics and aesthetics, as well as between truth and beauty. I contend that this is due to a fundamental reason. As John Keats observes in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty — That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of what we learn in life comes from education or experience, we often appreciate ethics and aesthetics without formal instruction, as Keats suggests. Both fields aim to describe rather than dictate. Our explorations of morality and beauty are primarily attempts to understand why a piece of art or literature is beautiful or why an action is moral, rather than definitive rules for evaluating or creating good art or moral behavior. Critiquing art or morality, however, often fails to fully capture what is truly good or beautiful. A discussion about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but ultimately, these don't explain why it's considered good art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often resort to phrases like \"there's just something about it\" before offering more detailed explanations. I believe that both art and morality cannot be fully reduced to descriptions of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor puts it, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” Similarly, ethics possesses this same ineffable quality. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I propose that this elusive 'something' — this je ne sais quoi — is art and morality's most potent attribute, and it is this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics that forges a connection between them. Moreover, I believe that morality and art are so interconnected because we experience them most vividly at a noumenal level, using a Kantian term. They impact us deeply, even if the reasons for this impact cannot be fully explained. This connection is even stronger when it comes to literary art. As McKean asserts, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values...Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Germany today is a powerful, unified nation, with a distinct culture that stretches from the alpine region around Munich to the Baltic Sea coast at Kiel, and from Cologne on the Rhine River to the heart of Germany, and on to the Saxon city of Dresden along the Elbe River. Given this rich cultural diversity, it's not surprising that Germany, as we know it today, is a blend of various origins and ethnic groups. The name \"Germany\" itself is of uncertain origin, with different theories suggesting it comes from the name of a Germanic tribe (the Tungrians), their use of spears, or the Old Irish word for \"shout\". Early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"On the Origin and Situation of the Germans\", described the Germans as an original, unmixed race who settled in Germany through seafaring, not immigration or mixing with other races. The Romans, while they did engage in trade and occasional campaigns in Germania, generally preferred to send their conquests there rather than themselves. As a result, the Germanic tribes living on the Roman Empire's borders traded goods and skills with the Romans, contributing to the development of what is now Germany.",
            "I gazed downwards, my mind blankly taking in the scene before me. I observed the object of study without emotion, my practiced awareness declining to connect it to any abstract understanding. Thoughts darted in and out of my mind so swiftly that it seemed I had no personal thoughts; instead, I was merely experiencing an active and fluid perception of what I was looking at. Once, following the advice of an artist I had worked with, I bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" My lifelong desire to learn to draw had driven me to this book, which teaches from understanding basic tools to the brain's processes in interpreting lines. One technique it taught was to place a square frame around any image to simplify it; for instance, a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room would become a simple bowl of fruit on a flat plane. At that moment, staring at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't imagine framing the scene. I was so overwhelmed and awestruck that I could only stand and marvel. Masters like Picasso (blue phase), Monet (greenery), and Italian Renaissance artists (rainbow of colors) had already set precedents for artistic perspective. Before me were the beginnings of my own work, the start of my story, \"Work in Brown.\" My fingers touched my chosen tool, my muscles tensing and relaxing as my hand moved through space, my mind giving form to the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled serenely and clearly, flakes of matter breaking away and disappearing. My hand struck the toilet handle again, more anxiously this time, but the offending brown package refused to budge, stuck like a slug. Grip on the mop tight, feet planted wide, a green tie uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter left as a message for bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet introspection, then my hand reached for the wall, gripped the end of the toilet paper, and began wrapping itself like an oven mitt. Standing upright, then bending at the waist, my hand slowly dipped into the bowl, like a mother preparing to retrieve a Thanksgiving turkey from the oven.",
            "Teenagers are perishing in car crashes. Multiple factors coalesce to make this a deadly trend for young American drivers. The National Institutes of Health reveal that a significant aspect of the issue is the immaturity of the teenage brain when it comes to driving dangers. Lack of experience further exacerbates the problem, leading to more fatal collisions, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and road departure incidents.\nTeens are especially vulnerable when driving with peers, which is common knowledge among those with any sense. Research by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center indicates that the age of passengers correlates with the frequency of traffic accidents.\nSeveral states, including California, have implemented temporary provisional licenses to mitigate teen driver safety, limiting driving hours and prohibiting other minors as passengers. However, these measures are insufficient as a group, as young drivers statistically struggle with the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman asserts that even at 18, teens are not ready for regular driver's licenses. Studies suggest that teens under 19-20 are inclined to take risks for the thrill, making it logical to delay driving until this tendency subsides. If we continue to grant driver's licenses to young teens, we will likely see an uptick in deadly accidents, potentially reaching alarming proportions as the current generation of teens becomes eligible to drive.\nA reasonable legislative approach would be to maintain driver's education classes in schools, blocking anyone under 18 from operating a vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued, with a required number of practical driver's training hours, based on current state standards (e.g., 6 hours in California). Since teen driving deaths are widespread, national legislation could effectively protect teens nationwide. This proposed legislation is not unprecedented.",
            "After browsing through the Library of Congress's archive of Edison's early films, I decided to watch all 15 trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films primarily use creative editing to create illusions. My analysis mainly involved describing the visual style of most trick films and exploring the unique characteristics of a few later films. Most trick films from this era are confined to a single set, using a frontal proscenium stage, with no camera movement, and feature long or medium shots, adhering to the rule that one shot equals one film. However, a few films at the start of the 20th century did break these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA common trait among these trick films is that they are shot within an interior set framed by a frontal proscenium, with the camera remaining stationary. This style, borrowed from theatre and vaudeville, limits movement to side-to-side within the frame, as seen in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). Actors enter from the side and move horizontally, never walking towards or away from the camera or having the camera follow them.\n\nLong and medium shots are common, with close-ups never being used in these trick films, reflecting the traditions of theatre and vaudeville where the entire performance was visible within the stage borders. This style also limits the dramatic or narrative potential of trick films, as they often focus on brief vaudeville-style tricks like magic or disappearing acts, with little story. Note that, despite the apparent single shot, a single \"shot\" in a trick film often consists of multiple physical shots edited together to create illusions. For instance, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a closer look reveals that the physical shot with Mary's \"severed head\" begins at a specific point, although the film is perceived as a single shot by the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate supporter of the Republican Party. His background as a farmer and brief political career shaped him into a champion of personal liberty and government reform. His deep commitment to an agrarian society informed much of his views on governance, sovereignty, and the judicial system. Taylor believed that the U.S. had the chance to establish an ideal government system due to the absence of native traditions that could hinder its creation. He held firm beliefs in the interdependence of natural rights, asserting that their denial would diminish the value of those that remain. In his view, a government should be designed to account for human nature's inherent good and evil. Taylor believed that good principles should protect private property, promote agriculture, and discourage capitalism. He thought that a government founded on such principles would function fairly regardless of its administration, which would be driven by avarice and self-interest. He also advocated for a strong, limited federal government with powers explicitly stated in the Constitution, as an extensive federal government could become corrupt and oppressive. Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defines the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, commuter log submissions sharply declined in the third month of the project. The reason behind this drop is unclear. In December, fewer people are commuting by bike or on foot due to winter, and students and faculty are busy with end-of-semester tasks and holiday preparations. The project's initial excitement might have also faded. To reignite participation, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which boosted log submissions. However, the project faced challenges, including holiday breaks and the general preference for driving. To encourage alternative commuting, we offered various prizes, such as gift cards to local businesses. Larger prizes like bicycles or hybrid/electric cars could have further increased engagement. Even increasing the value of the prizes over time might have helped maintain momentum.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a financial instrument designed to mimic an index, commodity, or a collection of assets, similar to an index fund, but with the added flexibility of trading like a stock on an exchange. ETFs offer the diversification of index funds and the advantages of individual stock ownership, such as short selling, margin purchases, and buying as few as one share. While these perks are appealing, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios than typical mutual funds. However, there are drawbacks, like the necessity of paying commissions on trades, similar to stock transactions. ETFs also offer a wide variety of funds, but it's crucial for savvy investors to assess whether these claimed benefits, like diversification, truly exist and to what extent.\n\nFor this analysis, we'll examine the ETF IHF and compare it with its top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of its assets. We'll determine if owning a single ETF can match the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of these 10 stocks, and whether there are better configurations of these stocks that could provide a higher Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo simplify the evaluation, we'll only include the top 10 holdings. We'll calculate the Beta and return of a portfolio composed of these 10 stocks, using their current asset proportions. The calculations are as follows:\n\nFrom these calculations, it's clear that a portfolio of the top 10 holdings could offer a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, with a 16% increase. Additionally, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF's. These findings suggest that a portfolio consisting of just these 10 stocks could yield a higher return with a lower Beta. However, we should also consider if these portfolios are statistically different.\n\nTo assess this, we'll determine the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% for comparison with the ETF IHF's standard deviation.",
            "Dream-land is considered one of Edgar Allan Poe's superior poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe employs the term \"Thule\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used this term to refer to an island north of Britain, considered the extremity of the known world by the Greeks. While Virgil did indeed use the term, another more contemporary source deserves credit, as Poe was particularly interested in German authors. This usage demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's work. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" highlights the similarities between their poems, concluding that Poe was imitating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was a renowned writer of the poetic drama Faust, published in two parts—the first in 1808 and the second upon his death in 1832. In the second part of Faust, there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" This poem describes a king whose wife's death after giving him a goblet leads him to drink heavily and mourn, eventually deciding to end his life by throwing the goblet into the ocean. The King of Thule's fate echoes the dark despair in \"Dream-Land,\" possibly reflecting Poe's own struggles with grief and addiction. Faust was also adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe refers to \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and uses the term \"Thule\" twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule as dark, lonely, and haunted by dead friends, resembling the state of the king in \"The King of Thule,\" who is also lonely and has lost his will to live. The entire poem reads as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe's world.\n\nGoethe was a significant author that Poe would have known, if only through his admiration for Tennyson. When asked if he admired Tennyson, Poe praised him and would have been exposed to Goethe's work through numerous reproductions following its original publication.",
            "In California, the injured customer, Jennifer Palmer, may be able to seek punitive damages if she can prove that the store manager, Paul Martin, acted with malicious intent. This would require showing that Martin knew or should have known about the potential harm of leaving the applesauce spill uncleaned for a half-hour, despite two employees having already reported it. Although Martin's actions were likely despicable, given the previous six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009, his failure to clean the spill might still warrant a punitive damage award.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, employee Rich Wayne informed Martin about the spill but was told that Martin was on dinner break and couldn't handle it. Another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, informed Martin at 5:15 pm, but again, Martin declined to address the spill. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, causing a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, there had been five similar incidents reported. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nUnder California law, punitive damages for a breach not arising from a contract can be awarded if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" If the defendant acted with ill intent to cause harm, or if their actions were despicable and willfully disregarded the safety of others, punitive damages may be justified. In this case, the court will examine whether to partially dismiss Palmer's punitive damage claim based on whether Martin's actions fit this definition.",
            "Four years ago, I enrolled in an Islam course at CBC, where the topic of whether Islam is an antagonistic religion sparked passionate debate. This question feels more pertinent today than ever. Reflecting on the post-9/11 period, I've noticed a shift in American mass media's portrayal of Islam and extremism, ranging from hostility to extreme tolerance. For instance, in 2001, a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, with apparent Muslim heritage, would have been unthinkable. The Prophet Muhammad's biography has always intrigued me, as it seems to contradict his historical portrayal. While I initially believed Muhammad forced conversions and conquered tribes, his biography depicts him as a martyr and humble figure, with converts drawn to his teachings. This portrayal shares uncanny similarities with Jesus' ministry and miracles, potentially diminishing Christ's life and miracles by attributing them to Muhammad. Furthermore, the biography relies heavily on third-party accounts, which can make the stories seem less credible. My main concern is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly, humble, and wise figure, despite historical evidence suggesting otherwise. If Muslims today knew Muhammad's true rise to power, I believe it would be challenging for them to maintain this image.",
            "The teachings and beliefs that Jesus held during his time were initially discarded in the evolution of Christian thought. If we examine this historical trajectory in a broad sense, a noticeable trend emerges: Christianity has been progressively diverging from its roots over time. Today's world is marked by an increasing awareness and a trend towards progressive ideas. While traditionalists persist and resist anything outside their learned beliefs, their influence may be limited. Among Christians, a growing historical awareness will lead to a desire to distinguish the doctrines added over time from the original intent behind Christianity. This process could take decades or even centuries, but the inevitable result will be a significant shift in Christian history. It will involve a movement that strips away layers of doctrine, as if reversing time, until only the core of Jesus' teachings remain. This trend, once it spreads across the United States and Europe, will lead to a widespread return to the worship practices and beliefs of Jesus' time. While the church as an institution will remain strong, the diversity within Christianity will decrease, with greater uniformity of belief and practice emerging. This reversal of history in the realm of Christianity is not unprecedented; after all, Christianity went from being persecuted by the Roman Empire to becoming a pillar of that empire. Similarly, our country has seen a shift from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The future will see a similar reversion in Christianity, undoing the diversity while returning to the source. A key factor in this process will be interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically rather than literally. To understand what happened after Jesus' lifetime, we need to look back to the roots of the Christian religion, which are found in Judaism. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., Judaism was characterized by monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures. However, the Jewish population at this time was not unified and was divided into various groups, including Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "Upton Sinclair's novel, The Jungle, illustrates the inherent greed and self-interest of human nature. People, by their very nature, are inclined to prioritize their own well-being and comfort, often disregarding those less fortunate. The novel demonstrates this through various aspects, particularly the factory owners and managers. Their sole objective is to expand their businesses and factories without regard for the consequences. They are indifferent to any harm caused to people or animals due to their operations. Sinclair vividly depicts the environmental destruction caused by pollution, describing the \"great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories\" and the \"river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". The workers are also subjected to harsh conditions, working long hours with little pay and no job security. The lack of worker protections or regulations during that era allowed managers and owners to exploit workers without consequence. The desperate conditions led to the formation of unions, but many were corrupt and exploited workers even further. The workers were effectively enslaved, working and living in appalling conditions, \"dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers\".",
            "Many authors employ various techniques to evoke specific impressions or attitudes in their readers' minds when addressing significant subjects. Some methods are more effective than others. In his novel The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald employs a range of these techniques. He often uses unusual adjective-noun pairings to create a certain atmosphere around a subject. Additionally, he invests symbols with meaning and employs them for the same purpose. Fitzgerald utilizes this approach with several colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald assigns special significance to white/gray and red/pink, building up their meanings and then using these meanings later to convey specific feelings about important objects.\n\nFitzgerald associates white with elegance and sophistication, while gray represents age and faded quality. He establishes this meaning with consistent use of these colors at the beginning of the novel. Daisy and Jordan are frequently “in white” (8), and most characters at Gatsby's party wear white: Nick is in “white flannels” (41), Tom wears a “white shirt” (36), and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). The only exception is when Nick observes Gatsby's party, where he describes the halls as “gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further reinforces these associations by applying white and gray to mundane subjects and people: Nick works in “white chasms” (56), party attendees have “gray names” (61), Catherine’s apartment is part of a “long white cake of apartment-houses” (28), Jordan and Daisy share a “white girlhood” (19), and there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of ashes. After imbuing white/gray with specific meanings, Fitzgerald uses them to convey feelings of unimportance or uniformity. The first instance of this is Daisy: after a long period without significant use of white or gray, she is described as “dressed in white” in a “little white roadster” (74), making her appear less distinct and more like a uniform desire for Gatsby. Fitzgerald employs this technique repeatedly around Daisy to emphasize her uniform nature. For example, her fur collar is described as a “gray haze” (18) and she wears a “white” dress (115) before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County's agricultural prowess is driven by its temperate, sunny climate, with crops like tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers thriving here. The demand for organic, locally grown produce is strong, with many community-supported agriculture initiatives boasting long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Some organic farms offer tours and recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching. This type of operation can leverage government programs to benefit both the environment and profits. Additionally, organic farming fosters greater biodiversity due to the absence of chemicals, but it also demands more labor and management to maintain yields. Furthermore, it can lack the scale efficiency of larger farms. Landowners might seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profits and habitat quality. The selected property is a 160-acre parcel in Potrero, unincorporated San Diego County, adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest, within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion. This area has a high concentration of endangered and declining species, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterflies, California gnatcatcher, and burrowing owls. Originally inhabited by Native Americans and later used for grazing and wood production, this land is now being considered for organic farming. Government programs and a nearby organic farm model were researched to explore potential cost mitigation and wildlife-friendly farming practices.",
            "Culture's impact on negotiations is substantial. Defined by what it is not, and what it signifies, culture isn't uniform or specific. Stereotypes like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are too broad and simplistic. A negotiator should focus on the cultural significance of the situation and how it influences discussions. When encountering a different culture, one naturally compares it to their own. Understanding foreign cultures involves studying history or recognizing biases, not judging or changing them. Acceptance and working within cultural boundaries are key, especially with a weaker bargaining position. Respect for traditions can help overcome cultural barriers and advance negotiations. Moreover, culture isn't limited to national identities; many companies have unique corporate cultures, evident in work hours, communication styles, and hiring practices. Some companies encourage employee philanthropy, while others limit it, highlighting the diversity within a society's culture. Cultural values, which drive behaviors, are crucial to understand. For instance, a culture valuing \"saving face\" makes public shaming unlikely, while a culture valuing hard bargains might delay settlements. Before negotiation, understanding cultural values and personal traits of opponents can enhance effectiveness.",
            "The fool has declared in their heart, 'There is no God.' This statement is initially presented in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and serves as the opening to St. Anselm's argument for the existence of God. It is also echoed by Thomas Aquinas. Since both arguments defend the same idea and we aim to compare them, we must assume they both genuinely believe in the existence of the biblical God. It would be impractical to consider any other divine entity for the purpose of this comparison. While both arguments present valid points, neither offers a comprehensive basis for believing in God.\n\nTo explore this, let's first look at St. Anselm's core argument. Anselm advocates for understanding God through faith, suggesting that proof of God's existence can be found within one's own mind. He argues that since God is a concept we can understand, we cannot logically deny his existence. Although his reasoning can be complex and unclear, his essence is that God's proof lies within our inherent self-knowledge. This is often termed 'faith' in Christian texts, where one accepts something without irrefutable empirical evidence.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, on the other hand, contends that God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, without requiring faith. This approach could be advantageous in spreading Christianity, as it would allow for conversion based on logic alone. Aquinas presents five logical arguments to support his view: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument essentially shows that the proof of God's existence lies in the logical necessity for such a being. If you have all but one piece of a puzzle, you can infer the existence and features of the missing piece by logical deduction.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a future figure known as the Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he renounced worldly desires and achieved enlightenment, giving rise to Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being its most traditional form. Now 2,500 years old, Buddhism has evolved significantly since the Buddha's time, particularly in Theravada countries like Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. Although Buddha didn't teach any religious festivities, this ceremony is observed by both monks and laypeople. The Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt and change its core beliefs due to both internal and external factors, ranging from friendly to hostile influences.\n\nThis discussion will frequently use the following terms: internal forces, which are driven by members of the Buddhist community regardless of their monastic status, and external forces, which originate from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community, while benign forces are neutral but may inadvertently assist or harm the community.\n\nFirst, let's examine the fundamental teachings of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists take refuge in the Three Jewels—the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, the teachings of the Buddha, is composed of the Tripitaka (Three Baskets) of scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Buddha's discourses, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the rules for monks and laypeople, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka explains Buddhist metaphysics, including concepts like Anatta (no self), Dukkha (suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these concepts allows one to escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and ultimately overcome desire (lobha), hatred (dosa), and delusion (moha) to achieve enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets out rules for both laypeople and monks, with laypeople following five precepts (not killing, not lying, not stealing, maintaining sexual purity, and avoiding intoxicants), while monks adhere to many more. The most crucial doctrinal tenet is the Four Noble Truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), suffering is caused by attachment, suffering can be ended, and the path to its cessation is the Middle Way.",
            "The United States and Mexico illustrate a historical rivalry that persisted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The peak of this rivalry was marked by the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States emerged victorious, acquiring Texas and the American Southwest. Various conflicts arose between the two nations throughout this period, subsiding before the onset of World War I. The rivalry stemmed from differences in religion, culture, tradition, and material interests (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31). This is not uncommon among neighboring nations that have enduring rivalries. While the United States shares geographical proximity and rivalries with Mexico and Cuba, other Latin American nations have maintained favorable relations with the United States. Religious differences, similar to those between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, were a significant factor in this rivalry. The historical distrust between the English and Spanish, inherited by their former colonies, posed significant challenges to establishing friendly relations. Diehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes during this 57-year period, most of which were territorial in nature, involving border raids and frontier issues. Schmitt (1974, p. 97) notes that the rivalry became less intense as Mexico increasingly depended on the United States, and it finally ended when American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the late 19th century (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was unexpectedly and severely disabled by a condition I had never heard of before. At the time, I was a nurse, a career choice driven by a deep need for security and stability, as I had lacked those growing up. The mantra \"There will always be work, and people will always need care\" was ingrained in me as I progressed through adolescence and into adulthood, despite my dream of becoming a scientist or journalist. However, at 46 years old, single, and with no financial savings, I was suddenly unable to work due to my disability. Now, 15 years later, I continue to live on Social Security Disability and have very little to call my own. Every day is a struggle, and my sense of security, safety, and self-esteem is constantly challenged. I've learned that while I may appear strong, true support comes from family and friends. Life's emergencies, both large and small, are inevitable, and no amount of preparation can overcome some challenges alone.\n\nI firmly believe that we, as a nation, need to stop relying solely on big government for help. While I agree with the need for self-reliance, I think we should also focus on rebuilding trust and mutual support within our communities. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies did not succeed by going it alone; they relied on cooperation and shared resources. So, while I encourage being prepared with disaster kits and supplies, I also urge you to build connections with your neighbors.",
            "The question remains: how and why do organisms evolve as they do? What constraints may influence the direction of evolutionary change? Although D'Arcy Thompson, in 1917, suggested that even the simplest organic forms are yet to be defined mathematically, recent advancements have applied mathematical modeling to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis, both in terms of ontogeny and phylogeny. Our study aims to use mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum, combined with experimental research, to understand the mechanisms behind the evolution of developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that can model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters were input into the CerioShell software. We modeled hypothetical shell forms to interpret the limits of possible morphological change in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better comprehend macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a spiral tube that evolves through 360 degrees of space. These spirals, or whorls, revolve around an imaginary central axis called the columella. The rate at which whorls expand can vary, and each whorl is separated by a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last one, known as the body whorl. The spire consists of all whorls except the last one. The top of the spire is called the apex, and the bottom is the base. The animal exits the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be examined from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. The typical orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, view the shell from the apical view and identify the first suture. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts. Count the whorls from this line, estimating a quarter whorl if necessary.\n\nShells can be considered a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal grows its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced using the coordinates of each whorl's aperture center and its horizontal and vertical radius.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical model is established, parameters can be varied to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have been relatively unchanged over the past decade. Although the nation is progressing towards achieving many Millennium Development Goals, especially in water and sanitation, the advancements in child and maternal health are insufficient to meet the 2015 targets. The reasons for these shortfalls will be explored below, indicating a need to bolster the overall health system rather than focusing on specific interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in the number of births attended by skilled health workers, reaching 72%. However, this figure still includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot provide medical interventions during complications, which is why maternal mortality due to hemorrhage remains high. This suggests that progress in this area is superficial, and there is still significant work to be done. Additionally, the percentage of children under five years old with diarrhea treated by a health professional has decreased, and postnatal care data is incomplete, indicating concerns in this area as well.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain low, at around 4%. This points to another issue: while urban areas have a c-section rate of 7%, rural areas have a rate of 2%. This disparity highlights inequities in healthcare access, with services concentrated in urban areas. Furthermore, vertical equity is a concern, as the richest and poorest quintiles differ significantly in service utilization, with a 27% gap. This disparity suggests that the poor have more difficulty accessing healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering ways to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is how to best address the lack of service. Should Indonesia focus on developing targeted program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system, without concentrating solely on pre- and post-pregnancy care? While programmatic approaches are appealing due to their targeted and manageable objectives and faster results, there are drawbacks to consider. One major concern is that investing heavily in specific health areas can lead to neglect in other sectors due to redirected funding and human resources. Moreover, running multiple parallel programs can result in service duplication, increased paperwork, and uncoordinated efforts.",
            "Victorian literature is known for its meticulous attention to detail and focus on the upper-class society of the time. Two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which incorporate mystery and the unusual into their narratives, enhancing character development and psychological depth. Both novels often use dream sequences or dreamlike states to convey this mystery, with each book employing it differently. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences provide insights into Oliver's inner turmoil, his awareness of his surroundings, and his pain. When he relives the shooting in chapter 28, it is as if in a dream, highlighting his loss of control over events and the dire state of his health. The shooting itself is overwhelming for Oliver, his senses numbed and his despair intensified. The passage suggests that Oliver's misfortunes are not of his own making, and he lacks control over his life's outcomes. His inability to react or take control reflects a growing sense of defeat, possibly due to the influence of Fagin.",
            "Two years back, I was part of an after-school program tutoring elementary-aged students. I did my best to assist them in whichever subject they were struggling with, although I excelled more in English and reading. I was approached by one of the instructors to help a young boy named Adrian, who was in third or fourth grade and having a lot of trouble reading. It soon became clear that something was off. He had peculiar issues with reading; he could pronounce some letters perfectly, while others he couldn't pronounce at all. Strangely, he was of Latino descent and spoke perfect English. We faced challenges until I met Adrian's mother. During a babysitting session (to keep the stragglers occupied), his mother walked in. She only spoke Spanish, and I, with my limited Spanish knowledge, communicated with her. It dawned on me: Adrian could read well; he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if this realization helped him, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, especially in California. It also demonstrates that the problem isn't always as apparent as we think. Even a child who speaks perfect English can struggle with reading. This is a known issue, so what's the solution? For Adrian, it was straightforward—tutoring in English reading, particularly the alphabet and pronunciation. But for many children who barely speak English, the solution is more complex. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. Combining various methods is key: dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—none alone will solve the problem.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is a valuable approach. It benefits not just children whose first language is Spanish, but all children. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. However, there's fear and misconception that it's a waste of resources and doesn't benefit the majority. This isn't accurate. If implemented as the norm rather than the exception, all children would benefit. But how do we make this happen? Requiring all teachers to be bilingual isn't realistic. Instead, we could have specialized aides or tutors who are bilingual.",
            "From childhood, many of us are introduced to the idea of something greater than ourselves, something we can't fully grasp. Some learn about this through religious instruction, while others seek answers within themselves or their families. Some readily accept these beliefs, while others reject them, claiming there's nothing beyond our own thoughts and experiences. We all have our own ways of exploring spirituality, searching for meaning and light in the darkness. \"A cardinal,\" my father said in response to my question about his favorite bird. We were sitting on our front porch, listening to the rain, smoking. He was thinner, his clothes loose, his hair thin. He gazed into the rain, almost lost in thought.

I hugged him, moved my chair closer, and looked out into the rain with him.\n\nMy father passed away in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The treatments had prolonged his suffering but not eased it. What was the purpose of enduring more pain and time? I wondered if God had stopped caring about me. I didn't pray. I couldn't bear to watch him die, so I stayed away. I wanted to remember him by his life, not his death. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for news. No one called me.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, as Ian Watt describes in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, essentially an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New',\" blending old and new elements. The Gothic genre has been both criticized and admired, described as having little depth and praised for its ability to evoke a 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The original Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, combined elements of old and modern romances to establish the proto-Gothic genre and a new method of storytelling. Walpole employed old theatrical elements and new representations of nature within modern novels to create what he termed \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre draws heavily from medieval Gothic theater, architecture, and traditions. Even in Walpole's time, the term \"Gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and time periods, often negatively, as archaic or unsophisticated compared to modern advancements. The fusion of traditional Gothic elements and the new, personal perspective of the novel contributed to Gothic's enduring popularity and its ability to seem both outdated and fresh to readers removed from the original time period.\n\nOne prominent theme in Gothic novels is chivalry, a medieval concept representing proper knightly training. In The Castle of Otranto, chivalry is both preserved and reimagined. Gothic authors, like Walpole, valued chivalry for its symbolism of bravery, honor, and competence, traits they felt were lacking in contemporary society. By incorporating chivalric elements and ideals, Walpole romanticized the \"gothic past\" and hinted at the future evolution towards Romanticism. Writing during a politically turbulent time, Walpole, amidst political turmoil and personal accusations, may have felt that the moral goodness and innate virtue of the Gothic era had been lost in modern society. This is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, including being a prince, suffering from tragedy, and being believed killed by infidels. His description exaggerates the trope of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves the series of steps for moving products from customer orders through raw materials, supply, production, and distribution to the final customer. The concept of supply chain management was introduced by Keith Oliver in 1982. It encompasses the planning, execution, and control of activities within the supply chain to meet customer needs swiftly and efficiently. Six key elements make up a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers employ these elements to deliver superior customer service.\n\nProduction is the initial step in the supply chain process. It is the cornerstone of the supply chain. Here, managers define the timing, purpose, location, and method of production. To understand customer needs, managers analyze the market as it is the primary indicator of customer demand. After assessing the market and understanding demand, managers decide which products to produce and in what quantities. They then choose the optimal location for production, considering volume and quality while ensuring customer satisfaction. Following this, managers focus on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. Production is crucial in the supply chain, requiring meticulous planning; neglecting details can lead to significant time and cost inefficiencies. For instance, companies like Wal-Mart and Target have detailed policies for every aspect of their operations, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments, ensuring smooth and confusion-free processes.\n\nThe second key element in supply chain management is supply. Supply involves strategic decisions about a facility's core capabilities and outsourcing relationships. A company might have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with unique equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must determine which division is best suited for each product's processes. Managers might also opt to outsource work to other companies, primarily to achieve quicker delivery times, improve flexibility, and reduce costs.",
            "A sign in Burma, which is also known as Myanmar, reads \"Hitler is alive.\" Ellen Page, the actor from the movie \"Juno,\" stands alone on a street corner holding a cardboard sign with this message written in Sharpie. Burma is a Southeast Asian country ruled by a military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, the country experienced street protests for the first time in a decade, led by monks, which earned the nickname \"The Saffron Revolution.\" The protests initially involved peaceful gatherings but escalated into violent conflicts between the monks and the government. The government cracked down on foreign journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai who was killed for being at a protest. The official death toll is 13, but a defected colonel suggests that many more people have been killed. This is not an isolated incident; similar atrocities have occurred throughout history, such as the Tiananmen Square protests, the Rwandan genocide, and Nazi Germany's persecution of Jews.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence on jazz music is largely due to his long career and his ability to direct his orchestra creatively. While Ellington's piano playing is often subtle in the compositions chosen for this assignment, he excelled as a composer in creating intricate pieces that highlighted the unique skills of his band members. He designed structures for soloists to improvise, wrote carefully orchestrated passages, and tailored his arrangements to suit each musician's style, fostering a cohesive and innovative sound. Ellington's mastery of individual players' voices and their collective ensemble sound enabled him to produce many groundbreaking jazz pieces.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary describes Ellington's sound and innovation, mentioning \"Creole Love Call\" as a notable example. In this piece, Ellington uses the voice as a jazz instrument to add texture and color. This technique, seen throughout his career, is exemplified in \"Creole Love Call,\" where the voice transitions between smooth and rough sounds and interacts with reeds, brass, and other instruments in a structured call-and-response pattern. The piece features six choruses, each with distinct solos and arrangements, showcasing Ellington's ability to complement his soloists' styles.\n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington demonstrates his skill in tight orchestration and tonal versatility. A call-and-response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing combines vocal elements of Miley's playing with instrumental qualities of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" builds on these ideas, as Ellington effectively uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone to introduce the melody, further emphasizing his approach to tone color and orchestration.",
            "She had always felt a persistent longing for something, a desire that remained unfulfilled. This sensation began when she was 14, around the time she entered her teenage years, and continued into her 17th year. By then, she had decided she wanted a person rather than an object, but no boy caught her interest. Several had shown attraction, attempted to woo her, but none seemed appealing. She often wondered about this peculiar situation, trying to understand what could cause such a reaction in a teenage girl. After years of contemplating, she had no satisfying theories.

            "This research aimed to demonstrate that sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", is linked to a reduced risk of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, and a lower risk of dying from stroke. The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet, emphasizing more plant-based foods such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, and replacing saturated fats with monounsaturated fats and fish. It also allows for moderate alcohol consumption. Previous studies have shown that following the Med diet is associated with a lower risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, and trials have found it more effective than a low-fat diet for weight loss and improving cholesterol levels in overweight individuals. However, prior research did not focus specifically on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, without a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. Over six periods from 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score based on self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) that assessed nutrient intake over the previous year. More than 95% of nurses continued participating throughout the 20-year period. FFQ data was validated. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. Cases without available records were classified as \"probable\" and included, representing about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of postmenopausal hormones were also considered, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo account for individual variability and represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed scores from repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for potential confounding factors such as age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the association between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke was assessed, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a decreased risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (including fatal CHD and strokes) were recorded. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a severe financial collapse. There was a surge in unemployment, a crack in the housing market, and many of the country's major corporations found themselves in ruins. This economic downturn continues to this day, necessitating questions about its origins and how to prevent such an event from happening again. In essence, the crisis was engineered by self-centered and naive political decisions that coerced banks and corporations into offering sub-prime loans to an ill-prepared and insufficient financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to back and repackage these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted, banks found themselves short on capital reserves and passed the chaos onto the repackaged mortgages, which in turn affected the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of the financial crisis were planted in 1999, during the Clinton administration's pursuit of a second term. To boost his popularity, Clinton eased lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times warned in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, faced increasing pressure from the Clinton administration to broaden mortgages to low- and moderate-income individuals, and from shareholders to maintain profit growth.\" He foresaw the inevitable consequences: \"However, the government-sponsored corporation might struggle in an economic downturn, potentially requiring a government bailout like the one for the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" This foreshadowed the repercussions of the imprudent lending practices.\n\nMultiple factors conspired to send the economy into a spin. Among them was the new, complex mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely utilized in the years preceding the crisis, further interlinking various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This increased households' and financial markets' exposure to the housing market, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nThe housing bubble burst, leaving financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities in distress. In 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, representing around 30% of the U.S. GDP. Consequently, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dissolved, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to convert into commercial banks under strict regulation. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Exposition in storytelling can be both a joy and a burden. It's where you flex your writing muscles, captivating readers with powerful, spellbinding prose. However, it can also be the part of your story that sends readers to sleep or prompts them to hit the \"Back\" button. Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her screen when she encounters \"Too Much Information\" that isn't engaging.\n\nExposition, while a crucial part of storytelling, is often a challenge. The common adage \"Show, don't tell\" rings true, yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself falling into lengthy passages that lack action or, worse, provide excessive detail. Essentially, exposition is the voice in your head urging you to share background information quickly to move the story forward.\n\nIn literature, exposition involves relaying past events in straightforward language. In movies, it typically occurs when one character explains a significant chunk of information to another. The author, in this case, is the one doing the telling.\n\nConsider this example: While reading a story, you find out that the protagonist met her love interest at a specific time and place, they got married in a grand ceremony, and her spouse was killed in front of her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire backstory to be told over two pages with only a few lines of dialogue between the couple. You'd expect the author to delve into the husband's character, demonstrating his deep love for his wife through his words and actions. Similarly, you'd expect the heroine to show how her husband's presence enriched her life, providing insights into her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams. This detailed introduction would help you emotionally connect with the husband's fate and understand the heroine's character better.\n\nIn essence, you must provide substance to the skeleton of your story, such as \"They met, they married, he died.\" As a writer, you must resist the urge to rush through these details. It's tempting to quickly introduce a new character with a mundane list of facts, like being in the Air Force, running a gas station, having a certain dietary preference, or secret dreams. Instead, weave these details into the narrative to create a compelling character profile.",
            "I caught two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, which was live this morning (August 13, 2011), was from NBC 4. The headline story featured a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife (they didn't mention her name). He was arrested, and they showed his mug shot, which was quite disturbing. The story only received about two minutes of coverage, which seemed appropriate given it was still developing. The next story was about an 18-year-old man named Travis Buyers who was shot in the Sharon Woods area and critically injured. There were no arrests at the time, and the SWAT team was investigating. This story seemed brief, and I believe that might be due to the fact that Buyers is a minority. I've noted this trend over the years: minority victims of crime often receive less media attention than white victims. The next story discussed a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, which was determined to be a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest. Another news item was about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus, where a dark-skinned black man in a hoodie sweatshirt was reported to have robbed the store. The coverage seemed to emphasize his race and physical description more than usual. The final story was about a convicted Texas drug kingpin, Rene Rodriguez, who had been sentenced to 300 months (or 25 years) in prison for conspiring to distribute marijuana. They also mentioned his Hispanic background, which I didn't find particularly relevant to the story.",
            "There exists an unyielding, indissoluble bond between brothers. This bond is a complex web of feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, among others. Brothers comprehend each other on a level no one else can, and they see themselves reflected in their sibling. In times of crisis, the essence of this bond becomes apparent, whether it manifests positively or negatively. When these emotions surface, they carry significant consequences. Recognizing the emotions that stem from this fraternal bond means grappling with the repercussions they bring. When one looks into their brother's eyes, they see their own true self, not how others perceive them. Their true nature is revealed in their actions and the outcomes of those actions. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers examine this theme and the intense emotions that accompany it. In a detailed, vibrant setting, these two boys embark on a hopeless journey. In the climax, bitterness and intense pride collide, and only one brother survives. The theme is conveyed through the direct depiction of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which showcases the intricate feelings experienced by the protagonist and their worldview, both of which greatly influence their actions. The protagonist's actions are driven by a primary emotion: pride. From their initial outing to their fateful final journey, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He desired a brother he could teach various skills, like holding his breath, running, jumping, or navigating Old Woman Swamp. He yearned for a brother who could join him in races to Horsehead Landing or perch with him in the top fork of a great pine behind the barn. However, Doodle's fragile heart made it near impossible for him to participate in such activities. The reality was a harsh blow to the young protagonist's dreams. He even considered murdering the child by suffocating him with a pillow, yet his heart softened when Doodle smiled at him. This simple act gave the protagonist hope and revealed that his resolve to harm Doodle was not strong. Deep down, he held a natural affection for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex and creative information processor. As technology has evolved from primitive to advanced, the metaphors used to describe the brain have also evolved. Initially, the brain was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. It's important to keep in mind that these metaphors, while useful, can also lead to erroneous conclusions.\n\nThe brain's information processing begins with sensory organs transforming physical stimuli, such as touch, heat, sound waves, or light, into electrochemical signals. This information is then processed in both bottom-up and top-down ways. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines simple details like color, orientation, and border changes to identify the object. Top-down processing uses previous decisions to speed up object recognition. For example, it can help identify a black box rather than a black hole.\n\nOnce information is processed, an attention filter decides its importance and which cognitive processes should access it. For instance, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually, but you might pick out your name in a noisy room. There are multiple processing stages, and attention repeatedly modulates the results.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it must first store it. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Information is encoded in various ways depending on the type of stimuli. Verbal input can be encoded structurally (appearance of the word), phonemically (sound of the word), or semantically (meaning of the word). Once stored, information must be maintained. Working memory, which stores information for about 20 seconds, is maintained by looping electrical signals through specific neurons. Long-term memory is believed to be maintained by the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are many models explaining how knowledge is organized in the brain, including those based on how humans retrieve memories, computer science principles, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model suggests that knowledge is organized into nodes representing concepts, with nodes linked based on their relatedness. For example, a node for \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley in \"Brave New World\" raises concerns about the impending dangers of technology and capitalism. Society prioritizes community over individualism and instills a pursuit of immediate happiness from birth. Citizens are pawns in a system controlled by the World Controller, who dictates a singular ideology. Analyzing the novel through Marxist lens reveals Huxley's criticisms of these systems. He employs Marxist concepts like homogenization and reification to highlight the flaws of the emerging capitalist economy. Capitalism is critiqued through the Marxist idea of false consciousness, where the common people lack understanding of their economic relationships, focused instead on personal gain due to ideological control. The conditioning of citizens, such as through hypnopædia, enforces a desire to consume and indulge, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, where one class dominates another, is evident as lower classes are unaware of their manipulation, while higher classes, like Alphas and Betas, accept their positions. Relationships in Brave New World lack depth, with characters' interactions being superficial and focused on physical attributes, suggesting that technology and capitalism stifle free will and expression. Love and extreme emotions are absent, and societal complacency indicates a capitalist-induced obedience.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for roughly two and a half years, which equates to four and a half semesters. Navigating around campus can be challenging for many, including myself. During my freshmen year, I resided in an East Halls dorm room, ironically located at the farthest eastern point of the campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traversing from Stuart Hall to classes at various locations such as the Willard building, which is centrally located, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially during bad weather, a common occurrence in State College. I talked to an alumnus who informed me that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the main campus by vast tracts of unused land. Today, this empty space has been transformed into sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services, and is now surrounded by apartments. As the campus continues to grow, the problem of mobility becomes increasingly more difficult. What is the ideal solution? On a college campus, it would be a bicycle. However, a bicycle alone cannot solve the problem. Students must utilize them, and the campus must be designed to accommodate cyclists.\n\nI discussed this with a friend who recently restarted bicycling after a several-year break. He said, \"Bikes are great. For a few years, it wasn’t trendy to ride a bike, but it's the only viable way to get around.\" Besides being good for one's health, bicycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical exertion can cover 30 miles or more. Like many of my peers, I now live off-campus, as far from the campus center as some dorms. The best decision I made this year was to buy a bike. Classes in Thomas building, roughly a 25-minute walk from my home, can be reached in just 5 minutes by bike, if pedaled quickly. The main issue is that Pollock Road, the direct route to Thomas building from my house, isn't always easy to navigate, whether by bike or on foot. While walking has its merits, I'm too busy to do so. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would add an additional 30-40 minutes to my daily routine, totaling over two and a half hours per week. Adding the time spent walking to and from other classes, appointments, and other activities, would amount to more time than I can afford."
