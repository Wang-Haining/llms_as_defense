            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "This document examines the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to insomnia. The Biological model centers on inherited genetic factors and medical aspects of health. Sociocultural models, on the other hand, explore environmental influences related to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The ensuing review evaluates insomnia and other primary sleep disorders through these models, explaining each selected study and critiquing its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified as primary, secondary to another mental disorder, or resulting from other health issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while those linked to mental disorders are associated with Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorders may be due to medical complications or substance use. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and unspecified Dyssomnias. Primary Insomnia is characterized by difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia involves challenges in staying awake. Narcolepsy involves symptoms like cataplexy or automatic REM sleep. Parasomnias are characterized by behavioral abnormalities or physiological events during sleep, including Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and unspecified Parasomnias. Sleep disorders related to mental disorders involve sleep difficulties associated with clinical (Axis I) or personality (Axis II) disorders.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genes, inherited traits, and physiological aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study using mice discovered that GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are responsible for sleep-wake states. Activation of GABAA receptors promotes sleep, while inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. Baclofen, a GABAB agonist, increased sleep duration in the study. This suggests that findings from animal models can be generalized to humans, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for GABAB receptors. Impairments in these receptors could hinder adequate sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if the genetic trait is inherited, it could influence sleep, and alterations in the receptor could disrupt sleep, negatively impacting daily life activities.",
            "This paper examines three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD). Firstly, it provides a concise definition of the disorder. Secondly, it outlines the diagnostic process, including common signs, or \"red flags\". Finally, it offers suggestions for how teachers in inclusive classrooms can support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) refers to the efficiency and effectiveness of the central nervous system (CNS) in utilizing auditory information. Specifically, (C)AP involves the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the underlying neurobiological activity that generates electrophysiological auditory potentials. In essence, it is a condition where the brain cannot properly process what is heard. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally but struggle with separating words or distinguishing conversations from background noise.\n\nThe earliest reference to the condition, initially called \"auditory imperception,\" dates back to the mid-1950s when researchers were studying children with communication disorders. The Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing diagnostic tests in 1954, while Kimura introduced dichotic testing in 1961 to explain the physiological basis of dichotic perception. A national conference in 1977 further stimulated research on CAPD.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways: individuals may have difficulty localizing or hearing sounds in space, discriminating between multiple sounds, recognizing sound patterns, differentiating changes in speech (such as detecting sarcasm from tone changes), having sounds blocked by subsequent sounds, synthesizing sound clues meaningfully, or determining the sequence of auditory information. Diagnosis of CAPD involves systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function, which can be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others. There is no single test or tool that consistently identifies CAPD, and its cause is unknown. Many diagnostic tests present patients with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and ask them to differentiate specific items, such as words or numbers. Advanced tests record acoustic signals within the ear and measure responses.",
            "In \"Twelfth Night,\" it appears that while disguise can aid in maintaining prolonged deception, ultimately, one must discard this new persona or risk losing their true identity. Disclosing a lie can also lead to estrangement. Therefore, individuals must choose between self-preservation or maintaining relationships with others. While some may respond calmly to being deceived, others may be offended. The topic of gender role reversal in deception raises complex issues, particularly the question of why one might feel compelled to adopt the other gender's appearance. In Viola's case, it serves as a means of self-defense in a foreign land: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249) Her plan succeeds, but she becomes isolated from women, cutting off an important support system. Furthermore, she inadvertently attracts romantic feelings from Olivia, who mistakes her for Sebastian. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) Viola also grapples with suppressed romantic feelings towards Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261) While this can be seen as progressive, modern readers might interpret Twelfth Night as a depiction of how deception can reveal hidden emotions, especially in Olivia and Orsino. Passages suggest that these characters may harbor unexpressed subconscious desires forced to the surface by Viola/Cesario's presence. For example, Olivia's love for Cesario could be due to his male appearance, or it might reveal deeper feelings towards women. However, it's likely that Olivia's attraction to Cesario is more about appearances, as Shakespeare's characters often judge based on looks. This is evident in Olivia's swift shift from loving Cesario to regarding Cesario/Viola as family rather than a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "German colonial rule has been widely recognized for its harshness, particularly in regard to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. While it's impossible to summarize an entire colonial empire so simplistically, the German colonial empire exhibited a remarkable diversity in its policies and administration, as well as in its educational approaches. Educational systems varied greatly across colonies. When the British took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a considerable number of educated and literate Africans. German educational initiatives in Cameroon and other colonies were also commended by contemporary authors. The contrast in South West Africa (now Namibia) was stark. Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a key role in the education of natives, in South West Africa, the task of educating natives was largely left to missionary societies that received minimal government support. The government did invest heavily in the education of Europeans, setting up a system of state schools and providing more support and regulation for missionary schools. These policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies had significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Numerous social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience in South West Africa. This paper aims to broaden the discussion by identifying these factors and focusing on new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities toward native Africans.\n\nThere is a substantial body of literature about education in the German colonial empire, much of it in German and written either during or shortly after the colonial era. Earlier works mainly aimed to describe the educational systems in these colonies, while later works, often in English, expanded the discourse through comparative studies and in-depth analyses. These studies highlighted the differences in educational systems across colonies. The most notable work addressing this topic is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors accounting for their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa explains many of the unique aspects of its educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial territories, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of it is covered by arid desert. This climate was reflected in a European population that was relatively hospitable, with nearly 15,000 whites in South West Africa by 1913, compared to around 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has expanded significantly over the past century, encompassing numerous genres that are hard to enumerate exhaustively. This complexity is further compounded by the fact that many of these genres, such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have spawned numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. In particular, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has emerged as one of the most diverse and expressive genres in Popular Music over the last 40 years. Its expressiveness stems from its broad emotional range, which often leans towards darker hues. Additionally, the genre's flexibility has led to the creation of numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, creating a continuous chain of evolution. Today, the heavy metal scene is so fragmented that it's challenging to define what constitutes heavy metal, as it has absorbed themes from various other genres. To grasp the contemporary metal music scene, one must first understand the metal movement's origins and its nature as a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nHeavy metal, in many respects, is defined by its darkness. It can be seen as \"music with more\" — more bass, more volume, more aggression, and more theatricality. It emphasizes instrumental prowess, with musicians demonstrating their proficiency. Moreover, metal has a strong association with drug use, particularly psychedelic drugs in the 1970s, which allowed musicians to explore more extreme, otherworldly sounds. This genre possesses dark, visceral qualities, which was unusual for popular music at the time, as it strayed from more upbeat themes. Later generations of metal musicians have drawn inspiration from these dark, visceral qualities, which are reminiscent of the Romantic Era. Lyrics like those from \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles exemplify this darkness and are considered one of the early Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song and marked The Beatles' attempt to match the Stones' heavier, darker sound on their album \"The White Album\".",
            "Several years before Surrealist artists began creating their dream-like works, Henri Rousseau was already crafting his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. \"The Dream,\" a 1910 painting by the renowned Post-Impressionist artist, showcases not only a woman enchanted by the wonders of a dream landscape but also Rousseau's personal dreams and ambitions as an artist. Throughout his career, Rousseau yearned for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet he faced a challenging internal conflict: to conform to or imitate established painting styles to gain acceptance in the critical art world or to retain his creative independence and uniqueness. \"The Dream\" embodies Rousseau's lifelong internal struggle. Prior to examining \"The Dream\" through this lens, one should be familiar with Rousseau's biography. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Rousseau's father ran a successful tinsmith and hardware business. He lacked formal art training but worked as a gabelou (employee of the municipal toll service) until age forty, earning the nickname douanier (customs inspector). After the deaths of his wife and infant children, Rousseau turned to painting for solace and new beginnings. Unlike his contemporaries, Rousseau was a folk painter, echoing the hopes and dreams of the common people. Understanding Rousseau's desire for artistic acceptance is not surprising given his lack of formal training, late start, and the presence of many esteemed artists working concurrently. While he and Matisse were rivals in the art world, they differed in painting styles, subjects, and motivations. According to Jan Gordon in \"Modern French Painters,\" Matisse feared painting tritely, whereas Rousseau aimed to create something conventional enough to gain admission into the Artiste Français.",
            "Many prominent thinkers have proposed a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, and truth and beauty. I contend that this connection has a fundamental reason. John Keats, in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" asserts that \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of our knowledge comes from education or experience, we intuitively appreciate ethics and aesthetics without formal teaching. Both ethics and aesthetics seek to describe rather than prescribe. Our analyses of morality and beauty are primarily attempts to explain the reasons behind something's beauty or morality, not to dictate rules for creating good art or moral behavior. Critiquing art or morals can't fully capture their essence. For instance, discussing the worth of Da Vinci's Mona Lisa may involve aspects like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't explain why it's good art. Often, when discussing a favorite piece of art or literature, we hear phrases like, \"There's just something about it\" before delving into more complex explanations. Both art and morality cannot be fully reduced to descriptions of their qualities, as there's always a transcendent element, as Flannery O'Connor and Wittgenstein suggest. I believe this shared transcendent nature binds ethics and aesthetics together. I posit that we experience both morality and art most potently in a way that's ineffable, or beyond explanation, at a noumenal level. This is especially true for literature, which uniquely combines moral quality with its aesthetic appeal, as McKean observes.",
            "Germany today is recognized as a powerful and unified nation, with a distinctive culture that varies from the alpine region of Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel, and from Cologne along the Rhine River to the central region and the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. This cultural diversity is not surprising given that Germany has evolved from a mix of different tribes and sources. The land of Germania, the ancestral home of the Germans, has an uncertain origin. Some scholars suggest it comes from the Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before crossing the Rhine and fighting against Gallic forces, as noted by Tacitus in AD 98. Others propose that the name derives from the German weapon, the ger, or from the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans' loud nature. The early Roman historian Tacitus, in his writings, argued that the Germans were indigenous and had not mixed with other races through immigration or contact. He described Germany as a place with harsh conditions, which might not attract immigrants from more hospitable climates like Asia, Africa, or Italy. The Romans primarily traded with the Germanic tribes, with occasional military campaigns, but mostly returned home to their empire. As Germanic tribes began appearing in the first century, they lived on the Roman Empire's borders, trading their goods and skills within the Roman army.",
            "I gazed down, my mind empty, observing the scene before me. Impassively, silently, with a practiced detachment that analyzed the picture without connecting to any abstract understanding, my mind processed the image. Thoughts flickered through my mind, but they were ephemeral and fleeting, like a quick and smooth flow of consciousness. I couldn't relate to the picture as an artist would, but rather experienced it as a passive observer. I had always wanted to draw, and I had once bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" which taught everything from understanding a pencil to how the brain interprets lines. One technique it taught was to frame a square around a picture to simplify it, turning a complex scene into a manageable one. Looking at the bowl of fruit in front of me, I couldn't mentally frame the picture. I was too overwhelmed, too awestruck to process it. I was standing at the beginning of what could be my artistic journey, my \"Work in Brown.\" My hand touched the brush, muscles tensed and relaxed as I moved it through space, giving form to my thoughts. Water swirled smoothly, clear and clean. Small bits of matter broke away, floating away. Flush after flush, I struggled to dislodge the stubborn brown package. Frustrated, I gripped the mop and began to wrap it around my hand like a glove. Standing tall, I slowly dipped my hand into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Teenagers are dying in car accidents at an alarming rate due to a combination of factors. The National Institutes of Health point out that a key issue is the immaturity of the teenage brain, which is not yet fully capable of handling the hazards of driving. Lack of experience also plays a significant role, leading to more crashes, rollovers, speeding incidents, and off-road accidents. Teenagers are particularly at risk when they drive with peers, as studies have shown a correlation between the number of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents.\n\nSeveral states have tried to enhance teen driver safety by implementing provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and forbid minors as passengers. However, these measures are considered temporary solutions. The underlying problem is that, statistically, young drivers are not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities that come with driving. Psychology research suggests that even at 18, teens might not be mature enough to drive safely. The risk-taking tendency among teens under 19-20 years old is another concern. By 2010, the Baby Boomer generation's children will be old enough to drive, adding millions of new teen drivers to the roads.\n\nA reasonable solution would involve schools continuing to offer driver's education classes but prohibiting anyone under 18 from driving a vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued before granting a full driver's license, along with a certain number of required driving practice hours. These hours could be based on current state requirements, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Nationwide legislation would be a practical and effective way to protect teen drivers across the country, as the problem affects all states.",
            "Upon perusing the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all the trick films, numbering fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films employ creative editing to create illusions. My analysis primarily focused on detailing the poetics of most trick films and identifying unique characteristics in a few of the later ones. Generally, these films are confined to a set, staged within a frontal proscenium, with no camera movement, using long and medium shots, and adhering to the one-shot-per-film rule. However, a few films from the early 20th century challenge these norms by incorporating elements like multiple shots.\n\nOne common feature among trick films is their indoor setting, framed within a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, not moving to track figures or objects. This style was prevalent in early films and drew inspiration from theatre and vaudeville. One limitation is that figures in trick films usually move side-to-side, without moving towards or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move back and forth horizontally, without the camera following them out of frame.\n\nThis frontal proscenium setup leads to long and, less frequently, medium shots, with close-ups never occurring in any Edison trick film. This technique, like the theatre and vaudeville tradition, allows the audience to see the entire performance at once, framed by the stage borders. Actors do not move towards the camera, so close-ups are absent.\n\nMost early trick films follow the rule that one conceptual shot equates to one film, restricting their length to about a minute or less. This also limits their dramatic or narrative potential, with most focusing on simple vaudeville-style tricks like magic and disappearing acts. However, a single conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes may not correspond to a single physical shot. For instance, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a closer look reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" starts, despite the film being conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor from Caroline was an early and passionate advocate for the Republican cause. Primarily an agriculturalist, his background and brief political career shaped him into a staunch defender of personal liberties and government oversight. His commitment to agrarianism informed his views on governance, including issues of sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judiciary. Taylor believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to establish a perfect system due to the lack of traditional barriers, allowing for self-government. He held that natural rights are interconnected and should be beyond government control to maintain their full value. He contended that in a civilized society, power should not rest with the strongest or most cunning. Taylor advocated for a government that accounts for the inherent goodness and evil in humans, adhering to a dualistic morality. He viewed good principles as those that safeguard property, enhance agriculture, and curb capitalism. He believed that self-interest, while natural in humans, becomes harmful when it leads to societal exploitation. He argued for a limited federal government, with no powers beyond those explicitly stated in the Constitution, to avoid despotism and corruption. He also considered the Declaration of Independence the true foundation of the United States, as it more clearly defines the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "In Figure 17, we noticed a sharp decrease in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. The reason behind this drop is unclear, but it could be attributed to the start of winter in New England, which often leads to fewer people commuting by bicycle or on foot. Additionally, December is typically a busy time for students and faculty, as it marks the end of the fall semester and the holiday season. This could have caused the commuter log to be overlooked. Furthermore, the month-long break for students and faculty due to the holiday season and the resumption of classes in late January might also explain the low number of submissions. It's possible that the project experienced an initial surge in enthusiasm that naturally declined. To counteract this trend, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which led to an increase in log submissions. However, maintaining project momentum was challenging due to both natural decreases in engagement and the impact of holiday and semester breaks. Another obstacle was the cultural preference for driving cars, so offering incentives for alternative commuting modes was crucial. We provided various prizes, such as gift certificates to local businesses and even larger prizes like bicycles or hybrid/electric cars. The value of the prizes could have been increased over time to potentially boost participation even more.",
            "An ETF (exchange-traded fund) is a type of security that was developed to mirror an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund, but it trades more flexibly like a stock on an exchange. ETFs offer the diversification of index funds and the perks of individual stock ownership, such as the ability to short sell, use margin, and buy as few as one share per trade. Despite these advantages, ETFs typically have lower expense ratios than mutual funds. However, they do come with a trade-off: you have to pay a commission for each ETF trade, just like you would for a stock. Additionally, ETFs are known for their wide range of available funds. It's beneficial for investors to assess whether the claimed benefits, such as diversification, actually exist and to what degree. For this analysis, we will examine the IHF ETF and its top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the total assets, to evaluate if owning a single ETF could provide benefits similar to owning a diversified portfolio of the top 10 stocks, and if there are configurations that offer better risk-return ratios. To streamline our analysis, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings. The table below lists these holdings and their respective percentages of total assets.\n\nTo gauge how well these top 10 stocks represent the IHF ETF, we will calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consists of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF's holdings. The calculations for Beta and return are shown in the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, it's clear that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, an increase of 16%. Additionally, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is lower by 0.12 than that of the entire ETF. Based on these results, a portfolio of the top 10 holdings could potentially offer a higher return with a lower risk (Beta). However, statistical differences between the two portfolios remain uncertain.\n\nTo further evaluate the statistical differences between the two portfolios, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation against that of the IHF ETF.",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is one of Edgar Allan Poe's self-proclaimed best poems. In this work, Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott links to Virgil. Virgil used the term to refer to an island north of Britain, seen by the Greeks as the farthest known world. While Virgil indeed used the term, another more recent source may have influenced Poe. Poe was particularly interested in German authors.\n\nThe quote is notable for demonstrating Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writing. Karl J. Arndt, in \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" points out the similarities between Poe's and Goethe's poems, concluding that Poe was likely imitating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned writer of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. In the second part of Faust, there's a short poem called \"The King of Thulé,\" about a king who loses his wife after receiving a goblet from her. Driven by grief to drink, he eventually decides to end his life and throw the goblet into the sea. The king's fate echoes the desolation and grief found in \"Dream-Land.\"\n\nPoe mentions Thule twice in his works, including \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" In \"Dream-Land,\" he uses the term twice as bookends for the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thulé as dark and lonely, haunted by dead friends, and devoid of color—a representation of Poe's own feelings of loss and despair over drinking. The poem reads as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe's world.\n\nGoethe was a significant author whose works Poe would have known, possibly due to his admiration for Tennyson. When asked about Tennyson, Poe expressed his admiration. Additionally, Poe would have been exposed to Goethe's work through various reproductions following the original publications.",
            "According to California law, could a customer injured by falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store win punitive damages by proving the store manager acted maliciously, knowing the spill was dangerous but not addressing it for half an hour to finish his dinner?\n\nA judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages outright. To win such damages, she must show the store manager's actions were deliberate and showed a disregard for the risk of harm, as well as that the actions were particularly egregious. Palmer can argue that the manager should have cleaned the spill promptly to prevent further injuries, given that multiple customers had previously slipped and fallen due to spills. While her argument that the manager's inaction was despicable may not be overwhelmingly convincing, it is still reasonable given that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in the store in 2009, and the manager did not take sufficient action to ensure customer safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee named Rich Wayne informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin responded that he was on his dinner break and couldn't deal with the issue. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also reported the spill to Martin, who responded similarly. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Before Palmer's accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for both compensatory and punitive damages, and we are considering whether to file a summary judgment motion against the punitive damages claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can obtain punitive damages for a non-contractual breach if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that either intended to cause harm or, if there was no such intent, was \"despicable\" and was done with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Id. at § (c)(1). Courts have deemed conduct malicious when the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of their actions and willfully failed to avoid them. Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "Around four years ago, I took an Islam class at CBC. Our class frequently debated whether Islam is a hostile religion, and that question seems more pertinent now than ever. Reflecting on events since 9/11, I've noticed a shift in the U.S. media's portrayal of Islam and extremists, from hostility to extreme tolerance. In 2001, it's unlikely we would have seen a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with an evident Muslim background in his family. The Prophet Muhammad's biography intrigues me because it seems to conflict with the historical accounts of his personality. Traditionally, I believed Muhammad forced converts to Islam through conquest, but the biography portrays him as a humble prophet misunderstood by others, who one by one came to acknowledge his teachings. The similarities between Jesus' ministry and Muhammad's miracles, such as multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men, suggest the writers aimed to depict Muhammad as a prophet who didn't need to prove his credentials but simply lived his truth. This approach, I argue, diminishes Jesus' life and miracles. Moreover, many stories in the biography seem to aim to provide 'witnesses' or personal conversions to Islam, often based on hearsay. These accounts, with their third-party perspectives, feel less credible and more suspicious to me. Lastly, I find the biography's portrayal of Muhammad as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle man misleading, as historical records show otherwise. I wonder if modern Muslims are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "After Jesus' passing, his teachings and beliefs were quickly overshadowed in the evolution of Christian thought. Over time, Christianity diverged increasingly from its original roots. Present-day society exhibits a heightened awareness and progressive tendencies, though traditionalists may linger and oppose new ideas. Christian historians will likely deepen their understanding of the faith, seeking to distinguish later additions from Jesus' original intentions. Eventually, a strong movement will emerge to strip away these additions, reverting Christianity to its initial form. As this trend spreads in the United States and Europe, masses may return to worshipping as they did during Jesus' time, guided by his ideas alone. Although this could lead to increased uniformity within Christianity, the institutional church will remain strong. Throughout history, we've seen reversals, such as when Christianity went from being persecuted by the Roman Empire to becoming its dominant religion. The impending reversion in Christianity will follow this pattern, simplifying the faith and reducing its diversity. This transformation will be aided by interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically rather than literally. Looking back through history, Judaism was the precursor to Christianity, centered around monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures before the Romans controlled Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. Jews were diverse, categorized into groups like Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, and Zealots, along with a majority of common people.",
            "I contend that \"The Jungle\" by Upton Sinclair illustrates the inherent greed and self-interest of human nature. Individuals prioritize their own well-being and success, disregarding those beneath them. This theme is evident in the factory owners and managers, whose sole aim is to expand their empires, without regard for the harm caused by their actions. Sinclair's description of the factories \"a line of buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky, with great chimneys pouring out rivers of smoke\" underscores the environmental damage they inflict. The owners' apathy towards the suffering of people and animals, whether from pollution or harsh working conditions, is apparent. They prioritize profits over worker safety, as seen in their exploitative labor practices and absence of compensation for layoffs. Laws and regulations during that time offered little protection, allowing managers and owners to exploit their employees in substandard conditions. Workers were essentially trapped in this system, with no recourse or assistance, and were often forced to work to the point of death. Unions, while formed to help, often compounded the workers' misery by enriching themselves. Sinclair's comparison of workers to slaves highlights their desperate plight, unable to escape the brutal system that left them \"hanging always on the verge of starvation, dependent for opportunities of life upon the whim of men as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers\"",
            "Many authors employ various methods to evoke specific emotions or perspectives in their readers. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his novel \"The Great Gatsby,\" employs a number of these techniques with varying degrees of effectiveness. One approach he uses is to pair adjectives and nouns in unusual combinations to create a particular atmosphere. Additionally, he assigns symbolic significance to colors and reuses these symbols to reinforce his narrative. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald attributes specific meanings to colors like white/gray and red/pink, which he then employs to evoke particular sensations around key subjects.\n\nFitzgerald's association of white/gray with uniformity is evident in his use of these colors throughout the novel. White is often associated with higher social status and elegance, while gray signifies age and faded appearances. This is first established at the novel's outset with frequent mentions of white and gray. Characters such as Daisy and Jordan are consistently described as \"in white,\" and even minor characters like Nick, Tom, and Catherine are depicted in white attire. Furthermore, Fitzgerald employs these colors to describe mundane subjects, enhancing their significance. For instance, Nick travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York,\" and the names of partygoers are \"gray names.\" Even simple objects and settings, like apartment houses and cars, are described in terms of white and gray, reinforcing their symbolism.\n\nAfter establishing the meanings of white/gray, Fitzgerald uses them to convey a sense of uniformity or insignificance. This technique begins with Daisy, who is first described as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster.\" This use of white diminishes her character status, making her seem more like a uniform addition, an object of Gatsby's desire. Fitzgerald continues to use this technique with Daisy, such as describing her \"gray haze of fur collar\" and her outfit as \"white\" before her encounter with Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County is exceptionally fertile due to its mild and sunny climate. Common crops include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits such as peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a strong demand for organic community supported agriculture (CSA) in the San Diego region, with many local organizations boasting long waiting lists for their services. Organic eggs and milk are also popular purchases. Many organic farms offer tours of their operations and access to recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching. This setup allows landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitat, promoting recreational use, and creating opportunities for farm tours and educational programs.\n\nOrganic farming typically offers greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemicals. However, it can be more labor-intensive and costly than conventional farming, as it requires intensive management to control pests and weeds and maintain soil fertility without chemicals. Additionally, organic farms may experience higher losses and lack the economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations. Certain practices beneficial to wildlife, like planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, and invasive species removal, also require more labor. Therefore, landowners in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expertise to balance profit and habitat quality.\n\nThe land in question is a 160-acre parcel near Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. This land includes chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, and is part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion in the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan currently recognizes over a hundred species of plants and animals, with many being endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, and others are declining and may soon be listed as endangered, like burrowing owls.\n\nThis land has a rich history of habitation by Native Americans for centuries and was later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. It was part of an original homestead and likely used for grazing and wood production for many years. After researching available government programs, a model organic farm in the same area was identified as a potential example of what could be achieved with this land.",
            "Culture is a crucial factor in any negotiation. It can be understood as much by its absence as by its presence and significance. Culture is not uniform or isolated. Blanket statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are too simplistic. While it's helpful to grasp the general traits of a culture, a skilled negotiator should focus on how the culture's attitudes affect the negotiation process. When encountering a foreign culture, it's natural to relate it to one's own culture, leading to inevitable comparisons. Understanding a foreign culture or mindset may involve delving into its history, understanding its biases, and accepting it for what it is, rather than trying to change it. This is especially important if you're in a weaker bargaining position or in \"away\" territory. Cultural nuances extend beyond national borders, as individual companies often have their own distinct cultures, influencing factors like work hours, communication styles, and hiring practices. Some companies may encourage or restrict employee philanthropy. Even cultures that appear uniform can have deep layers. Understanding a culture's values, which provide its \"why,\" is equally important. For instance, if a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator will refrain from public humiliation. Similarly, a negotiator from a culture that values aggressive bargaining will not relent easily. Before negotiation, it's beneficial to learn about one's opponent's personal background to enhance the process.",
            "The statement \"There is no God\" was supposedly made by a fool, as written in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is the starting point for St. Anselm's argument about God's existence. This belief is shared by another author we'll discuss, Thomas Aquinas. Since both are defending the same idea, and we're to compare their arguments, we'll assume they both believe in the Bible's God for simplicity's sake. Assuming any other god wouldn't allow a fair comparison, as their arguments are specific to this concept. However, both arguments fall short of providing a comprehensive basis for believing in God. To illustrate this, let's first look at St. Anselm's main argument. He proposes that we find truth about God within our own understanding. He argues that because we can't imagine God's non-existence, we can thereby prove his existence. This idea, though complex, suggests that the proof for God lies within our own minds, not requiring external evidence. This is often referred to as faith in Christian texts. In contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas advocates for proving God's existence through reason and empirical evidence alone, without needing faith. His five logical arguments, including change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony, suggest that God's existence can be deduced from logic.",
            "Around the 5th or 6th century BCE, a future Buddha was born. He left the worldly life, achieved enlightenment, and his teachings eventually led to the formation of Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being the most traditional branch. This religion is now about 2500 years old and has evolved significantly since Buddha's time, evident in practices like the annual water-cutting ceremony in Sri Lanka, where monks and laypeople participate despite Buddha not teaching such rituals. These changes span from superficial traditions to the religion's core beliefs. Theravada Buddhism, both from the monastic and lay perspectives, has had to adapt its doctrines over time due to both external and internal influences, both friendly and hostile.\n\nThroughout this discussion, several terms will be used. Internal forces are those originating from within the Buddhist community, while external forces come from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces harm or intend to harm Buddhism, while benign forces do not wish to harm the community but may inadvertently do so. These terms will be frequently used.\n\nFirst, let's explore the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists find refuge in the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma includes the Tripitaka, three collections of texts: the Sutta Pitaka (containing Suttas), the Vinaya Pitaka (disciplinary rules), and the Abhidhamma Pitaka (metaphysical concepts like Anatta, Dukkha, and Anicca). Understanding these concepts helps one break the cycle of Sansara (death and rebirth), along with its components: lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). When one becomes enlightened, these cease. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for laypeople (five precepts) and monks (many more). Fundamental to Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome, and there is a way to achieve this.",
            "America and Mexico once had a long-standing rivalry that lasted from 1836 to 1893, with the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848 serving as the peak of their conflict. Other disputes also occurred between the two nations, with the rivalry subsiding just before World War I. The animosity began due to disagreements over religion, culture, and economic interests, not unlike many border-sharing nations. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that only Mexico and Cuba posed long-term challenges to U.S. diplomacy due to their proximity and rivalry. Religious tensions, rooted in historic distrust between the English and Spanish, were a significant obstacle to friendly relations. Diehl and Goerts (2000) enumerate 17 disputes, mainly involving territorial issues caused by raids and outlaw activities across the border. Schmitt (1974) attributes the easing of the rivalry to Mexico's growing dependence on the U.S. and the shift in American aims from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was unexpectedly struck by a previously unknown illness that left me disabled. At the time, I was a nurse, having chosen this career to ensure safety and security, driven by my childhood experiences and the reassuring mantra that \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" Even though my dream was to become a scientist or journalist, I chose nursing. Yet, here I am, at 46 years old, single, and unable to work. After 15 years on Social Security Disability, I have nothing to call my own, and daily struggles assault my sense of security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, but I know that without the support of my family and some good friends, I wouldn't have lasted this long. When disaster truly strikes, you feel incredibly weak, no matter how strong you are.\n\nMy point is that life throws emergencies at us, big and small, and no matter how well we prepare, some challenges are too great to face alone. While I agree that Americans should not rely solely on big government, I believe we should instead focus on rebuilding trust and mutual support. The Conservatives in the U.S. praise \"rugged individualism\" as the foundation of our country, but our forefathers' resilience came from compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources. Pioneers didn't cross the Rockies alone in wagon trains.\n\nTherefore, while I advocate for preparation, I also urge you to connect with your neighbors and form a support network. I have a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and other essentials. If you have the ability and resources, consider starting a small farm and preserving your own food, or even having a wood stove, but always remember that building a strong community is equally important.",
            "Why do organisms change over time? What factors influence the direction of their evolution? While in 1917 D'Arcy Thompson remarked that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" this sentiment still holds true today. Recently, mathematical modeling has been used to study general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis across both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research aims to explore how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help understand the mechanisms behind the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental changes. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters, which were then used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies with the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). These models, along with experimental and descriptive studies, help us better grasp macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a structure that moves through 360 degrees of space over time. These loops or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis called the columella. The rate at which whorls enlarge can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl, known as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last, called the body whorl. The spire consists of all whorls except the last, with the apex being the tip and the base the opposite end. The aperture is the opening through which the animal extends out of its shell.\n\nShells can be viewed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The \"usual\" orientation is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves first viewing the shell from the apical perspective and determining where the first suture begins. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell into two parts, from which whorls are counted and estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that traverse through time and space as the animal grows its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced using the coordinates of the centers of each whorl's aperture, as well as the horizontal and vertical radii of the aperture. This trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is established, parameters can be varied and modified to alter the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have remained relatively unchanged over the past decade. While the nation is progressing towards several Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, the progress in child and maternal health lags behind what's needed to meet the 2015 goals. This disparity is due to several factors, suggesting that it's crucial to bolster the overall healthcare system rather than focusing solely on specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% now meeting this criterion. However, these skilled workers often include traditional midwives who are unable to handle medical interventions, leading to higher maternal mortality due to complications like hemorrhage. This improvement is somewhat misleading, as there's still significant work to be done. Additionally, the percentage of children under five receiving professional treatment for diarrhea has decreased, and there are concerns about postnatal care, as data is incomplete but shows low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean section rates remain low at 4%, with a notable disparity between urban (7%) and rural (2%) settings. This highlights an issue of healthcare access, with most services concentrated in urban areas. Further, there's a significant gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles (27%), indicating that the poor face greater barriers in accessing healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering strategies to enhance neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is which approach is most effective in addressing the lack of services. Should Indonesia prioritize program-specific interventions or strengthen the overall healthcare system without targeting pre- and postnatal care for mothers and children? While programmatic approaches offer targeted, manageable goals and faster results, they also have drawbacks. Heavy investment in specific areas can lead to funding shortages and human resource imbalances, potentially causing program duplication and increased paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "Victorian novels are distinguished by their meticulous attention to detail and focus on the aristocracy of the era. Two exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, unlike other novels of the time, which enhances the characters' development. These novels often employ dream sequences or dreamlike states to convey mystery, which serves different purposes in each case.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, these dreamlike sequences provide insights into Oliver's inner turmoil, revealing his emotional and psychological state, as well as his awareness of the true nature of events around him. For instance, when he relives the shooting in Chapter 28, it feels like a dream, highlighting Oliver’s lack of control over his fate and the desperate state of his health. The passage emphasizes his inability to regain control of the situation, as he doesn’t notice the unseen force that takes him away, and he experiences constant, fear-driven pain. This event suggests that Oliver has little agency over his life and that his despair is growing, potentially due to the influence of Fagin. It implies that if Oliver had any capacity to react, he would have tried to save himself, but he is overwhelmed and defeated.\n\nThe day passed – the day seemed to pass – and night fell again; night that was long and silent, yet brief, like a fleeting dream.",
            "A few years ago, I worked in an after-school tutoring program for elementary students. While I assisted them in various subjects, my proficiency was greatest in English and reading. A colleague asked me to help a boy named Adrian, who was having significant difficulty with reading. I soon realized that Adrian understood some letters perfectly but struggled with others, which seemed unusual. Adrian was of Latino descent and spoke fluent English, which made his situation puzzling. We faced challenges until I met Adrian's mother. During a field trip, she arrived to pick him up, and I realized she spoke only Spanish. With my limited Spanish, we managed to communicate, and I discovered that Adrian could read but was unfamiliar with the English alphabet. I don't know if this insight helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nThis story highlights the complex issue of language barriers in schools, particularly in California. Even a child who speaks perfect English might struggle with reading due to unfamiliarity with the English alphabet. This problem is evident, and while solutions exist, they are not straightforward. For children like Adrian, who spoke fluent English but needed help with the alphabet, tutoring was effective. For those who speak little to no English, the challenge is more complex.\n\nThe dual language system could be beneficial. While it's often feared to be resource-intensive and ineffective for most students, research shows that children in these programs outperform their peers. However, implementing it as a standard practice rather than an exception would benefit all students. Special bilingual aides or tutors can help, but requiring all teachers to be bilingual isn't practical. Combining different approaches, such as dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes, is key to addressing this issue.",
            "From a young age, many of us are taught about something beyond our comprehension, often through religious instruction or personal introspection. While some embrace the faith of their parents, others reject it, preferring their own perspective. Regardless of our chosen path, we strive to define our spirituality through our unique views. We seek guidance in the darkness to lead us into the light.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father replied when I asked about his favorite type of bird. We sat on our porch, listening to the rain as we shared cigarettes. The gutters overflowed, drenching the plants along the edge. He gazed into the rain, his eyes reflecting a mix of searching and reminiscing. He appeared thinner, his hair less dense than before. I was overwhelmed by his condition and struggled to discuss how much I'd miss him. Instead, I hugged him and sat closer, joining him in watching the rain.\n\nMy father passed away in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The treatments prolonged his suffering, but I couldn't watch him die. I chose to remember him by his life, not his death. I stayed in bed for three days, waiting for news. No one contacted me.",
            "The \"Gothic Novel\" is, in essence and name, an \"old-new\" oxymoron, as Ian Watt describes in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been both criticized and praised, accused of lacking depth and celebrated for its 'terrible sublime' quality (Burke). The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, combined the ideas of ancient and modern romances to create the proto-Gothic genre and a new mode of literary expression. Walpole employed old theatrical elements and modern mimicking of nature in contemporary novels to present what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre continues to draw upon medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, despite the term \"gothic\" originally being used to describe various peoples, styles, and time periods. Initially seen as archaic or unsophisticated against \"modern\" societal and literary advancements, the blend of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the novel format that allowed readers a deeper look into characters' psychology has enabled Gothic literature to endure and remain both obsolete and fresh to readers from different time periods.\n\nOne key idea present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, training a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is significant to Gothic writers because it embodies the ideal of a brave, honorable, and competent knight, and the perceived or supposed lack of such qualities in contemporary society. By employing chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, hinting at Gothic's evolution towards Romanticism, and used to strive for improvement in the present. Writing during a politically turbulent time and possibly despondent over the future, Walpole may have felt that the morality and inherent goodness present in the gothic era had been lost in contemporary society. This perspective is evident in several characters, such as Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits. Before meeting Frederic, he is described as a:\n\nThe description of him includes traditional chivalric elements: Frederic is a prince, has suffered tragedies, and is presumed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, introducing the soon-to-be typical Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves the series of steps that take an order from a customer back through the stages of raw materials, production, and distribution, delivering the product to the customer. The term was coined by Keith Oliver in 1982 as a way to describe the planning, execution, and control of the supply chain to meet customer needs efficiently. Six key components make up a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these components to enhance customer service. Production, the first step, forms the basis for the entire supply chain. It involves deciding what, when, where, and how to produce goods based on customer demand, which is typically determined by market analysis. Managers must consider market conditions and customer preferences to decide on the products to produce and their quantities. They also need to choose the optimal location for production, balancing volume, quality, and cost. After setting the production location, managers focus on scheduling and equipment maintenance. This step is crucial as every detail impacts the overall process. For instance, retail giants like Wal-Mart and Target have detailed processes and procedures for every aspect of their operations, reducing confusion and ensuring smooth workflow. Supply, the second key element, involves making strategic decisions about facility capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Companies may have multiple divisions for a single product, each with unique equipment, workers, and expertise. Managers must select the best division for each product process. Outsourcing can help achieve velocity, the ability to provide quality and flexibility while controlling costs.",
            "Hitler exists in Burma, according to the sign.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone at a street corner with a cardboard sign above her head, bearing a disturbing message written in Sharpie. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation controlled by an oppressive military regime that took power through a coup d'état in 1962. In 2007, public protests led by Buddhist monks, dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution,\" occurred following a decade of silence. Initially, the Burmese government tolerated the monks' peaceful demonstrations, but it soon escalated into a violent conflict with the military. Foreign journalists were detained and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed on September 27th, 2007, for covering the protests. The official death toll stands at 13, but Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army, claimed thousands had been killed.\n\nThis is not a new phenomenon. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over their citizens. Early Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, Japanese emperors were believed to be gods, and U.S. President George W. Bush supposedly had weekly meetings with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a Conservative Party affiliate.\n\nFamous examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students protested the government's authoritarian rule, with official reports ranging from 200-3,000 dead. The Rwandan genocide in the 1990s saw Hutu militia groups, backed by the Rwandan government, systematically kill Tutsis and political moderates. Hitler's Third Reich, a period spanning several years and countries, resulted in widespread persecution and murder of Jews.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence in jazz is largely due to his longevity and his ability to guide his orchestra. Although his piano playing is often subtle, Ellington excelled as a composer, crafting intricate pieces that highlighted the unique talents of his band members. He created a framework that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also writing pieces that showcased the specific styles of his players. This approach not only emphasized the tone of the orchestra as a whole but also resulted in some of the most innovative and brilliant jazz compositions of all time.\n\nThe Grove Music Dictionary highlights Ellington's sound and innovation by referencing \"Creole Love Call.\" This piece, which uses the voice as a jazz instrument, demonstrates Ellington’s early use of vocal texture and color without lyrics. The piece, a slow twelve-bar blues with six choruses, showcases several soloists, including a muted trumpet, clarinet, and his voice itself. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded the following year, Ellington's orchestration and ear for tone color are evident in a call and response between a muted trumpet and scat singing. The song \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further exemplifies this, with Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton using his muted trombone to introduce the melody.",
            "She had always felt a void, a longing that remained unfulfilled. This feeling began when she was 14, entering her teenage years, and persisted at 17, even though she had decided she wanted someone rather than an object. Despite boys being drawn to her, none sparkled her interest. She often wondered why this was, but her thoughts didn't yield satisfying theories. So, she lived her life, always curious about her desires.\n\nAt home, life was usually serene. Her parents were peaceful and harmonious, rarely arguing even with their daughter, except when she asserted her independence. She was their lively, lovable daughter, a stark contrast to their calm nature.\n\nToday, however, was far from serene. As she moved from room to room in search of inspiration, she heard her mother's scream from the kitchen. Running in, she found her mother on the floor, in pain. Quickly, she asked for assistance and rushed her mother to the car. The hospital's antiseptic scent filled the air, but her mind was focused solely on helping her mother.\n\nHer mother had lost her balance while climbing a step stool to reach a high cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that sticking closely to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), measured by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", correlates with a reduced likelihood of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related deaths. The aMed diet is a variant of the Med diet that emphasizes higher consumption of plant-based foods (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (over saturated fats), and fish, while limiting intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious observational studies have shown an inverse relationship between adherence to the Med diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial also found that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in overweight individuals. Prior studies did not specifically focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 years, who were part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. Over six periods from 1984 to 2004, researchers calculated an aMed diet score using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) to assess nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of nurses maintained their involvement throughout the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. Where documentation was unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better capture long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (by averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for potential confounding factors (variables that could skew results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a severe financial crisis, characterized by rising unemployment, a collapsed housing market, and the demise of many prominent financial institutions. This economic downturn continues today, prompting the question: what caused this crisis, and how can we prevent future occurrences? The crisis was largely a result of shortsighted and self-interested political decisions that compelled banks and corporations to issue sub-prime loans within an inadequately developed financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to back and repack these mortgages into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and credit default swaps (CDS). When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves, which led them to transfer the resulting turmoil onto the repackaged mortgages and into the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of the financial crisis were planted during the Clinton administration in 1999, as the president sought a second term. To boost his popularity, he loosened lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime mortgage crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times warned at the time, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's leading home mortgage underwriter, faced pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage lending to low and moderate-income individuals, and faced pressure from shareholders to maintain its remarkable profit growth.\" Holmes accurately predicted the consequences, stating, \"The government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, requiring a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As the introduction mentions, and Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending led to the economic collapse.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the complex structures of mortgages. The widespread use of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) in the years leading up to the crisis further interwove different sectors of the economy with the housing market. This increased leverage made U.S. households and financial markets highly sensitive to even minor price fluctuations. When the housing bubble burst, financial institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities suffered significant losses. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for around 30% of the USA’s GDP. Ultimately, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dissolved, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become heavily regulated commercial banks. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Exposition: The section of your narrative where you spread your wings and captivate your audience with your enthralling prose, or where you risk losing your readers' attention. Dr. Merlin has had her share of frustration while dealing with this part, often finding herself amidst a flurry of unnecessary details. Despite the well-known advice to \"show, not tell,\" many writers, including Dr. Merlin, still struggle with exposition, often giving too much background information too quickly.\n\nExposition is the part where you simply inform the audience about past events, often in straightforward language. In movies, it's when one character shares a long monologue of information, like \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, this is done by the author.\n\nConsider this example: While reading a story, you're told that the main character met her love, got married, and then lost him. You wouldn't expect this entire backstory to take up two pages with limited dialogue. Instead, you'd expect the author to flesh out the husband's character, showing his love for his wife through his words and actions. The same goes for the heroine, where her character should be evident through her interactions with him. This way, you'd feel the emotional impact of his death and connect with the heroine's experience more deeply.\n\nIn essence, you need to add substance to the bare facts of the story. Sometimes, the urge to rush through certain details is strong. Perhaps you're introducing a new character who was once in the Air Force, now runs a gas station, has been married twice, likes fishing, dreams of owning the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast. Instead of just stating these facts, incorporate them into the character's actions and dialogue.",
            "I tuned in to two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first live broadcast was from NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story reported a man named Shad Hostettler who stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. They aired his mug shot, and he appeared to have a menacing appearance. The story was given minimal coverage, dedicating only about two minutes to it. The details were scant, mentioning only that he had stabbed her multiple times and was arrested. I think the time spent was appropriate.\n\nThe second story was about a young man named Travis Buyers, 18, who had been critically injured in a shooting in the Sharon Woods area. There were no arrests or suspects at the time, and the SWAT team was investigating. This story seemed rushed, and I believe this could be due to it involving a minority individual. I've often noticed that crimes against minorities are less frequently reported or receive less attention. On the other hand, crimes against whites, especially children, are often heavily covered by the media.\n\nThe next story discussed a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given on the incident's location, and it was determined to be a .22 caliber rifle bullet. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThe following story warned about rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They mentioned temperatures would be in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The report was brief but served as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nAnother story covered a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man, about six feet tall and weighing 150 pounds, dressed in a hoodie sweatshirt. The story seemed to emphasize his race and skin color more than necessary.\n\nThe final story discussed Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin sentenced for distributing marijuana in large quantities from Texas to Ohio. Instead of saying 25 years, they mentioned 300 months. It's unclear why they used this phrasing, possibly to make it sound more severe. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, which seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "The bond between brothers is profound and unshakable, encompassing a range of emotions such as love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers possess a deep understanding of each other, often seeing themselves reflected in their siblings. This intimate bond is most evident in dire situations, where both positive and negative emotions can be exposed. Understanding the complexities of this fraternal bond involves acknowledging the consequences that come with it. By looking into a brother's eyes, one sees not how they are perceived by others, but their true self. Their character is revealed through their actions and the consequences of those actions. In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers delve into this theme, facing the turmoil of their emotions in a vividly described landscape. A climax of bitterness and intense pride leads to one brother's demise. The story explores this theme through the protagonist's, Doodle's, direct characterization and their interactions, as well as the narrator's perspective, which conveys the protagonist's feelings and his worldview, significantly influencing his actions. The protagonist's motivations can be distilled to a single emotion: pride. Starting from their first outing together to their final, fateful trip, he harbors resentment towards Doodle. He longed for a brother who could learn and participate in various activities like holding his breath, running, or climbing trees, but Doodle's heart condition made this impossible. The protagonist initially feels anger towards Doodle, even considering harming him at one point, yet a simple smile from Doodle melts his heart, revealing his underlying love and weaker resolve.",
            "The human brain is an intricate, innovative information-processing system. As technology evolved from primitive to advanced, so did the metaphors used to represent the brain. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, followed by a book, and most recently, a computer. As you delve into understanding the brain, keep in mind the limited usefulness of these metaphors and their potential to lead to incorrect conclusions.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory organs converting physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or light into electrochemical signals. This sensory information is repeatedly transformed through the brain's algorithms in both bottom-up and top-down processes. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing compiles simple data like color, orientation, and border changes to identify the box. Top-down processing utilizes decisions from these bottom-up processes to accelerate recognition of the box. In this example, top-down processing might help you classify the object as a black box rather than a hole.\n\nOnce information is processed, an attention filter determines its importance and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. Conversely, you might pick out your name even in a noisy room. The processing of information involves multiple stages, with results repeatedly modulated by attention.\n\nTo process information, the brain must first store it. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Information is initially encoded based on its type of sensory input. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally (how the word looks), phonemically (how it sounds), or semantically (what it means). Once stored, information must be maintained. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which holds information for about 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons for a short duration. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are numerous theories on how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on human memory retrieval, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that knowledge is organized into nodes representing concepts, with nodes linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the impending threat of technology and capitalism through his dystopian novel, Brave New World. The societal structure prioritizes community over individuality and promotes immediate happiness, conditioning citizens from birth. People are pawns in a larger system dictated by the World Controller. Examining the novel through Marxist lenses reveals Huxley's concerns about these developments. The novel employs Marxist terms like homogenization and reification to highlight issues with the emerging capitalistic economy. Capitalism is satirized through the concept of false consciousness, where the common people are kept unaware of their true economic relations and focused solely on personal gain. This is achieved through ideological control, evident in the conditioning of people in Brave New World. Lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, have no autonomy, with hypnopædia reinforcing their desires to consume. Hegemony, where a group dominates another, is also present in the World State. The lower classes are unaware of this manipulation, 'buying into' the ideology that supports capitalism. Upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, are aware but accept their position. The novel's lack of meaningful relationships between characters and the superficiality of interactions reflect the loss of free will and expression. Love and strong emotions are absent, as are meaningful interactions; men discuss women's physical appearance, and women discuss their encounters. Each class's acceptance of their status in the hierarchy illustrates the socioeconomic impact of capitalism, with people believing they are superior due to their consumption and obedience.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for roughly 2.5 years, which equates to about 4.5 semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many students, including myself. During my freshman year, I was assigned a dorm room in East Halls, the farthest eastward point on campus (excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center). Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in locations like the Willard building, situated near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes, especially in bad weather, which is common in State College. An alumnus, not much older than me, shared that in the past, the East Halls dorms were secluded by large tracts of empty land. Today, that space is occupied by sports fields, new buildings such as the new Creamery and health services building, and apartments, as the campus continues to expand, making it increasingly difficult to move from one place to another. The most effective solution for this mobility issue is cycling, but simply having bikes isn't enough. Students need to use them, and the campus must be designed to accommodate cyclists. My friend who recently resumed cycling after a few years mentioned that he couldn't understand why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “they’re the only viable way to get around.” Cycling is not only efficient but also beneficial for one's health. A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of physical exertion can cover 30 miles or more. Like many students, I now reside off campus, just as far from the center as some dorms. The best decision I made this year was to buy a bike. My daily class in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my home, can be reduced to 5 minutes by cycling. The main problem is that Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, isn't always easy to navigate on a bike. Although walking also has its merits, I don't have the time. Without a bike, walking would be my only dependable option for getting to class. Daily walks to Thomas would consume an extra 30-40 minutes, totaling around 2.5 hours a week. Adding the time spent walking to and from other classes, appointments, and so forth, that's more time than I can afford to spare."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",

Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In my pursuit of a degree in social work, I aim to work with the Division of Family and Children Services to support children who have faced abuse or neglect, and to assist troubled families. I can contribute the following values to the field: dedication to service, respect for others, integrity, a commitment to fostering healthier relationships, and a drive to continually improve my professional skills. These values are not only essential for social workers but are also deeply personal to me.\n\nGrowing up, I have always desired to help others, although I was unsure of the specific career path. Throughout high school and college, I witnessed many people avoid confronting their problems through denial or unhealthy coping mechanisms. These experiences led me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a year off to consider my career path. One summer, a friend introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was escaping from his abusive parents. He had called the police to his home. I offered to help and visited the parents, discussing my concerns with them. The parents appeared nervous and blamed their son for involving outsiders in trivial disputes. This experience sparked my interest in social work to help resolve family conflicts.\n\nMoreover, social justice is another crucial value in social work. Society claims to value individuality but often promotes conformity. I believe in the uniqueness of each person and advocate for social justice by protesting against injustices, such as wearing unconventional clothing, supporting LGBTQ+ rights, and standing against racism and discrimination. I will continue to champion social justice throughout my life.",
            "This document examines the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to insomnia. The Biological model centers on inherited genetic factors and medical aspects of health. Sociocultural models, on the other hand, explore environmental influences related to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The ensuing review evaluates insomnia and other primary sleep disorders through these models, explaining each selected study and critiquing its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified as primary, secondary to another mental disorder, or resulting from other health issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while those linked to mental disorders are associated with Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorders may be due to medical complications or substance use. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and unspecified Dyssomnias. Primary Insomnia is characterized by difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia involves challenges in staying awake. Narcolepsy involves symptoms like cataplexy or automatic REM sleep. Parasomnias are characterized by behavioral abnormalities or physiological events during sleep, including Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and unspecified Parasomnias. Sleep disorders related to mental disorders involve sleep difficulties associated with clinical (Axis I) or personality (Axis II) disorders.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genes, inherited traits, and physiological aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study using mice discovered that GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are responsible for sleep-wake states. Activation of GABAA receptors promotes sleep, while inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. Baclofen, a GABAB agonist, increased sleep duration in the study. This suggests that findings from animal models can be generalized to humans, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for GABAB receptors. Impairments in these receptors could hinder adequate sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if the genetic trait is inherited, it could influence sleep, and alterations in the receptor could disrupt sleep, negatively impacting daily life activities.",
            "This paper examines three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD). Firstly, it provides a concise definition of the disorder. Secondly, it outlines the diagnostic process, including common signs, or \"red flags\". Finally, it offers suggestions for how teachers in inclusive classrooms can support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) refers to the efficiency and effectiveness of the central nervous system (CNS) in utilizing auditory information. Specifically, (C)AP involves the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the underlying neurobiological activity that generates electrophysiological auditory potentials. In essence, it is a condition where the brain cannot properly process what is heard. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally but struggle with separating words or distinguishing conversations from background noise.\n\nThe earliest reference to the condition, initially called \"auditory imperception,\" dates back to the mid-1950s when researchers were studying children with communication disorders. The Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing diagnostic tests in 1954, while Kimura introduced dichotic testing in 1961 to explain the physiological basis of dichotic perception. A national conference in 1977 further stimulated research on CAPD.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways: individuals may have difficulty localizing or hearing sounds in space, discriminating between multiple sounds, recognizing sound patterns, differentiating changes in speech (such as detecting sarcasm from tone changes), having sounds blocked by subsequent sounds, synthesizing sound clues meaningfully, or determining the sequence of auditory information. Diagnosis of CAPD involves systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function, which can be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others. There is no single test or tool that consistently identifies CAPD, and its cause is unknown. Many diagnostic tests present patients with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and ask them to differentiate specific items, such as words or numbers. Advanced tests record acoustic signals within the ear and measure responses.",
            "In \"Twelfth Night,\" it appears that while disguise can aid in maintaining prolonged deception, ultimately, one must discard this new persona or risk losing their true identity. Disclosing a lie can also lead to estrangement. Therefore, individuals must choose between self-preservation or maintaining relationships with others. While some may respond calmly to being deceived, others may be offended. The topic of gender role reversal in deception raises complex issues, particularly the question of why one might feel compelled to adopt the other gender's appearance. In Viola's case, it serves as a means of self-defense in a foreign land: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249) Her plan succeeds, but she becomes isolated from women, cutting off an important support system. Furthermore, she inadvertently attracts romantic feelings from Olivia, who mistakes her for Sebastian. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) Viola also grapples with suppressed romantic feelings towards Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261) While this can be seen as progressive, modern readers might interpret Twelfth Night as a depiction of how deception can reveal hidden emotions, especially in Olivia and Orsino. Passages suggest that these characters may harbor unexpressed subconscious desires forced to the surface by Viola/Cesario's presence. For example, Olivia's love for Cesario could be due to his male appearance, or it might reveal deeper feelings towards women. However, it's likely that Olivia's attraction to Cesario is more about appearances, as Shakespeare's characters often judge based on looks. This is evident in Olivia's swift shift from loving Cesario to regarding Cesario/Viola as family rather than a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "German colonial rule has been widely recognized for its harshness, particularly in regard to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. While it's impossible to summarize an entire colonial empire so simplistically, the German colonial empire exhibited a remarkable diversity in its policies and administration, as well as in its educational approaches. Educational systems varied greatly across colonies. When the British took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a considerable number of educated and literate Africans. German educational initiatives in Cameroon and other colonies were also commended by contemporary authors. The contrast in South West Africa (now Namibia) was stark. Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a key role in the education of natives, in South West Africa, the task of educating natives was largely left to missionary societies that received minimal government support. The government did invest heavily in the education of Europeans, setting up a system of state schools and providing more support and regulation for missionary schools. These policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies had significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Numerous social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience in South West Africa. This paper aims to broaden the discussion by identifying these factors and focusing on new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities toward native Africans.\n\nThere is a substantial body of literature about education in the German colonial empire, much of it in German and written either during or shortly after the colonial era. Earlier works mainly aimed to describe the educational systems in these colonies, while later works, often in English, expanded the discourse through comparative studies and in-depth analyses. These studies highlighted the differences in educational systems across colonies. The most notable work addressing this topic is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors accounting for their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa explains many of the unique aspects of its educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial territories, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of it is covered by arid desert. This climate was reflected in a European population that was relatively hospitable, with nearly 15,000 whites in South West Africa by 1913, compared to around 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has expanded significantly over the past century, encompassing numerous genres that are hard to enumerate exhaustively. This complexity is further compounded by the fact that many of these genres, such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have spawned numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. In particular, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has emerged as one of the most diverse and expressive genres in Popular Music over the last 40 years. Its expressiveness stems from its broad emotional range, which often leans towards darker hues. Additionally, the genre's flexibility has led to the creation of numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, creating a continuous chain of evolution. Today, the heavy metal scene is so fragmented that it's challenging to define what constitutes heavy metal, as it has absorbed themes from various other genres. To grasp the contemporary metal music scene, one must first understand the metal movement's origins and its nature as a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nHeavy metal, in many respects, is defined by its darkness. It can be seen as \"music with more\" — more bass, more volume, more aggression, and more theatricality. It emphasizes instrumental prowess, with musicians demonstrating their proficiency. Moreover, metal has a strong association with drug use, particularly psychedelic drugs in the 1970s, which allowed musicians to explore more extreme, otherworldly sounds. This genre possesses dark, visceral qualities, which was unusual for popular music at the time, as it strayed from more upbeat themes. Later generations of metal musicians have drawn inspiration from these dark, visceral qualities, which are reminiscent of the Romantic Era. Lyrics like those from \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles exemplify this darkness and are considered one of the early Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song and marked The Beatles' attempt to match the Stones' heavier, darker sound on their album \"The White Album\".",
            "Several years before Surrealist artists began creating their dream-like works, Henri Rousseau was already crafting his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. \"The Dream,\" a 1910 painting by the renowned Post-Impressionist artist, showcases not only a woman enchanted by the wonders of a dream landscape but also Rousseau's personal dreams and ambitions as an artist. Throughout his career, Rousseau yearned for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet he faced a challenging internal conflict: to conform to or imitate established painting styles to gain acceptance in the critical art world or to retain his creative independence and uniqueness. \"The Dream\" embodies Rousseau's lifelong internal struggle. Prior to examining \"The Dream\" through this lens, one should be familiar with Rousseau's biography. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Rousseau's father ran a successful tinsmith and hardware business. He lacked formal art training but worked as a gabelou (employee of the municipal toll service) until age forty, earning the nickname douanier (customs inspector). After the deaths of his wife and infant children, Rousseau turned to painting for solace and new beginnings. Unlike his contemporaries, Rousseau was a folk painter, echoing the hopes and dreams of the common people. Understanding Rousseau's desire for artistic acceptance is not surprising given his lack of formal training, late start, and the presence of many esteemed artists working concurrently. While he and Matisse were rivals in the art world, they differed in painting styles, subjects, and motivations. According to Jan Gordon in \"Modern French Painters,\" Matisse feared painting tritely, whereas Rousseau aimed to create something conventional enough to gain admission into the Artiste Français.",
            "Many prominent thinkers have proposed a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, and truth and beauty. I contend that this connection has a fundamental reason. John Keats, in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" asserts that \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of our knowledge comes from education or experience, we intuitively appreciate ethics and aesthetics without formal teaching. Both ethics and aesthetics seek to describe rather than prescribe. Our analyses of morality and beauty are primarily attempts to explain the reasons behind something's beauty or morality, not to dictate rules for creating good art or moral behavior. Critiquing art or morals can't fully capture their essence. For instance, discussing the worth of Da Vinci's Mona Lisa may involve aspects like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't explain why it's good art. Often, when discussing a favorite piece of art or literature, we hear phrases like, \"There's just something about it\" before delving into more complex explanations. Both art and morality cannot be fully reduced to descriptions of their qualities, as there's always a transcendent element, as Flannery O'Connor and Wittgenstein suggest. I believe this shared transcendent nature binds ethics and aesthetics together. I posit that we experience both morality and art most potently in a way that's ineffable, or beyond explanation, at a noumenal level. This is especially true for literature, which uniquely combines moral quality with its aesthetic appeal, as McKean observes.",
            "Germany today is recognized as a powerful and unified nation, with a distinctive culture that varies from the alpine region of Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel, and from Cologne along the Rhine River to the central region and the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. This cultural diversity is not surprising given that Germany has evolved from a mix of different tribes and sources. The land of Germania, the ancestral home of the Germans, has an uncertain origin. Some scholars suggest it comes from the Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before crossing the Rhine and fighting against Gallic forces, as noted by Tacitus in AD 98. Others propose that the name derives from the German weapon, the ger, or from the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans' loud nature. The early Roman historian Tacitus, in his writings, argued that the Germans were indigenous and had not mixed with other races through immigration or contact. He described Germany as a place with harsh conditions, which might not attract immigrants from more hospitable climates like Asia, Africa, or Italy. The Romans primarily traded with the Germanic tribes, with occasional military campaigns, but mostly returned home to their empire. As Germanic tribes began appearing in the first century, they lived on the Roman Empire's borders, trading their goods and skills within the Roman army.",
            "I gazed down, my mind empty, observing the scene before me. Impassively, silently, with a practiced detachment that analyzed the picture without connecting to any abstract understanding, my mind processed the image. Thoughts flickered through my mind, but they were ephemeral and fleeting, like a quick and smooth flow of consciousness. I couldn't relate to the picture as an artist would, but rather experienced it as a passive observer. I had always wanted to draw, and I had once bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" which taught everything from understanding a pencil to how the brain interprets lines. One technique it taught was to frame a square around a picture to simplify it, turning a complex scene into a manageable one. Looking at the bowl of fruit in front of me, I couldn't mentally frame the picture. I was too overwhelmed, too awestruck to process it. I was standing at the beginning of what could be my artistic journey, my \"Work in Brown.\" My hand touched the brush, muscles tensed and relaxed as I moved it through space, giving form to my thoughts. Water swirled smoothly, clear and clean. Small bits of matter broke away, floating away. Flush after flush, I struggled to dislodge the stubborn brown package. Frustrated, I gripped the mop and began to wrap it around my hand like a glove. Standing tall, I slowly dipped my hand into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Teenagers are dying in car accidents at an alarming rate due to a combination of factors. The National Institutes of Health point out that a key issue is the immaturity of the teenage brain, which is not yet fully capable of handling the hazards of driving. Lack of experience also plays a significant role, leading to more crashes, rollovers, speeding incidents, and off-road accidents. Teenagers are particularly at risk when they drive with peers, as studies have shown a correlation between the number of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents.\n\nSeveral states have tried to enhance teen driver safety by implementing provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and forbid minors as passengers. However, these measures are considered temporary solutions. The underlying problem is that, statistically, young drivers are not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities that come with driving. Psychology research suggests that even at 18, teens might not be mature enough to drive safely. The risk-taking tendency among teens under 19-20 years old is another concern. By 2010, the Baby Boomer generation's children will be old enough to drive, adding millions of new teen drivers to the roads.\n\nA reasonable solution would involve schools continuing to offer driver's education classes but prohibiting anyone under 18 from driving a vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued before granting a full driver's license, along with a certain number of required driving practice hours. These hours could be based on current state requirements, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Nationwide legislation would be a practical and effective way to protect teen drivers across the country, as the problem affects all states.",
            "Upon perusing the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all the trick films, numbering fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films employ creative editing to create illusions. My analysis primarily focused on detailing the poetics of most trick films and identifying unique characteristics in a few of the later ones. Generally, these films are confined to a set, staged within a frontal proscenium, with no camera movement, using long and medium shots, and adhering to the one-shot-per-film rule. However, a few films from the early 20th century challenge these norms by incorporating elements like multiple shots.\n\nOne common feature among trick films is their indoor setting, framed within a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, not moving to track figures or objects. This style was prevalent in early films and drew inspiration from theatre and vaudeville. One limitation is that figures in trick films usually move side-to-side, without moving towards or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move back and forth horizontally, without the camera following them out of frame.\n\nThis frontal proscenium setup leads to long and, less frequently, medium shots, with close-ups never occurring in any Edison trick film. This technique, like the theatre and vaudeville tradition, allows the audience to see the entire performance at once, framed by the stage borders. Actors do not move towards the camera, so close-ups are absent.\n\nMost early trick films follow the rule that one conceptual shot equates to one film, restricting their length to about a minute or less. This also limits their dramatic or narrative potential, with most focusing on simple vaudeville-style tricks like magic and disappearing acts. However, a single conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes may not correspond to a single physical shot. For instance, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a closer look reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" starts, despite the film being conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor from Caroline was an early and passionate advocate for the Republican cause. Primarily an agriculturalist, his background and brief political career shaped him into a staunch defender of personal liberties and government oversight. His commitment to agrarianism informed his views on governance, including issues of sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judiciary. Taylor believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to establish a perfect system due to the lack of traditional barriers, allowing for self-government. He held that natural rights are interconnected and should be beyond government control to maintain their full value. He contended that in a civilized society, power should not rest with the strongest or most cunning. Taylor advocated for a government that accounts for the inherent goodness and evil in humans, adhering to a dualistic morality. He viewed good principles as those that safeguard property, enhance agriculture, and curb capitalism. He believed that self-interest, while natural in humans, becomes harmful when it leads to societal exploitation. He argued for a limited federal government, with no powers beyond those explicitly stated in the Constitution, to avoid despotism and corruption. He also considered the Declaration of Independence the true foundation of the United States, as it more clearly defines the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "In Figure 17, we noticed a sharp decrease in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. The reason behind this drop is unclear, but it could be attributed to the start of winter in New England, which often leads to fewer people commuting by bicycle or on foot. Additionally, December is typically a busy time for students and faculty, as it marks the end of the fall semester and the holiday season. This could have caused the commuter log to be overlooked. Furthermore, the month-long break for students and faculty due to the holiday season and the resumption of classes in late January might also explain the low number of submissions. It's possible that the project experienced an initial surge in enthusiasm that naturally declined. To counteract this trend, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which led to an increase in log submissions. However, maintaining project momentum was challenging due to both natural decreases in engagement and the impact of holiday and semester breaks. Another obstacle was the cultural preference for driving cars, so offering incentives for alternative commuting modes was crucial. We provided various prizes, such as gift certificates to local businesses and even larger prizes like bicycles or hybrid/electric cars. The value of the prizes could have been increased over time to potentially boost participation even more.",
            "An ETF (exchange-traded fund) is a type of security that was developed to mirror an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund, but it trades more flexibly like a stock on an exchange. ETFs offer the diversification of index funds and the perks of individual stock ownership, such as the ability to short sell, use margin, and buy as few as one share per trade. Despite these advantages, ETFs typically have lower expense ratios than mutual funds. However, they do come with a trade-off: you have to pay a commission for each ETF trade, just like you would for a stock. Additionally, ETFs are known for their wide range of available funds. It's beneficial for investors to assess whether the claimed benefits, such as diversification, actually exist and to what degree. For this analysis, we will examine the IHF ETF and its top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the total assets, to evaluate if owning a single ETF could provide benefits similar to owning a diversified portfolio of the top 10 stocks, and if there are configurations that offer better risk-return ratios. To streamline our analysis, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings. The table below lists these holdings and their respective percentages of total assets.\n\nTo gauge how well these top 10 stocks represent the IHF ETF, we will calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consists of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF's holdings. The calculations for Beta and return are shown in the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, it's clear that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, an increase of 16%. Additionally, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is lower by 0.12 than that of the entire ETF. Based on these results, a portfolio of the top 10 holdings could potentially offer a higher return with a lower risk (Beta). However, statistical differences between the two portfolios remain uncertain.\n\nTo further evaluate the statistical differences between the two portfolios, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation against that of the IHF ETF.",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is one of Edgar Allan Poe's self-proclaimed best poems. In this work, Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott links to Virgil. Virgil used the term to refer to an island north of Britain, seen by the Greeks as the farthest known world. While Virgil indeed used the term, another more recent source may have influenced Poe. Poe was particularly interested in German authors.\n\nThe quote is notable for demonstrating Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writing. Karl J. Arndt, in \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" points out the similarities between Poe's and Goethe's poems, concluding that Poe was likely imitating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned writer of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. In the second part of Faust, there's a short poem called \"The King of Thulé,\" about a king who loses his wife after receiving a goblet from her. Driven by grief to drink, he eventually decides to end his life and throw the goblet into the sea. The king's fate echoes the desolation and grief found in \"Dream-Land.\"\n\nPoe mentions Thule twice in his works, including \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" In \"Dream-Land,\" he uses the term twice as bookends for the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thulé as dark and lonely, haunted by dead friends, and devoid of color—a representation of Poe's own feelings of loss and despair over drinking. The poem reads as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe's world.\n\nGoethe was a significant author whose works Poe would have known, possibly due to his admiration for Tennyson. When asked about Tennyson, Poe expressed his admiration. Additionally, Poe would have been exposed to Goethe's work through various reproductions following the original publications.",
            "According to California law, could a customer injured by falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store win punitive damages by proving the store manager acted maliciously, knowing the spill was dangerous but not addressing it for half an hour to finish his dinner?\n\nA judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages outright. To win such damages, she must show the store manager's actions were deliberate and showed a disregard for the risk of harm, as well as that the actions were particularly egregious. Palmer can argue that the manager should have cleaned the spill promptly to prevent further injuries, given that multiple customers had previously slipped and fallen due to spills. While her argument that the manager's inaction was despicable may not be overwhelmingly convincing, it is still reasonable given that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in the store in 2009, and the manager did not take sufficient action to ensure customer safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee named Rich Wayne informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin responded that he was on his dinner break and couldn't deal with the issue. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also reported the spill to Martin, who responded similarly. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Before Palmer's accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for both compensatory and punitive damages, and we are considering whether to file a summary judgment motion against the punitive damages claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can obtain punitive damages for a non-contractual breach if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that either intended to cause harm or, if there was no such intent, was \"despicable\" and was done with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Id. at § (c)(1). Courts have deemed conduct malicious when the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of their actions and willfully failed to avoid them. Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "Around four years ago, I took an Islam class at CBC. Our class frequently debated whether Islam is a hostile religion, and that question seems more pertinent now than ever. Reflecting on events since 9/11, I've noticed a shift in the U.S. media's portrayal of Islam and extremists, from hostility to extreme tolerance. In 2001, it's unlikely we would have seen a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with an evident Muslim background in his family. The Prophet Muhammad's biography intrigues me because it seems to conflict with the historical accounts of his personality. Traditionally, I believed Muhammad forced converts to Islam through conquest, but the biography portrays him as a humble prophet misunderstood by others, who one by one came to acknowledge his teachings. The similarities between Jesus' ministry and Muhammad's miracles, such as multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men, suggest the writers aimed to depict Muhammad as a prophet who didn't need to prove his credentials but simply lived his truth. This approach, I argue, diminishes Jesus' life and miracles. Moreover, many stories in the biography seem to aim to provide 'witnesses' or personal conversions to Islam, often based on hearsay. These accounts, with their third-party perspectives, feel less credible and more suspicious to me. Lastly, I find the biography's portrayal of Muhammad as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle man misleading, as historical records show otherwise. I wonder if modern Muslims are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "After Jesus' passing, his teachings and beliefs were quickly overshadowed in the evolution of Christian thought. Over time, Christianity diverged increasingly from its original roots. Present-day society exhibits a heightened awareness and progressive tendencies, though traditionalists may linger and oppose new ideas. Christian historians will likely deepen their understanding of the faith, seeking to distinguish later additions from Jesus' original intentions. Eventually, a strong movement will emerge to strip away these additions, reverting Christianity to its initial form. As this trend spreads in the United States and Europe, masses may return to worshipping as they did during Jesus' time, guided by his ideas alone. Although this could lead to increased uniformity within Christianity, the institutional church will remain strong. Throughout history, we've seen reversals, such as when Christianity went from being persecuted by the Roman Empire to becoming its dominant religion. The impending reversion in Christianity will follow this pattern, simplifying the faith and reducing its diversity. This transformation will be aided by interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically rather than literally. Looking back through history, Judaism was the precursor to Christianity, centered around monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures before the Romans controlled Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. Jews were diverse, categorized into groups like Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, and Zealots, along with a majority of common people.",
            "I contend that \"The Jungle\" by Upton Sinclair illustrates the inherent greed and self-interest of human nature. Individuals prioritize their own well-being and success, disregarding those beneath them. This theme is evident in the factory owners and managers, whose sole aim is to expand their empires, without regard for the harm caused by their actions. Sinclair's description of the factories \"a line of buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky, with great chimneys pouring out rivers of smoke\" underscores the environmental damage they inflict. The owners' apathy towards the suffering of people and animals, whether from pollution or harsh working conditions, is apparent. They prioritize profits over worker safety, as seen in their exploitative labor practices and absence of compensation for layoffs. Laws and regulations during that time offered little protection, allowing managers and owners to exploit their employees in substandard conditions. Workers were essentially trapped in this system, with no recourse or assistance, and were often forced to work to the point of death. Unions, while formed to help, often compounded the workers' misery by enriching themselves. Sinclair's comparison of workers to slaves highlights their desperate plight, unable to escape the brutal system that left them \"hanging always on the verge of starvation, dependent for opportunities of life upon the whim of men as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers\"",
            "Many authors employ various methods to evoke specific emotions or perspectives in their readers. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his novel \"The Great Gatsby,\" employs a number of these techniques with varying degrees of effectiveness. One approach he uses is to pair adjectives and nouns in unusual combinations to create a particular atmosphere. Additionally, he assigns symbolic significance to colors and reuses these symbols to reinforce his narrative. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald attributes specific meanings to colors like white/gray and red/pink, which he then employs to evoke particular sensations around key subjects.\n\nFitzgerald's association of white/gray with uniformity is evident in his use of these colors throughout the novel. White is often associated with higher social status and elegance, while gray signifies age and faded appearances. This is first established at the novel's outset with frequent mentions of white and gray. Characters such as Daisy and Jordan are consistently described as \"in white,\" and even minor characters like Nick, Tom, and Catherine are depicted in white attire. Furthermore, Fitzgerald employs these colors to describe mundane subjects, enhancing their significance. For instance, Nick travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York,\" and the names of partygoers are \"gray names.\" Even simple objects and settings, like apartment houses and cars, are described in terms of white and gray, reinforcing their symbolism.\n\nAfter establishing the meanings of white/gray, Fitzgerald uses them to convey a sense of uniformity or insignificance. This technique begins with Daisy, who is first described as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster.\" This use of white diminishes her character status, making her seem more like a uniform addition, an object of Gatsby's desire. Fitzgerald continues to use this technique with Daisy, such as describing her \"gray haze of fur collar\" and her outfit as \"white\" before her encounter with Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County is exceptionally fertile due to its mild and sunny climate. Common crops include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits such as peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a strong demand for organic community supported agriculture (CSA) in the San Diego region, with many local organizations boasting long waiting lists for their services. Organic eggs and milk are also popular purchases. Many organic farms offer tours of their operations and access to recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching. This setup allows landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitat, promoting recreational use, and creating opportunities for farm tours and educational programs.\n\nOrganic farming typically offers greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemicals. However, it can be more labor-intensive and costly than conventional farming, as it requires intensive management to control pests and weeds and maintain soil fertility without chemicals. Additionally, organic farms may experience higher losses and lack the economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations. Certain practices beneficial to wildlife, like planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, and invasive species removal, also require more labor. Therefore, landowners in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expertise to balance profit and habitat quality.\n\nThe land in question is a 160-acre parcel near Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. This land includes chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, and is part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion in the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan currently recognizes over a hundred species of plants and animals, with many being endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, and others are declining and may soon be listed as endangered, like burrowing owls.\n\nThis land has a rich history of habitation by Native Americans for centuries and was later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. It was part of an original homestead and likely used for grazing and wood production for many years. After researching available government programs, a model organic farm in the same area was identified as a potential example of what could be achieved with this land.",
            "Culture is a crucial factor in any negotiation. It can be understood as much by its absence as by its presence and significance. Culture is not uniform or isolated. Blanket statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are too simplistic. While it's helpful to grasp the general traits of a culture, a skilled negotiator should focus on how the culture's attitudes affect the negotiation process. When encountering a foreign culture, it's natural to relate it to one's own culture, leading to inevitable comparisons. Understanding a foreign culture or mindset may involve delving into its history, understanding its biases, and accepting it for what it is, rather than trying to change it. This is especially important if you're in a weaker bargaining position or in \"away\" territory. Cultural nuances extend beyond national borders, as individual companies often have their own distinct cultures, influencing factors like work hours, communication styles, and hiring practices. Some companies may encourage or restrict employee philanthropy. Even cultures that appear uniform can have deep layers. Understanding a culture's values, which provide its \"why,\" is equally important. For instance, if a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator will refrain from public humiliation. Similarly, a negotiator from a culture that values aggressive bargaining will not relent easily. Before negotiation, it's beneficial to learn about one's opponent's personal background to enhance the process.",
            "The statement \"There is no God\" was supposedly made by a fool, as written in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is the starting point for St. Anselm's argument about God's existence. This belief is shared by another author we'll discuss, Thomas Aquinas. Since both are defending the same idea, and we're to compare their arguments, we'll assume they both believe in the Bible's God for simplicity's sake. Assuming any other god wouldn't allow a fair comparison, as their arguments are specific to this concept. However, both arguments fall short of providing a comprehensive basis for believing in God. To illustrate this, let's first look at St. Anselm's main argument. He proposes that we find truth about God within our own understanding. He argues that because we can't imagine God's non-existence, we can thereby prove his existence. This idea, though complex, suggests that the proof for God lies within our own minds, not requiring external evidence. This is often referred to as faith in Christian texts. In contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas advocates for proving God's existence through reason and empirical evidence alone, without needing faith. His five logical arguments, including change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony, suggest that God's existence can be deduced from logic.",
            "Around the 5th or 6th century BCE, a future Buddha was born. He left the worldly life, achieved enlightenment, and his teachings eventually led to the formation of Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being the most traditional branch. This religion is now about 2500 years old and has evolved significantly since Buddha's time, evident in practices like the annual water-cutting ceremony in Sri Lanka, where monks and laypeople participate despite Buddha not teaching such rituals. These changes span from superficial traditions to the religion's core beliefs. Theravada Buddhism, both from the monastic and lay perspectives, has had to adapt its doctrines over time due to both external and internal influences, both friendly and hostile.\n\nThroughout this discussion, several terms will be used. Internal forces are those originating from within the Buddhist community, while external forces come from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces harm or intend to harm Buddhism, while benign forces do not wish to harm the community but may inadvertently do so. These terms will be frequently used.\n\nFirst, let's explore the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists find refuge in the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma includes the Tripitaka, three collections of texts: the Sutta Pitaka (containing Suttas), the Vinaya Pitaka (disciplinary rules), and the Abhidhamma Pitaka (metaphysical concepts like Anatta, Dukkha, and Anicca). Understanding these concepts helps one break the cycle of Sansara (death and rebirth), along with its components: lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). When one becomes enlightened, these cease. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for laypeople (five precepts) and monks (many more). Fundamental to Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome, and there is a way to achieve this.",
            "America and Mexico once had a long-standing rivalry that lasted from 1836 to 1893, with the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848 serving as the peak of their conflict. Other disputes also occurred between the two nations, with the rivalry subsiding just before World War I. The animosity began due to disagreements over religion, culture, and economic interests, not unlike many border-sharing nations. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that only Mexico and Cuba posed long-term challenges to U.S. diplomacy due to their proximity and rivalry. Religious tensions, rooted in historic distrust between the English and Spanish, were a significant obstacle to friendly relations. Diehl and Goerts (2000) enumerate 17 disputes, mainly involving territorial issues caused by raids and outlaw activities across the border. Schmitt (1974) attributes the easing of the rivalry to Mexico's growing dependence on the U.S. and the shift in American aims from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was unexpectedly struck by a previously unknown illness that left me disabled. At the time, I was a nurse, having chosen this career to ensure safety and security, driven by my childhood experiences and the reassuring mantra that \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" Even though my dream was to become a scientist or journalist, I chose nursing. Yet, here I am, at 46 years old, single, and unable to work. After 15 years on Social Security Disability, I have nothing to call my own, and daily struggles assault my sense of security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, but I know that without the support of my family and some good friends, I wouldn't have lasted this long. When disaster truly strikes, you feel incredibly weak, no matter how strong you are.\n\nMy point is that life throws emergencies at us, big and small, and no matter how well we prepare, some challenges are too great to face alone. While I agree that Americans should not rely solely on big government, I believe we should instead focus on rebuilding trust and mutual support. The Conservatives in the U.S. praise \"rugged individualism\" as the foundation of our country, but our forefathers' resilience came from compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources. Pioneers didn't cross the Rockies alone in wagon trains.\n\nTherefore, while I advocate for preparation, I also urge you to connect with your neighbors and form a support network. I have a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and other essentials. If you have the ability and resources, consider starting a small farm and preserving your own food, or even having a wood stove, but always remember that building a strong community is equally important.",
            "Why do organisms change over time? What factors influence the direction of their evolution? While in 1917 D'Arcy Thompson remarked that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" this sentiment still holds true today. Recently, mathematical modeling has been used to study general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis across both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research aims to explore how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help understand the mechanisms behind the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental changes. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters, which were then used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies with the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). These models, along with experimental and descriptive studies, help us better grasp macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a structure that moves through 360 degrees of space over time. These loops or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis called the columella. The rate at which whorls enlarge can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl, known as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last, called the body whorl. The spire consists of all whorls except the last, with the apex being the tip and the base the opposite end. The aperture is the opening through which the animal extends out of its shell.\n\nShells can be viewed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The \"usual\" orientation is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves first viewing the shell from the apical perspective and determining where the first suture begins. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell into two parts, from which whorls are counted and estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that traverse through time and space as the animal grows its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced using the coordinates of the centers of each whorl's aperture, as well as the horizontal and vertical radii of the aperture. This trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is established, parameters can be varied and modified to alter the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have remained relatively unchanged over the past decade. While the nation is progressing towards several Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, the progress in child and maternal health lags behind what's needed to meet the 2015 goals. This disparity is due to several factors, suggesting that it's crucial to bolster the overall healthcare system rather than focusing solely on specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% now meeting this criterion. However, these skilled workers often include traditional midwives who are unable to handle medical interventions, leading to higher maternal mortality due to complications like hemorrhage. This improvement is somewhat misleading, as there's still significant work to be done. Additionally, the percentage of children under five receiving professional treatment for diarrhea has decreased, and there are concerns about postnatal care, as data is incomplete but shows low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean section rates remain low at 4%, with a notable disparity between urban (7%) and rural (2%) settings. This highlights an issue of healthcare access, with most services concentrated in urban areas. Further, there's a significant gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles (27%), indicating that the poor face greater barriers in accessing healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering strategies to enhance neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is which approach is most effective in addressing the lack of services. Should Indonesia prioritize program-specific interventions or strengthen the overall healthcare system without targeting pre- and postnatal care for mothers and children? While programmatic approaches offer targeted, manageable goals and faster results, they also have drawbacks. Heavy investment in specific areas can lead to funding shortages and human resource imbalances, potentially causing program duplication and increased paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "Victorian novels are distinguished by their meticulous attention to detail and focus on the aristocracy of the era. Two exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, unlike other novels of the time, which enhances the characters' development. These novels often employ dream sequences or dreamlike states to convey mystery, which serves different purposes in each case.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, these dreamlike sequences provide insights into Oliver's inner turmoil, revealing his emotional and psychological state, as well as his awareness of the true nature of events around him. For instance, when he relives the shooting in Chapter 28, it feels like a dream, highlighting Oliver’s lack of control over his fate and the desperate state of his health. The passage emphasizes his inability to regain control of the situation, as he doesn’t notice the unseen force that takes him away, and he experiences constant, fear-driven pain. This event suggests that Oliver has little agency over his life and that his despair is growing, potentially due to the influence of Fagin. It implies that if Oliver had any capacity to react, he would have tried to save himself, but he is overwhelmed and defeated.\n\nThe day passed – the day seemed to pass – and night fell again; night that was long and silent, yet brief, like a fleeting dream.",
            "A few years ago, I worked in an after-school tutoring program for elementary students. While I assisted them in various subjects, my proficiency was greatest in English and reading. A colleague asked me to help a boy named Adrian, who was having significant difficulty with reading. I soon realized that Adrian understood some letters perfectly but struggled with others, which seemed unusual. Adrian was of Latino descent and spoke fluent English, which made his situation puzzling. We faced challenges until I met Adrian's mother. During a field trip, she arrived to pick him up, and I realized she spoke only Spanish. With my limited Spanish, we managed to communicate, and I discovered that Adrian could read but was unfamiliar with the English alphabet. I don't know if this insight helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nThis story highlights the complex issue of language barriers in schools, particularly in California. Even a child who speaks perfect English might struggle with reading due to unfamiliarity with the English alphabet. This problem is evident, and while solutions exist, they are not straightforward. For children like Adrian, who spoke fluent English but needed help with the alphabet, tutoring was effective. For those who speak little to no English, the challenge is more complex.\n\nThe dual language system could be beneficial. While it's often feared to be resource-intensive and ineffective for most students, research shows that children in these programs outperform their peers. However, implementing it as a standard practice rather than an exception would benefit all students. Special bilingual aides or tutors can help, but requiring all teachers to be bilingual isn't practical. Combining different approaches, such as dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes, is key to addressing this issue.",
            "From a young age, many of us are taught about something beyond our comprehension, often through religious instruction or personal introspection. While some embrace the faith of their parents, others reject it, preferring their own perspective. Regardless of our chosen path, we strive to define our spirituality through our unique views. We seek guidance in the darkness to lead us into the light.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father replied when I asked about his favorite type of bird. We sat on our porch, listening to the rain as we shared cigarettes. The gutters overflowed, drenching the plants along the edge. He gazed into the rain, his eyes reflecting a mix of searching and reminiscing. He appeared thinner, his hair less dense than before. I was overwhelmed by his condition and struggled to discuss how much I'd miss him. Instead, I hugged him and sat closer, joining him in watching the rain.\n\nMy father passed away in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday.

            "The \"Gothic Novel\" is, in essence and name, an \"old-new\" oxymoron, as Ian Watt describes in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been both criticized and praised, accused of lacking depth and celebrated for its 'terrible sublime' quality (Burke). The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, combined the ideas of ancient and modern romances to create the proto-Gothic genre and a new mode of literary expression. Walpole employed old theatrical elements and modern mimicking of nature in contemporary novels to present what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre continues to draw upon medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, despite the term \"gothic\" originally being used to describe various peoples, styles, and time periods. Initially seen as archaic or unsophisticated against \"modern\" societal and literary advancements, the blend of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the novel format that allowed readers a deeper look into characters' psychology has enabled Gothic literature to endure and remain both obsolete and fresh to readers from different time periods.\n\nOne key idea present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, training a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is significant to Gothic writers because it embodies the ideal of a brave, honorable, and competent knight, and the perceived or supposed lack of such qualities in contemporary society. By employing chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, hinting at Gothic's evolution towards Romanticism, and used to strive for improvement in the present. Writing during a politically turbulent time and possibly despondent over the future, Walpole may have felt that the morality and inherent goodness present in the gothic era had been lost in contemporary society. This perspective is evident in several characters, such as Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits. Before meeting Frederic, he is described as a:\n\nThe description of him includes traditional chivalric elements: Frederic is a prince, has suffered tragedies, and is presumed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, introducing the soon-to-be typical Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves the series of steps that take an order from a customer back through the stages of raw materials, production, and distribution, delivering the product to the customer. The term was coined by Keith Oliver in 1982 as a way to describe the planning, execution, and control of the supply chain to meet customer needs efficiently. Six key components make up a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these components to enhance customer service. Production, the first step, forms the basis for the entire supply chain. It involves deciding what, when, where, and how to produce goods based on customer demand, which is typically determined by market analysis. Managers must consider market conditions and customer preferences to decide on the products to produce and their quantities. They also need to choose the optimal location for production, balancing volume, quality, and cost. After setting the production location, managers focus on scheduling and equipment maintenance. This step is crucial as every detail impacts the overall process. For instance, retail giants like Wal-Mart and Target have detailed processes and procedures for every aspect of their operations, reducing confusion and ensuring smooth workflow. Supply, the second key element, involves making strategic decisions about facility capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Companies may have multiple divisions for a single product, each with unique equipment, workers, and expertise. Managers must select the best division for each product process. Outsourcing can help achieve velocity, the ability to provide quality and flexibility while controlling costs.",
            "Hitler exists in Burma, according to the sign.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone at a street corner with a cardboard sign above her head, bearing a disturbing message written in Sharpie. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation controlled by an oppressive military regime that took power through a coup d'état in 1962. In 2007, public protests led by Buddhist monks, dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution,\" occurred following a decade of silence. Initially, the Burmese government tolerated the monks' peaceful demonstrations, but it soon escalated into a violent conflict with the military. Foreign journalists were detained and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed on September 27th, 2007, for covering the protests. The official death toll stands at 13, but Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army, claimed thousands had been killed.\n\nThis is not a new phenomenon. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over their citizens. Early Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, Japanese emperors were believed to be gods, and U.S. President George W. Bush supposedly had weekly meetings with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a Conservative Party affiliate.\n\nFamous examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students protested the government's authoritarian rule, with official reports ranging from 200-3,000 dead. The Rwandan genocide in the 1990s saw Hutu militia groups, backed by the Rwandan government, systematically kill Tutsis and political moderates. Hitler's Third Reich, a period spanning several years and countries, resulted in widespread persecution and murder of Jews.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence in jazz is largely due to his longevity and his ability to guide his orchestra. Although his piano playing is often subtle, Ellington excelled as a composer, crafting intricate pieces that highlighted the unique talents of his band members. He created a framework that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also writing pieces that showcased the specific styles of his players. This approach not only emphasized the tone of the orchestra as a whole but also resulted in some of the most innovative and brilliant jazz compositions of all time.\n\nThe Grove Music Dictionary highlights Ellington's sound and innovation by referencing \"Creole Love Call.\" This piece, which uses the voice as a jazz instrument, demonstrates Ellington’s early use of vocal texture and color without lyrics. The piece, a slow twelve-bar blues with six choruses, showcases several soloists, including a muted trumpet, clarinet, and his voice itself. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded the following year, Ellington's orchestration and ear for tone color are evident in a call and response between a muted trumpet and scat singing. The song \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further exemplifies this, with Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton using his muted trombone to introduce the melody.",
            "She had always felt a void, a longing that remained unfulfilled. This feeling began when she was 14, entering her teenage years, and persisted at 17, even though she had decided she wanted someone rather than an object. Despite boys being drawn to her, none sparkled her interest. She often wondered why this was, but her thoughts didn't yield satisfying theories. So, she lived her life, always curious about her desires.\n\nAt home, life was usually serene.

The hospital's antiseptic scent filled the air, but her mind was focused solely on helping her mother.\n\nHer mother had lost her balance while climbing a step stool to reach a high cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that sticking closely to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), measured by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", correlates with a reduced likelihood of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related deaths. The aMed diet is a variant of the Med diet that emphasizes higher consumption of plant-based foods (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (over saturated fats), and fish, while limiting intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious observational studies have shown an inverse relationship between adherence to the Med diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial also found that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in overweight individuals. Prior studies did not specifically focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 years, who were part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. Over six periods from 1984 to 2004, researchers calculated an aMed diet score using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) to assess nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of nurses maintained their involvement throughout the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. Where documentation was unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better capture long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (by averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for potential confounding factors (variables that could skew results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a severe financial crisis, characterized by rising unemployment, a collapsed housing market, and the demise of many prominent financial institutions. This economic downturn continues today, prompting the question: what caused this crisis, and how can we prevent future occurrences? The crisis was largely a result of shortsighted and self-interested political decisions that compelled banks and corporations to issue sub-prime loans within an inadequately developed financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to back and repack these mortgages into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and credit default swaps (CDS). When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves, which led them to transfer the resulting turmoil onto the repackaged mortgages and into the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of the financial crisis were planted during the Clinton administration in 1999, as the president sought a second term. To boost his popularity, he loosened lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime mortgage crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times warned at the time, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's leading home mortgage underwriter, faced pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage lending to low and moderate-income individuals, and faced pressure from shareholders to maintain its remarkable profit growth.\" Holmes accurately predicted the consequences, stating, \"The government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, requiring a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As the introduction mentions, and Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending led to the economic collapse.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the complex structures of mortgages. The widespread use of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) in the years leading up to the crisis further interwove different sectors of the economy with the housing market. This increased leverage made U.S. households and financial markets highly sensitive to even minor price fluctuations. When the housing bubble burst, financial institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities suffered significant losses. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for around 30% of the USA’s GDP. Ultimately, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dissolved, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become heavily regulated commercial banks. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Exposition: The section of your narrative where you spread your wings and captivate your audience with your enthralling prose, or where you risk losing your readers' attention. Dr. Merlin has had her share of frustration while dealing with this part, often finding herself amidst a flurry of unnecessary details. Despite the well-known advice to \"show, not tell,\" many writers, including Dr. Merlin, still struggle with exposition, often giving too much background information too quickly.\n\nExposition is the part where you simply inform the audience about past events, often in straightforward language. In movies, it's when one character shares a long monologue of information, like \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, this is done by the author.\n\nConsider this example: While reading a story, you're told that the main character met her love, got married, and then lost him. You wouldn't expect this entire backstory to take up two pages with limited dialogue. Instead, you'd expect the author to flesh out the husband's character, showing his love for his wife through his words and actions. The same goes for the heroine, where her character should be evident through her interactions with him. This way, you'd feel the emotional impact of his death and connect with the heroine's experience more deeply.\n\nIn essence, you need to add substance to the bare facts of the story. Sometimes, the urge to rush through certain details is strong. Perhaps you're introducing a new character who was once in the Air Force, now runs a gas station, has been married twice, likes fishing, dreams of owning the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast. Instead of just stating these facts, incorporate them into the character's actions and dialogue.",
            "I tuned in to two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first live broadcast was from NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story reported a man named Shad Hostettler who stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. They aired his mug shot, and he appeared to have a menacing appearance. The story was given minimal coverage, dedicating only about two minutes to it. The details were scant, mentioning only that he had stabbed her multiple times and was arrested. I think the time spent was appropriate.\n\nThe second story was about a young man named Travis Buyers, 18, who had been critically injured in a shooting in the Sharon Woods area. There were no arrests or suspects at the time, and the SWAT team was investigating. This story seemed rushed, and I believe this could be due to it involving a minority individual. I've often noticed that crimes against minorities are less frequently reported or receive less attention. On the other hand, crimes against whites, especially children, are often heavily covered by the media.\n\nThe next story discussed a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given on the incident's location, and it was determined to be a .22 caliber rifle bullet. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThe following story warned about rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They mentioned temperatures would be in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The report was brief but served as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nAnother story covered a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man, about six feet tall and weighing 150 pounds, dressed in a hoodie sweatshirt. The story seemed to emphasize his race and skin color more than necessary.\n\nThe final story discussed Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin sentenced for distributing marijuana in large quantities from Texas to Ohio. Instead of saying 25 years, they mentioned 300 months. It's unclear why they used this phrasing, possibly to make it sound more severe. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, which seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "The bond between brothers is profound and unshakable, encompassing a range of emotions such as love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers possess a deep understanding of each other, often seeing themselves reflected in their siblings. This intimate bond is most evident in dire situations, where both positive and negative emotions can be exposed. Understanding the complexities of this fraternal bond involves acknowledging the consequences that come with it. By looking into a brother's eyes, one sees not how they are perceived by others, but their true self. Their character is revealed through their actions and the consequences of those actions. In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers delve into this theme, facing the turmoil of their emotions in a vividly described landscape. A climax of bitterness and intense pride leads to one brother's demise. The story explores this theme through the protagonist's, Doodle's, direct characterization and their interactions, as well as the narrator's perspective, which conveys the protagonist's feelings and his worldview, significantly influencing his actions. The protagonist's motivations can be distilled to a single emotion: pride. Starting from their first outing together to their final, fateful trip, he harbors resentment towards Doodle. He longed for a brother who could learn and participate in various activities like holding his breath, running, or climbing trees, but Doodle's heart condition made this impossible. The protagonist initially feels anger towards Doodle, even considering harming him at one point, yet a simple smile from Doodle melts his heart, revealing his underlying love and weaker resolve.",
            "The human brain is an intricate, innovative information-processing system. As technology evolved from primitive to advanced, so did the metaphors used to represent the brain. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, followed by a book, and most recently, a computer. As you delve into understanding the brain, keep in mind the limited usefulness of these metaphors and their potential to lead to incorrect conclusions.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory organs converting physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or light into electrochemical signals. This sensory information is repeatedly transformed through the brain's algorithms in both bottom-up and top-down processes. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing compiles simple data like color, orientation, and border changes to identify the box. Top-down processing utilizes decisions from these bottom-up processes to accelerate recognition of the box. In this example, top-down processing might help you classify the object as a black box rather than a hole.\n\nOnce information is processed, an attention filter determines its importance and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. Conversely, you might pick out your name even in a noisy room. The processing of information involves multiple stages, with results repeatedly modulated by attention.\n\nTo process information, the brain must first store it. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Information is initially encoded based on its type of sensory input. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally (how the word looks), phonemically (how it sounds), or semantically (what it means). Once stored, information must be maintained. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which holds information for about 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons for a short duration. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are numerous theories on how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on human memory retrieval, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that knowledge is organized into nodes representing concepts, with nodes linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the impending threat of technology and capitalism through his dystopian novel, Brave New World. The societal structure prioritizes community over individuality and promotes immediate happiness, conditioning citizens from birth. People are pawns in a larger system dictated by the World Controller. Examining the novel through Marxist lenses reveals Huxley's concerns about these developments. The novel employs Marxist terms like homogenization and reification to highlight issues with the emerging capitalistic economy. Capitalism is satirized through the concept of false consciousness, where the common people are kept unaware of their true economic relations and focused solely on personal gain. This is achieved through ideological control, evident in the conditioning of people in Brave New World. Lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, have no autonomy, with hypnopædia reinforcing their desires to consume. Hegemony, where a group dominates another, is also present in the World State. The lower classes are unaware of this manipulation, 'buying into' the ideology that supports capitalism. Upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, are aware but accept their position. The novel's lack of meaningful relationships between characters and the superficiality of interactions reflect the loss of free will and expression. Love and strong emotions are absent, as are meaningful interactions; men discuss women's physical appearance, and women discuss their encounters. Each class's acceptance of their status in the hierarchy illustrates the socioeconomic impact of capitalism, with people believing they are superior due to their consumption and obedience.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for roughly 2.5 years, which equates to about 4.5 semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many students, including myself. During my freshman year, I was assigned a dorm room in East Halls, the farthest eastward point on campus (excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center). Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in locations like the Willard building, situated near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes, especially in bad weather, which is common in State College. An alumnus, not much older than me, shared that in the past, the East Halls dorms were secluded by large tracts of empty land. Today, that space is occupied by sports fields, new buildings such as the new Creamery and health services building, and apartments, as the campus continues to expand, making it increasingly difficult to move from one place to another. The most effective solution for this mobility issue is cycling, but simply having bikes isn't enough. Students need to use them, and the campus must be designed to accommodate cyclists. My friend who recently resumed cycling after a few years mentioned that he couldn't understand why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “they’re the only viable way to get around.” Cycling is not only efficient but also beneficial for one's health. A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of physical exertion can cover 30 miles or more. Like many students, I now reside off campus, just as far from the center as some dorms. The best decision I made this year was to buy a bike. My daily class in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my home, can be reduced to 5 minutes by cycling. The main problem is that Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, isn't always easy to navigate on a bike. Although walking also has its merits, I don't have the time. Without a bike, walking would be my only dependable option for getting to class. Daily walks to Thomas would consume an extra 30-40 minutes, totaling around 2.5 hours a week. Adding the time spent walking to and from other classes, appointments, and so forth, that's more time than I can afford to spare."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "This document examines the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to insomnia. The Biological model centers on inherited genetic factors and medical aspects of health. Sociocultural models, on the other hand, explore environmental influences related to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The ensuing review evaluates insomnia and other primary sleep disorders through these models, explaining each selected study and critiquing its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified as primary, secondary to another mental disorder, or resulting from other health issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while those linked to mental disorders are associated with Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorders may be due to medical complications or substance use. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and unspecified Dyssomnias. Primary Insomnia is characterized by difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia involves challenges in staying awake. Narcolepsy involves symptoms like cataplexy or automatic REM sleep. Parasomnias are characterized by behavioral abnormalities or physiological events during sleep, including Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and unspecified Parasomnias. Sleep disorders related to mental disorders involve sleep difficulties associated with clinical (Axis I) or personality (Axis II) disorders.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genes, inherited traits, and physiological aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study using mice discovered that GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are responsible for sleep-wake states. Activation of GABAA receptors promotes sleep, while inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. Baclofen, a GABAB agonist, increased sleep duration in the study. This suggests that findings from animal models can be generalized to humans, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for GABAB receptors. Impairments in these receptors could hinder adequate sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if the genetic trait is inherited, it could influence sleep, and alterations in the receptor could disrupt sleep, negatively impacting daily life activities.",

Finally, it offers suggestions for how teachers in inclusive classrooms can support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) refers to the efficiency and effectiveness of the central nervous system (CNS) in utilizing auditory information. Specifically, (C)AP involves the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the underlying neurobiological activity that generates electrophysiological auditory potentials. In essence, it is a condition where the brain cannot properly process what is heard. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally but struggle with separating words or distinguishing conversations from background noise.\n\nThe earliest reference to the condition, initially called \"auditory imperception,\" dates back to the mid-1950s when researchers were studying children with communication disorders. The Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing diagnostic tests in 1954, while Kimura introduced dichotic testing in 1961 to explain the physiological basis of dichotic perception. A national conference in 1977 further stimulated research on CAPD.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways: individuals may have difficulty localizing or hearing sounds in space, discriminating between multiple sounds, recognizing sound patterns, differentiating changes in speech (such as detecting sarcasm from tone changes), having sounds blocked by subsequent sounds, synthesizing sound clues meaningfully, or determining the sequence of auditory information. Diagnosis of CAPD involves systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function, which can be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others. There is no single test or tool that consistently identifies CAPD, and its cause is unknown. Many diagnostic tests present patients with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and ask them to differentiate specific items, such as words or numbers. Advanced tests record acoustic signals within the ear and measure responses.",
            "In \"Twelfth Night,\" it appears that while disguise can aid in maintaining prolonged deception, ultimately, one must discard this new persona or risk losing their true identity. Disclosing a lie can also lead to estrangement. Therefore, individuals must choose between self-preservation or maintaining relationships with others. While some may respond calmly to being deceived, others may be offended. The topic of gender role reversal in deception raises complex issues, particularly the question of why one might feel compelled to adopt the other gender's appearance. In Viola's case, it serves as a means of self-defense in a foreign land: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249) Her plan succeeds, but she becomes isolated from women, cutting off an important support system. Furthermore, she inadvertently attracts romantic feelings from Olivia, who mistakes her for Sebastian. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) Viola also grapples with suppressed romantic feelings towards Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261) While this can be seen as progressive, modern readers might interpret Twelfth Night as a depiction of how deception can reveal hidden emotions, especially in Olivia and Orsino. Passages suggest that these characters may harbor unexpressed subconscious desires forced to the surface by Viola/Cesario's presence. For example, Olivia's love for Cesario could be due to his male appearance, or it might reveal deeper feelings towards women. However, it's likely that Olivia's attraction to Cesario is more about appearances, as Shakespeare's characters often judge based on looks. This is evident in Olivia's swift shift from loving Cesario to regarding Cesario/Viola as family rather than a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "German colonial rule has been widely recognized for its harshness, particularly in regard to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. While it's impossible to summarize an entire colonial empire so simplistically, the German colonial empire exhibited a remarkable diversity in its policies and administration, as well as in its educational approaches. Educational systems varied greatly across colonies. When the British took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a considerable number of educated and literate Africans. German educational initiatives in Cameroon and other colonies were also commended by contemporary authors. The contrast in South West Africa (now Namibia) was stark. Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a key role in the education of natives, in South West Africa, the task of educating natives was largely left to missionary societies that received minimal government support. The government did invest heavily in the education of Europeans, setting up a system of state schools and providing more support and regulation for missionary schools. These policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies had significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Numerous social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience in South West Africa. This paper aims to broaden the discussion by identifying these factors and focusing on new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities toward native Africans.\n\nThere is a substantial body of literature about education in the German colonial empire, much of it in German and written either during or shortly after the colonial era. Earlier works mainly aimed to describe the educational systems in these colonies, while later works, often in English, expanded the discourse through comparative studies and in-depth analyses. These studies highlighted the differences in educational systems across colonies. The most notable work addressing this topic is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors accounting for their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa explains many of the unique aspects of its educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial territories, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of it is covered by arid desert. This climate was reflected in a European population that was relatively hospitable, with nearly 15,000 whites in South West Africa by 1913, compared to around 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has expanded significantly over the past century, encompassing numerous genres that are hard to enumerate exhaustively. This complexity is further compounded by the fact that many of these genres, such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have spawned numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. In particular, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has emerged as one of the most diverse and expressive genres in Popular Music over the last 40 years. Its expressiveness stems from its broad emotional range, which often leans towards darker hues. Additionally, the genre's flexibility has led to the creation of numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, creating a continuous chain of evolution. Today, the heavy metal scene is so fragmented that it's challenging to define what constitutes heavy metal, as it has absorbed themes from various other genres. To grasp the contemporary metal music scene, one must first understand the metal movement's origins and its nature as a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nHeavy metal, in many respects, is defined by its darkness. It can be seen as \"music with more\" — more bass, more volume, more aggression, and more theatricality. It emphasizes instrumental prowess, with musicians demonstrating their proficiency. Moreover, metal has a strong association with drug use, particularly psychedelic drugs in the 1970s, which allowed musicians to explore more extreme, otherworldly sounds. This genre possesses dark, visceral qualities, which was unusual for popular music at the time, as it strayed from more upbeat themes. Later generations of metal musicians have drawn inspiration from these dark, visceral qualities, which are reminiscent of the Romantic Era. Lyrics like those from \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles exemplify this darkness and are considered one of the early Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song and marked The Beatles' attempt to match the Stones' heavier, darker sound on their album \"The White Album\".",
            "Several years before Surrealist artists began creating their dream-like works, Henri Rousseau was already crafting his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. \"The Dream,\" a 1910 painting by the renowned Post-Impressionist artist, showcases not only a woman enchanted by the wonders of a dream landscape but also Rousseau's personal dreams and ambitions as an artist. Throughout his career, Rousseau yearned for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet he faced a challenging internal conflict: to conform to or imitate established painting styles to gain acceptance in the critical art world or to retain his creative independence and uniqueness. \"The Dream\" embodies Rousseau's lifelong internal struggle. Prior to examining \"The Dream\" through this lens, one should be familiar with Rousseau's biography. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Rousseau's father ran a successful tinsmith and hardware business. He lacked formal art training but worked as a gabelou (employee of the municipal toll service) until age forty, earning the nickname douanier (customs inspector). After the deaths of his wife and infant children, Rousseau turned to painting for solace and new beginnings. Unlike his contemporaries, Rousseau was a folk painter, echoing the hopes and dreams of the common people. Understanding Rousseau's desire for artistic acceptance is not surprising given his lack of formal training, late start, and the presence of many esteemed artists working concurrently. While he and Matisse were rivals in the art world, they differed in painting styles, subjects, and motivations. According to Jan Gordon in \"Modern French Painters,\" Matisse feared painting tritely, whereas Rousseau aimed to create something conventional enough to gain admission into the Artiste Français.",
            "Many prominent thinkers have proposed a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, and truth and beauty. I contend that this connection has a fundamental reason. John Keats, in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" asserts that \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of our knowledge comes from education or experience, we intuitively appreciate ethics and aesthetics without formal teaching. Both ethics and aesthetics seek to describe rather than prescribe. Our analyses of morality and beauty are primarily attempts to explain the reasons behind something's beauty or morality, not to dictate rules for creating good art or moral behavior. Critiquing art or morals can't fully capture their essence. For instance, discussing the worth of Da Vinci's Mona Lisa may involve aspects like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't explain why it's good art. Often, when discussing a favorite piece of art or literature, we hear phrases like, \"There's just something about it\" before delving into more complex explanations. Both art and morality cannot be fully reduced to descriptions of their qualities, as there's always a transcendent element, as Flannery O'Connor and Wittgenstein suggest. I believe this shared transcendent nature binds ethics and aesthetics together. I posit that we experience both morality and art most potently in a way that's ineffable, or beyond explanation, at a noumenal level. This is especially true for literature, which uniquely combines moral quality with its aesthetic appeal, as McKean observes.",
            "Germany today is recognized as a powerful and unified nation, with a distinctive culture that varies from the alpine region of Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel, and from Cologne along the Rhine River to the central region and the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. This cultural diversity is not surprising given that Germany has evolved from a mix of different tribes and sources. The land of Germania, the ancestral home of the Germans, has an uncertain origin. Some scholars suggest it comes from the Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before crossing the Rhine and fighting against Gallic forces, as noted by Tacitus in AD 98. Others propose that the name derives from the German weapon, the ger, or from the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans' loud nature. The early Roman historian Tacitus, in his writings, argued that the Germans were indigenous and had not mixed with other races through immigration or contact. He described Germany as a place with harsh conditions, which might not attract immigrants from more hospitable climates like Asia, Africa, or Italy. The Romans primarily traded with the Germanic tribes, with occasional military campaigns, but mostly returned home to their empire. As Germanic tribes began appearing in the first century, they lived on the Roman Empire's borders, trading their goods and skills within the Roman army.",
            "I gazed down, my mind empty, observing the scene before me. Impassively, silently, with a practiced detachment that analyzed the picture without connecting to any abstract understanding, my mind processed the image. Thoughts flickered through my mind, but they were ephemeral and fleeting, like a quick and smooth flow of consciousness. I couldn't relate to the picture as an artist would, but rather experienced it as a passive observer. I had always wanted to draw, and I had once bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" which taught everything from understanding a pencil to how the brain interprets lines. One technique it taught was to frame a square around a picture to simplify it, turning a complex scene into a manageable one. Looking at the bowl of fruit in front of me, I couldn't mentally frame the picture. I was too overwhelmed, too awestruck to process it. I was standing at the beginning of what could be my artistic journey, my \"Work in Brown.\" My hand touched the brush, muscles tensed and relaxed as I moved it through space, giving form to my thoughts. Water swirled smoothly, clear and clean. Small bits of matter broke away, floating away. Flush after flush, I struggled to dislodge the stubborn brown package. Frustrated, I gripped the mop and began to wrap it around my hand like a glove. Standing tall, I slowly dipped my hand into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Teenagers are dying in car accidents at an alarming rate due to a combination of factors. The National Institutes of Health point out that a key issue is the immaturity of the teenage brain, which is not yet fully capable of handling the hazards of driving. Lack of experience also plays a significant role, leading to more crashes, rollovers, speeding incidents, and off-road accidents. Teenagers are particularly at risk when they drive with peers, as studies have shown a correlation between the number of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents.\n\nSeveral states have tried to enhance teen driver safety by implementing provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and forbid minors as passengers. However, these measures are considered temporary solutions. The underlying problem is that, statistically, young drivers are not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities that come with driving. Psychology research suggests that even at 18, teens might not be mature enough to drive safely. The risk-taking tendency among teens under 19-20 years old is another concern. By 2010, the Baby Boomer generation's children will be old enough to drive, adding millions of new teen drivers to the roads.\n\nA reasonable solution would involve schools continuing to offer driver's education classes but prohibiting anyone under 18 from driving a vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued before granting a full driver's license, along with a certain number of required driving practice hours. These hours could be based on current state requirements, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Nationwide legislation would be a practical and effective way to protect teen drivers across the country, as the problem affects all states.",
            "Upon perusing the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all the trick films, numbering fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films employ creative editing to create illusions. My analysis primarily focused on detailing the poetics of most trick films and identifying unique characteristics in a few of the later ones. Generally, these films are confined to a set, staged within a frontal proscenium, with no camera movement, using long and medium shots, and adhering to the one-shot-per-film rule. However, a few films from the early 20th century challenge these norms by incorporating elements like multiple shots.\n\nOne common feature among trick films is their indoor setting, framed within a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, not moving to track figures or objects. This style was prevalent in early films and drew inspiration from theatre and vaudeville. One limitation is that figures in trick films usually move side-to-side, without moving towards or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move back and forth horizontally, without the camera following them out of frame.\n\nThis frontal proscenium setup leads to long and, less frequently, medium shots, with close-ups never occurring in any Edison trick film. This technique, like the theatre and vaudeville tradition, allows the audience to see the entire performance at once, framed by the stage borders. Actors do not move towards the camera, so close-ups are absent.\n\nMost early trick films follow the rule that one conceptual shot equates to one film, restricting their length to about a minute or less. This also limits their dramatic or narrative potential, with most focusing on simple vaudeville-style tricks like magic and disappearing acts. However, a single conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes may not correspond to a single physical shot. For instance, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a closer look reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" starts, despite the film being conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor from Caroline was an early and passionate advocate for the Republican cause. Primarily an agriculturalist, his background and brief political career shaped him into a staunch defender of personal liberties and government oversight. His commitment to agrarianism informed his views on governance, including issues of sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judiciary. Taylor believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to establish a perfect system due to the lack of traditional barriers, allowing for self-government. He held that natural rights are interconnected and should be beyond government control to maintain their full value. He contended that in a civilized society, power should not rest with the strongest or most cunning. Taylor advocated for a government that accounts for the inherent goodness and evil in humans, adhering to a dualistic morality. He viewed good principles as those that safeguard property, enhance agriculture, and curb capitalism. He believed that self-interest, while natural in humans, becomes harmful when it leads to societal exploitation. He argued for a limited federal government, with no powers beyond those explicitly stated in the Constitution, to avoid despotism and corruption. He also considered the Declaration of Independence the true foundation of the United States, as it more clearly defines the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "In Figure 17, we noticed a sharp decrease in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. The reason behind this drop is unclear, but it could be attributed to the start of winter in New England, which often leads to fewer people commuting by bicycle or on foot. Additionally, December is typically a busy time for students and faculty, as it marks the end of the fall semester and the holiday season. This could have caused the commuter log to be overlooked. Furthermore, the month-long break for students and faculty due to the holiday season and the resumption of classes in late January might also explain the low number of submissions. It's possible that the project experienced an initial surge in enthusiasm that naturally declined. To counteract this trend, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which led to an increase in log submissions. However, maintaining project momentum was challenging due to both natural decreases in engagement and the impact of holiday and semester breaks. Another obstacle was the cultural preference for driving cars, so offering incentives for alternative commuting modes was crucial. We provided various prizes, such as gift certificates to local businesses and even larger prizes like bicycles or hybrid/electric cars. The value of the prizes could have been increased over time to potentially boost participation even more.",
            "An ETF (exchange-traded fund) is a type of security that was developed to mirror an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund, but it trades more flexibly like a stock on an exchange. ETFs offer the diversification of index funds and the perks of individual stock ownership, such as the ability to short sell, use margin, and buy as few as one share per trade. Despite these advantages, ETFs typically have lower expense ratios than mutual funds. However, they do come with a trade-off: you have to pay a commission for each ETF trade, just like you would for a stock. Additionally, ETFs are known for their wide range of available funds. It's beneficial for investors to assess whether the claimed benefits, such as diversification, actually exist and to what degree. For this analysis, we will examine the IHF ETF and its top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the total assets, to evaluate if owning a single ETF could provide benefits similar to owning a diversified portfolio of the top 10 stocks, and if there are configurations that offer better risk-return ratios. To streamline our analysis, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings. The table below lists these holdings and their respective percentages of total assets.\n\nTo gauge how well these top 10 stocks represent the IHF ETF, we will calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consists of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF's holdings. The calculations for Beta and return are shown in the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, it's clear that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, an increase of 16%. Additionally, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is lower by 0.12 than that of the entire ETF. Based on these results, a portfolio of the top 10 holdings could potentially offer a higher return with a lower risk (Beta). However, statistical differences between the two portfolios remain uncertain.\n\nTo further evaluate the statistical differences between the two portfolios, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation against that of the IHF ETF.",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is one of Edgar Allan Poe's self-proclaimed best poems. In this work, Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott links to Virgil. Virgil used the term to refer to an island north of Britain, seen by the Greeks as the farthest known world. While Virgil indeed used the term, another more recent source may have influenced Poe. Poe was particularly interested in German authors.\n\nThe quote is notable for demonstrating Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writing. Karl J. Arndt, in \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" points out the similarities between Poe's and Goethe's poems, concluding that Poe was likely imitating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned writer of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. In the second part of Faust, there's a short poem called \"The King of Thulé,\" about a king who loses his wife after receiving a goblet from her. Driven by grief to drink, he eventually decides to end his life and throw the goblet into the sea. The king's fate echoes the desolation and grief found in \"Dream-Land.\"\n\nPoe mentions Thule twice in his works, including \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" In \"Dream-Land,\" he uses the term twice as bookends for the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thulé as dark and lonely, haunted by dead friends, and devoid of color—a representation of Poe's own feelings of loss and despair over drinking. The poem reads as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe's world.\n\nGoethe was a significant author whose works Poe would have known, possibly due to his admiration for Tennyson. When asked about Tennyson, Poe expressed his admiration. Additionally, Poe would have been exposed to Goethe's work through various reproductions following the original publications.",
            "According to California law, could a customer injured by falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store win punitive damages by proving the store manager acted maliciously, knowing the spill was dangerous but not addressing it for half an hour to finish his dinner?\n\nA judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages outright. To win such damages, she must show the store manager's actions were deliberate and showed a disregard for the risk of harm, as well as that the actions were particularly egregious. Palmer can argue that the manager should have cleaned the spill promptly to prevent further injuries, given that multiple customers had previously slipped and fallen due to spills. While her argument that the manager's inaction was despicable may not be overwhelmingly convincing, it is still reasonable given that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in the store in 2009, and the manager did not take sufficient action to ensure customer safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee named Rich Wayne informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin responded that he was on his dinner break and couldn't deal with the issue. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also reported the spill to Martin, who responded similarly. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Before Palmer's accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for both compensatory and punitive damages, and we are considering whether to file a summary judgment motion against the punitive damages claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can obtain punitive damages for a non-contractual breach if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that either intended to cause harm or, if there was no such intent, was \"despicable\" and was done with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Id. at § (c)(1). Courts have deemed conduct malicious when the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of their actions and willfully failed to avoid them. Taylor v. Super.

            "Around four years ago, I took an Islam class at CBC. Our class frequently debated whether Islam is a hostile religion, and that question seems more pertinent now than ever. Reflecting on events since 9/11, I've noticed a shift in the U.S. media's portrayal of Islam and extremists, from hostility to extreme tolerance. In 2001, it's unlikely we would have seen a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with an evident Muslim background in his family. The Prophet Muhammad's biography intrigues me because it seems to conflict with the historical accounts of his personality. Traditionally, I believed Muhammad forced converts to Islam through conquest, but the biography portrays him as a humble prophet misunderstood by others, who one by one came to acknowledge his teachings. The similarities between Jesus' ministry and Muhammad's miracles, such as multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men, suggest the writers aimed to depict Muhammad as a prophet who didn't need to prove his credentials but simply lived his truth. This approach, I argue, diminishes Jesus' life and miracles. Moreover, many stories in the biography seem to aim to provide 'witnesses' or personal conversions to Islam, often based on hearsay. These accounts, with their third-party perspectives, feel less credible and more suspicious to me. Lastly, I find the biography's portrayal of Muhammad as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle man misleading, as historical records show otherwise. I wonder if modern Muslims are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "After Jesus' passing, his teachings and beliefs were quickly overshadowed in the evolution of Christian thought. Over time, Christianity diverged increasingly from its original roots. Present-day society exhibits a heightened awareness and progressive tendencies, though traditionalists may linger and oppose new ideas. Christian historians will likely deepen their understanding of the faith, seeking to distinguish later additions from Jesus' original intentions. Eventually, a strong movement will emerge to strip away these additions, reverting Christianity to its initial form. As this trend spreads in the United States and Europe, masses may return to worshipping as they did during Jesus' time, guided by his ideas alone. Although this could lead to increased uniformity within Christianity, the institutional church will remain strong. Throughout history, we've seen reversals, such as when Christianity went from being persecuted by the Roman Empire to becoming its dominant religion. The impending reversion in Christianity will follow this pattern, simplifying the faith and reducing its diversity. This transformation will be aided by interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically rather than literally. Looking back through history, Judaism was the precursor to Christianity, centered around monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures before the Romans controlled Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. Jews were diverse, categorized into groups like Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, and Zealots, along with a majority of common people.",
            "I contend that \"The Jungle\" by Upton Sinclair illustrates the inherent greed and self-interest of human nature. Individuals prioritize their own well-being and success, disregarding those beneath them. This theme is evident in the factory owners and managers, whose sole aim is to expand their empires, without regard for the harm caused by their actions. Sinclair's description of the factories \"a line of buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky, with great chimneys pouring out rivers of smoke\" underscores the environmental damage they inflict. The owners' apathy towards the suffering of people and animals, whether from pollution or harsh working conditions, is apparent. They prioritize profits over worker safety, as seen in their exploitative labor practices and absence of compensation for layoffs. Laws and regulations during that time offered little protection, allowing managers and owners to exploit their employees in substandard conditions. Workers were essentially trapped in this system, with no recourse or assistance, and were often forced to work to the point of death. Unions, while formed to help, often compounded the workers' misery by enriching themselves. Sinclair's comparison of workers to slaves highlights their desperate plight, unable to escape the brutal system that left them \"hanging always on the verge of starvation, dependent for opportunities of life upon the whim of men as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers\"",
            "Many authors employ various methods to evoke specific emotions or perspectives in their readers. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his novel \"The Great Gatsby,\" employs a number of these techniques with varying degrees of effectiveness. One approach he uses is to pair adjectives and nouns in unusual combinations to create a particular atmosphere. Additionally, he assigns symbolic significance to colors and reuses these symbols to reinforce his narrative. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald attributes specific meanings to colors like white/gray and red/pink, which he then employs to evoke particular sensations around key subjects.\n\nFitzgerald's association of white/gray with uniformity is evident in his use of these colors throughout the novel. White is often associated with higher social status and elegance, while gray signifies age and faded appearances. This is first established at the novel's outset with frequent mentions of white and gray. Characters such as Daisy and Jordan are consistently described as \"in white,\" and even minor characters like Nick, Tom, and Catherine are depicted in white attire. Furthermore, Fitzgerald employs these colors to describe mundane subjects, enhancing their significance. For instance, Nick travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York,\" and the names of partygoers are \"gray names.\" Even simple objects and settings, like apartment houses and cars, are described in terms of white and gray, reinforcing their symbolism.\n\nAfter establishing the meanings of white/gray, Fitzgerald uses them to convey a sense of uniformity or insignificance. This technique begins with Daisy, who is first described as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster.\" This use of white diminishes her character status, making her seem more like a uniform addition, an object of Gatsby's desire. Fitzgerald continues to use this technique with Daisy, such as describing her \"gray haze of fur collar\" and her outfit as \"white\" before her encounter with Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County is exceptionally fertile due to its mild and sunny climate. Common crops include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits such as peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a strong demand for organic community supported agriculture (CSA) in the San Diego region, with many local organizations boasting long waiting lists for their services. Organic eggs and milk are also popular purchases. Many organic farms offer tours of their operations and access to recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching. This setup allows landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitat, promoting recreational use, and creating opportunities for farm tours and educational programs.\n\nOrganic farming typically offers greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemicals. However, it can be more labor-intensive and costly than conventional farming, as it requires intensive management to control pests and weeds and maintain soil fertility without chemicals. Additionally, organic farms may experience higher losses and lack the economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations. Certain practices beneficial to wildlife, like planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, and invasive species removal, also require more labor. Therefore, landowners in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expertise to balance profit and habitat quality.\n\nThe land in question is a 160-acre parcel near Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. This land includes chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, and is part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion in the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan currently recognizes over a hundred species of plants and animals, with many being endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, and others are declining and may soon be listed as endangered, like burrowing owls.\n\nThis land has a rich history of habitation by Native Americans for centuries and was later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. It was part of an original homestead and likely used for grazing and wood production for many years. After researching available government programs, a model organic farm in the same area was identified as a potential example of what could be achieved with this land.",
            "Culture is a crucial factor in any negotiation. It can be understood as much by its absence as by its presence and significance. Culture is not uniform or isolated. Blanket statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are too simplistic. While it's helpful to grasp the general traits of a culture, a skilled negotiator should focus on how the culture's attitudes affect the negotiation process. When encountering a foreign culture, it's natural to relate it to one's own culture, leading to inevitable comparisons. Understanding a foreign culture or mindset may involve delving into its history, understanding its biases, and accepting it for what it is, rather than trying to change it. This is especially important if you're in a weaker bargaining position or in \"away\" territory. Cultural nuances extend beyond national borders, as individual companies often have their own distinct cultures, influencing factors like work hours, communication styles, and hiring practices. Some companies may encourage or restrict employee philanthropy. Even cultures that appear uniform can have deep layers. Understanding a culture's values, which provide its \"why,\" is equally important. For instance, if a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator will refrain from public humiliation. Similarly, a negotiator from a culture that values aggressive bargaining will not relent easily. Before negotiation, it's beneficial to learn about one's opponent's personal background to enhance the process.",
            "The statement \"There is no God\" was supposedly made by a fool, as written in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is the starting point for St. Anselm's argument about God's existence. This belief is shared by another author we'll discuss, Thomas Aquinas. Since both are defending the same idea, and we're to compare their arguments, we'll assume they both believe in the Bible's God for simplicity's sake. Assuming any other god wouldn't allow a fair comparison, as their arguments are specific to this concept. However, both arguments fall short of providing a comprehensive basis for believing in God. To illustrate this, let's first look at St. Anselm's main argument. He proposes that we find truth about God within our own understanding. He argues that because we can't imagine God's non-existence, we can thereby prove his existence. This idea, though complex, suggests that the proof for God lies within our own minds, not requiring external evidence. This is often referred to as faith in Christian texts. In contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas advocates for proving God's existence through reason and empirical evidence alone, without needing faith. His five logical arguments, including change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony, suggest that God's existence can be deduced from logic.",
            "Around the 5th or 6th century BCE, a future Buddha was born. He left the worldly life, achieved enlightenment, and his teachings eventually led to the formation of Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being the most traditional branch. This religion is now about 2500 years old and has evolved significantly since Buddha's time, evident in practices like the annual water-cutting ceremony in Sri Lanka, where monks and laypeople participate despite Buddha not teaching such rituals. These changes span from superficial traditions to the religion's core beliefs. Theravada Buddhism, both from the monastic and lay perspectives, has had to adapt its doctrines over time due to both external and internal influences, both friendly and hostile.\n\nThroughout this discussion, several terms will be used. Internal forces are those originating from within the Buddhist community, while external forces come from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces harm or intend to harm Buddhism, while benign forces do not wish to harm the community but may inadvertently do so. These terms will be frequently used.\n\nFirst, let's explore the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists find refuge in the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma includes the Tripitaka, three collections of texts: the Sutta Pitaka (containing Suttas), the Vinaya Pitaka (disciplinary rules), and the Abhidhamma Pitaka (metaphysical concepts like Anatta, Dukkha, and Anicca). Understanding these concepts helps one break the cycle of Sansara (death and rebirth), along with its components: lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). When one becomes enlightened, these cease. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for laypeople (five precepts) and monks (many more). Fundamental to Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome, and there is a way to achieve this.",
            "America and Mexico once had a long-standing rivalry that lasted from 1836 to 1893, with the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848 serving as the peak of their conflict. Other disputes also occurred between the two nations, with the rivalry subsiding just before World War I. The animosity began due to disagreements over religion, culture, and economic interests, not unlike many border-sharing nations. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that only Mexico and Cuba posed long-term challenges to U.S. diplomacy due to their proximity and rivalry. Religious tensions, rooted in historic distrust between the English and Spanish, were a significant obstacle to friendly relations. Diehl and Goerts (2000) enumerate 17 disputes, mainly involving territorial issues caused by raids and outlaw activities across the border. Schmitt (1974) attributes the easing of the rivalry to Mexico's growing dependence on the U.S. and the shift in American aims from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was unexpectedly struck by a previously unknown illness that left me disabled. At the time, I was a nurse, having chosen this career to ensure safety and security, driven by my childhood experiences and the reassuring mantra that \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" Even though my dream was to become a scientist or journalist, I chose nursing. Yet, here I am, at 46 years old, single, and unable to work. After 15 years on Social Security Disability, I have nothing to call my own, and daily struggles assault my sense of security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, but I know that without the support of my family and some good friends, I wouldn't have lasted this long. When disaster truly strikes, you feel incredibly weak, no matter how strong you are.\n\nMy point is that life throws emergencies at us, big and small, and no matter how well we prepare, some challenges are too great to face alone. While I agree that Americans should not rely solely on big government, I believe we should instead focus on rebuilding trust and mutual support. The Conservatives in the U.S. praise \"rugged individualism\" as the foundation of our country, but our forefathers' resilience came from compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources. Pioneers didn't cross the Rockies alone in wagon trains.\n\nTherefore, while I advocate for preparation, I also urge you to connect with your neighbors and form a support network. I have a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and other essentials. If you have the ability and resources, consider starting a small farm and preserving your own food, or even having a wood stove, but always remember that building a strong community is equally important.",
            "Why do organisms change over time? What factors influence the direction of their evolution? While in 1917 D'Arcy Thompson remarked that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" this sentiment still holds true today. Recently, mathematical modeling has been used to study general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis across both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research aims to explore how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help understand the mechanisms behind the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental changes. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters, which were then used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies with the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). These models, along with experimental and descriptive studies, help us better grasp macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a structure that moves through 360 degrees of space over time. These loops or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis called the columella. The rate at which whorls enlarge can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl, known as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last, called the body whorl. The spire consists of all whorls except the last, with the apex being the tip and the base the opposite end. The aperture is the opening through which the animal extends out of its shell.\n\nShells can be viewed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The \"usual\" orientation is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves first viewing the shell from the apical perspective and determining where the first suture begins. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell into two parts, from which whorls are counted and estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that traverse through time and space as the animal grows its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced using the coordinates of the centers of each whorl's aperture, as well as the horizontal and vertical radii of the aperture. This trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is established, parameters can be varied and modified to alter the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have remained relatively unchanged over the past decade. While the nation is progressing towards several Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, the progress in child and maternal health lags behind what's needed to meet the 2015 goals. This disparity is due to several factors, suggesting that it's crucial to bolster the overall healthcare system rather than focusing solely on specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% now meeting this criterion. However, these skilled workers often include traditional midwives who are unable to handle medical interventions, leading to higher maternal mortality due to complications like hemorrhage. This improvement is somewhat misleading, as there's still significant work to be done. Additionally, the percentage of children under five receiving professional treatment for diarrhea has decreased, and there are concerns about postnatal care, as data is incomplete but shows low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean section rates remain low at 4%, with a notable disparity between urban (7%) and rural (2%) settings. This highlights an issue of healthcare access, with most services concentrated in urban areas. Further, there's a significant gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles (27%), indicating that the poor face greater barriers in accessing healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering strategies to enhance neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is which approach is most effective in addressing the lack of services. Should Indonesia prioritize program-specific interventions or strengthen the overall healthcare system without targeting pre- and postnatal care for mothers and children? While programmatic approaches offer targeted, manageable goals and faster results, they also have drawbacks. Heavy investment in specific areas can lead to funding shortages and human resource imbalances, potentially causing program duplication and increased paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "Victorian novels are distinguished by their meticulous attention to detail and focus on the aristocracy of the era. Two exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, unlike other novels of the time, which enhances the characters' development. These novels often employ dream sequences or dreamlike states to convey mystery, which serves different purposes in each case.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, these dreamlike sequences provide insights into Oliver's inner turmoil, revealing his emotional and psychological state, as well as his awareness of the true nature of events around him. For instance, when he relives the shooting in Chapter 28, it feels like a dream, highlighting Oliver’s lack of control over his fate and the desperate state of his health. The passage emphasizes his inability to regain control of the situation, as he doesn’t notice the unseen force that takes him away, and he experiences constant, fear-driven pain. This event suggests that Oliver has little agency over his life and that his despair is growing, potentially due to the influence of Fagin. It implies that if Oliver had any capacity to react, he would have tried to save himself, but he is overwhelmed and defeated.\n\nThe day passed – the day seemed to pass – and night fell again; night that was long and silent, yet brief, like a fleeting dream.",
            "A few years ago, I worked in an after-school tutoring program for elementary students. While I assisted them in various subjects, my proficiency was greatest in English and reading. A colleague asked me to help a boy named Adrian, who was having significant difficulty with reading. I soon realized that Adrian understood some letters perfectly but struggled with others, which seemed unusual. Adrian was of Latino descent and spoke fluent English, which made his situation puzzling. We faced challenges until I met Adrian's mother. During a field trip, she arrived to pick him up, and I realized she spoke only Spanish. With my limited Spanish, we managed to communicate, and I discovered that Adrian could read but was unfamiliar with the English alphabet. I don't know if this insight helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nThis story highlights the complex issue of language barriers in schools, particularly in California. Even a child who speaks perfect English might struggle with reading due to unfamiliarity with the English alphabet. This problem is evident, and while solutions exist, they are not straightforward. For children like Adrian, who spoke fluent English but needed help with the alphabet, tutoring was effective. For those who speak little to no English, the challenge is more complex.\n\nThe dual language system could be beneficial. While it's often feared to be resource-intensive and ineffective for most students, research shows that children in these programs outperform their peers. However, implementing it as a standard practice rather than an exception would benefit all students. Special bilingual aides or tutors can help, but requiring all teachers to be bilingual isn't practical. Combining different approaches, such as dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes, is key to addressing this issue.",
            "From a young age, many of us are taught about something beyond our comprehension, often through religious instruction or personal introspection.

We sat on our porch, listening to the rain as we shared cigarettes. The gutters overflowed, drenching the plants along the edge. He gazed into the rain, his eyes reflecting a mix of searching and reminiscing. He appeared thinner, his hair less dense than before. I was overwhelmed by his condition and struggled to discuss how much I'd miss him. Instead, I hugged him and sat closer, joining him in watching the rain.\n\nMy father passed away in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday.

            "The \"Gothic Novel\" is, in essence and name, an \"old-new\" oxymoron, as Ian Watt describes in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been both criticized and praised, accused of lacking depth and celebrated for its 'terrible sublime' quality (Burke). The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, combined the ideas of ancient and modern romances to create the proto-Gothic genre and a new mode of literary expression. Walpole employed old theatrical elements and modern mimicking of nature in contemporary novels to present what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre continues to draw upon medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, despite the term \"gothic\" originally being used to describe various peoples, styles, and time periods. Initially seen as archaic or unsophisticated against \"modern\" societal and literary advancements, the blend of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the novel format that allowed readers a deeper look into characters' psychology has enabled Gothic literature to endure and remain both obsolete and fresh to readers from different time periods.\n\nOne key idea present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, training a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is significant to Gothic writers because it embodies the ideal of a brave, honorable, and competent knight, and the perceived or supposed lack of such qualities in contemporary society. By employing chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, hinting at Gothic's evolution towards Romanticism, and used to strive for improvement in the present. Writing during a politically turbulent time and possibly despondent over the future, Walpole may have felt that the morality and inherent goodness present in the gothic era had been lost in contemporary society. This perspective is evident in several characters, such as Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits. Before meeting Frederic, he is described as a:\n\nThe description of him includes traditional chivalric elements: Frederic is a prince, has suffered tragedies, and is presumed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, introducing the soon-to-be typical Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves the series of steps that take an order from a customer back through the stages of raw materials, production, and distribution, delivering the product to the customer. The term was coined by Keith Oliver in 1982 as a way to describe the planning, execution, and control of the supply chain to meet customer needs efficiently. Six key components make up a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these components to enhance customer service. Production, the first step, forms the basis for the entire supply chain. It involves deciding what, when, where, and how to produce goods based on customer demand, which is typically determined by market analysis. Managers must consider market conditions and customer preferences to decide on the products to produce and their quantities. They also need to choose the optimal location for production, balancing volume, quality, and cost. After setting the production location, managers focus on scheduling and equipment maintenance. This step is crucial as every detail impacts the overall process. For instance, retail giants like Wal-Mart and Target have detailed processes and procedures for every aspect of their operations, reducing confusion and ensuring smooth workflow. Supply, the second key element, involves making strategic decisions about facility capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Companies may have multiple divisions for a single product, each with unique equipment, workers, and expertise. Managers must select the best division for each product process. Outsourcing can help achieve velocity, the ability to provide quality and flexibility while controlling costs.",
            "Hitler exists in Burma, according to the sign.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone at a street corner with a cardboard sign above her head, bearing a disturbing message written in Sharpie. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation controlled by an oppressive military regime that took power through a coup d'état in 1962. In 2007, public protests led by Buddhist monks, dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution,\" occurred following a decade of silence. Initially, the Burmese government tolerated the monks' peaceful demonstrations, but it soon escalated into a violent conflict with the military. Foreign journalists were detained and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed on September 27th, 2007, for covering the protests. The official death toll stands at 13, but Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army, claimed thousands had been killed.\n\nThis is not a new phenomenon. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over their citizens. Early Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, Japanese emperors were believed to be gods, and U.S. President George W. Bush supposedly had weekly meetings with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a Conservative Party affiliate.\n\nFamous examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students protested the government's authoritarian rule, with official reports ranging from 200-3,000 dead. The Rwandan genocide in the 1990s saw Hutu militia groups, backed by the Rwandan government, systematically kill Tutsis and political moderates. Hitler's Third Reich, a period spanning several years and countries, resulted in widespread persecution and murder of Jews.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence in jazz is largely due to his longevity and his ability to guide his orchestra. Although his piano playing is often subtle, Ellington excelled as a composer, crafting intricate pieces that highlighted the unique talents of his band members. He created a framework that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also writing pieces that showcased the specific styles of his players. This approach not only emphasized the tone of the orchestra as a whole but also resulted in some of the most innovative and brilliant jazz compositions of all time.\n\nThe Grove Music Dictionary highlights Ellington's sound and innovation by referencing \"Creole Love Call.\" This piece, which uses the voice as a jazz instrument, demonstrates Ellington’s early use of vocal texture and color without lyrics. The piece, a slow twelve-bar blues with six choruses, showcases several soloists, including a muted trumpet, clarinet, and his voice itself. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded the following year, Ellington's orchestration and ear for tone color are evident in a call and response between a muted trumpet and scat singing. The song \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further exemplifies this, with Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton using his muted trombone to introduce the melody.",
            "She had always felt a void, a longing that remained unfulfilled. This feeling began when she was 14, entering her teenage years, and persisted at 17, even though she had decided she wanted someone rather than an object.

So, she lived her life, always curious about her desires.\n\nAt home, life was usually serene.

The hospital's antiseptic scent filled the air, but her mind was focused solely on helping her mother.\n\nHer mother had lost her balance while climbing a step stool to reach a high cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that sticking closely to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), measured by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", correlates with a reduced likelihood of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related deaths. The aMed diet is a variant of the Med diet that emphasizes higher consumption of plant-based foods (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (over saturated fats), and fish, while limiting intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious observational studies have shown an inverse relationship between adherence to the Med diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial also found that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in overweight individuals. Prior studies did not specifically focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 years, who were part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. Over six periods from 1984 to 2004, researchers calculated an aMed diet score using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) to assess nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of nurses maintained their involvement throughout the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. Where documentation was unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better capture long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (by averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for potential confounding factors (variables that could skew results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a severe financial crisis, characterized by rising unemployment, a collapsed housing market, and the demise of many prominent financial institutions. This economic downturn continues today, prompting the question: what caused this crisis, and how can we prevent future occurrences? The crisis was largely a result of shortsighted and self-interested political decisions that compelled banks and corporations to issue sub-prime loans within an inadequately developed financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to back and repack these mortgages into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and credit default swaps (CDS). When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves, which led them to transfer the resulting turmoil onto the repackaged mortgages and into the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of the financial crisis were planted during the Clinton administration in 1999, as the president sought a second term. To boost his popularity, he loosened lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime mortgage crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times warned at the time, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's leading home mortgage underwriter, faced pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage lending to low and moderate-income individuals, and faced pressure from shareholders to maintain its remarkable profit growth.\" Holmes accurately predicted the consequences, stating, \"The government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, requiring a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As the introduction mentions, and Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending led to the economic collapse.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the complex structures of mortgages. The widespread use of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) in the years leading up to the crisis further interwove different sectors of the economy with the housing market. This increased leverage made U.S. households and financial markets highly sensitive to even minor price fluctuations. When the housing bubble burst, financial institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities suffered significant losses. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for around 30% of the USA’s GDP. Ultimately, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dissolved, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become heavily regulated commercial banks. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Exposition: The section of your narrative where you spread your wings and captivate your audience with your enthralling prose, or where you risk losing your readers' attention. Dr. Merlin has had her share of frustration while dealing with this part, often finding herself amidst a flurry of unnecessary details. Despite the well-known advice to \"show, not tell,\" many writers, including Dr. Merlin, still struggle with exposition, often giving too much background information too quickly.\n\nExposition is the part where you simply inform the audience about past events, often in straightforward language. In movies, it's when one character shares a long monologue of information, like \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, this is done by the author.\n\nConsider this example: While reading a story, you're told that the main character met her love, got married, and then lost him. You wouldn't expect this entire backstory to take up two pages with limited dialogue. Instead, you'd expect the author to flesh out the husband's character, showing his love for his wife through his words and actions. The same goes for the heroine, where her character should be evident through her interactions with him. This way, you'd feel the emotional impact of his death and connect with the heroine's experience more deeply.\n\nIn essence, you need to add substance to the bare facts of the story. Sometimes, the urge to rush through certain details is strong. Perhaps you're introducing a new character who was once in the Air Force, now runs a gas station, has been married twice, likes fishing, dreams of owning the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast. Instead of just stating these facts, incorporate them into the character's actions and dialogue.",
            "I tuned in to two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first live broadcast was from NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story reported a man named Shad Hostettler who stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. They aired his mug shot, and he appeared to have a menacing appearance. The story was given minimal coverage, dedicating only about two minutes to it. The details were scant, mentioning only that he had stabbed her multiple times and was arrested. I think the time spent was appropriate.\n\nThe second story was about a young man named Travis Buyers, 18, who had been critically injured in a shooting in the Sharon Woods area. There were no arrests or suspects at the time, and the SWAT team was investigating. This story seemed rushed, and I believe this could be due to it involving a minority individual. I've often noticed that crimes against minorities are less frequently reported or receive less attention. On the other hand, crimes against whites, especially children, are often heavily covered by the media.\n\nThe next story discussed a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given on the incident's location, and it was determined to be a .22 caliber rifle bullet. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThe following story warned about rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They mentioned temperatures would be in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The report was brief but served as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nAnother story covered a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man, about six feet tall and weighing 150 pounds, dressed in a hoodie sweatshirt. The story seemed to emphasize his race and skin color more than necessary.\n\nThe final story discussed Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin sentenced for distributing marijuana in large quantities from Texas to Ohio. Instead of saying 25 years, they mentioned 300 months. It's unclear why they used this phrasing, possibly to make it sound more severe. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, which seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "The bond between brothers is profound and unshakable, encompassing a range of emotions such as love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers possess a deep understanding of each other, often seeing themselves reflected in their siblings. This intimate bond is most evident in dire situations, where both positive and negative emotions can be exposed. Understanding the complexities of this fraternal bond involves acknowledging the consequences that come with it. By looking into a brother's eyes, one sees not how they are perceived by others, but their true self. Their character is revealed through their actions and the consequences of those actions. In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers delve into this theme, facing the turmoil of their emotions in a vividly described landscape. A climax of bitterness and intense pride leads to one brother's demise. The story explores this theme through the protagonist's, Doodle's, direct characterization and their interactions, as well as the narrator's perspective, which conveys the protagonist's feelings and his worldview, significantly influencing his actions. The protagonist's motivations can be distilled to a single emotion: pride. Starting from their first outing together to their final, fateful trip, he harbors resentment towards Doodle. He longed for a brother who could learn and participate in various activities like holding his breath, running, or climbing trees, but Doodle's heart condition made this impossible. The protagonist initially feels anger towards Doodle, even considering harming him at one point, yet a simple smile from Doodle melts his heart, revealing his underlying love and weaker resolve.",
            "The human brain is an intricate, innovative information-processing system. As technology evolved from primitive to advanced, so did the metaphors used to represent the brain. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, followed by a book, and most recently, a computer. As you delve into understanding the brain, keep in mind the limited usefulness of these metaphors and their potential to lead to incorrect conclusions.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory organs converting physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or light into electrochemical signals. This sensory information is repeatedly transformed through the brain's algorithms in both bottom-up and top-down processes. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing compiles simple data like color, orientation, and border changes to identify the box. Top-down processing utilizes decisions from these bottom-up processes to accelerate recognition of the box. In this example, top-down processing might help you classify the object as a black box rather than a hole.\n\nOnce information is processed, an attention filter determines its importance and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. Conversely, you might pick out your name even in a noisy room. The processing of information involves multiple stages, with results repeatedly modulated by attention.\n\nTo process information, the brain must first store it. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Information is initially encoded based on its type of sensory input. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally (how the word looks), phonemically (how it sounds), or semantically (what it means). Once stored, information must be maintained. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which holds information for about 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons for a short duration. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are numerous theories on how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on human memory retrieval, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that knowledge is organized into nodes representing concepts, with nodes linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the impending threat of technology and capitalism through his dystopian novel, Brave New World. The societal structure prioritizes community over individuality and promotes immediate happiness, conditioning citizens from birth. People are pawns in a larger system dictated by the World Controller. Examining the novel through Marxist lenses reveals Huxley's concerns about these developments. The novel employs Marxist terms like homogenization and reification to highlight issues with the emerging capitalistic economy. Capitalism is satirized through the concept of false consciousness, where the common people are kept unaware of their true economic relations and focused solely on personal gain. This is achieved through ideological control, evident in the conditioning of people in Brave New World. Lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, have no autonomy, with hypnopædia reinforcing their desires to consume. Hegemony, where a group dominates another, is also present in the World State. The lower classes are unaware of this manipulation, 'buying into' the ideology that supports capitalism. Upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, are aware but accept their position. The novel's lack of meaningful relationships between characters and the superficiality of interactions reflect the loss of free will and expression. Love and strong emotions are absent, as are meaningful interactions; men discuss women's physical appearance, and women discuss their encounters. Each class's acceptance of their status in the hierarchy illustrates the socioeconomic impact of capitalism, with people believing they are superior due to their consumption and obedience.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for roughly 2.5 years, which equates to about 4.5 semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many students, including myself. During my freshman year, I was assigned a dorm room in East Halls, the farthest eastward point on campus (excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center). Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in locations like the Willard building, situated near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes, especially in bad weather, which is common in State College. An alumnus, not much older than me, shared that in the past, the East Halls dorms were secluded by large tracts of empty land. Today, that space is occupied by sports fields, new buildings such as the new Creamery and health services building, and apartments, as the campus continues to expand, making it increasingly difficult to move from one place to another. The most effective solution for this mobility issue is cycling, but simply having bikes isn't enough. Students need to use them, and the campus must be designed to accommodate cyclists. My friend who recently resumed cycling after a few years mentioned that he couldn't understand why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “they’re the only viable way to get around.” Cycling is not only efficient but also beneficial for one's health. A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of physical exertion can cover 30 miles or more. Like many students, I now reside off campus, just as far from the center as some dorms. The best decision I made this year was to buy a bike. My daily class in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my home, can be reduced to 5 minutes by cycling. The main problem is that Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, isn't always easy to navigate on a bike. Although walking also has its merits, I don't have the time. Without a bike, walking would be my only dependable option for getting to class. Daily walks to Thomas would consume an extra 30-40 minutes, totaling around 2.5 hours a week. Adding the time spent walking to and from other classes, appointments, and so forth, that's more time than I can afford to spare."
