            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "This paper examines the Biological and Sociocultural models in the context of insomnia. The Biological model explores the genetic and medical components of sleep disorders, while the Sociocultural model examines the environmental influences, such as race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia discusses these models and interprets the research selected to explain them. It also evaluates the research findings, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be categorized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder linked to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while those related to mental disorders are linked to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical issues or substance intake. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia is characterized by difficulty in obtaining or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is a problem with staying awake. Narcolepsy involves sudden loss of muscle tone (cataplexy) and/or automatic behaviors during REM sleep. Dyssomnias deal with sleep initiation and maintenance, whereas Parasomnias are characterized by behavioral and physiological abnormalities during sleep, including Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The review primarily focuses on insomnia and primary sleep disorders, in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders centers on genetics, inherited factors, and physiological aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that the GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons control sleep/wake cycles. When activated, GABAA receptors promote sleep, but if inhibited, they can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep time in mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). This suggests that the findings in mice can be extrapolated to humans, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor. Disruptions in this receptor could impair sleep quality without medication. Socioculturally, if the receptor phenotype is inherited, it could influence sleep, and any alteration could negatively affect daily life, including school, career, and tasks requiring focus.",
            "This paper explores three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with a brief explanation of what CAPD is. Next, it outlines the diagnosis process, including common signs or \"red flags\". Finally, it offers strategies for teachers in mainstream classrooms to support students with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is a condition that affects how efficiently and effectively the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. Essentially, it's a disorder where the brain struggles to process sounds correctly, even though the person can hear normally. This is because the brain area responsible for interpreting and distinguishing between sounds and conversations does not function as it should.\n\nThe concept of CAPD can be traced back to the mid-1950s, initially referred to as \"auditory imperception\" by researchers studying children with communication disorders. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started developing tests for these children in 1954. In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the neurobiology behind dichotic perception. The disorder gained more attention in 1977 following a national conference that stimulated further research.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways: a person might struggle to locate or hear sounds in space, distinguish between multiple sounds, recognize sound patterns, detect changes in speech like sarcasm, be unable to filter out one sound from another, or struggle to understand the sequence of auditory information.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD typically involves systematic observation of listening behaviors and performance on auditory function tests, which can be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists (SLPs), psychologists, and others. These tests may include questionnaires, observations of auditory behaviors, and more advanced tests that record acoustic signals within the ear. There's currently no single, consistent diagnostic tool or known cause for CAPD.",
            "\"Twelfth Night suggests that while disguise can be a powerful tool for long-term deception, ultimately, one must shed that false identity to avoid losing their true self. However, ending a deception can lead to isolation since one may find themselves alienated. This dilemma requires choosing between preserving oneself or maintaining relationships. While some may respond calmly to the revelation, others may be offended by the deception. The theme of deception in gender role reversal is particularly complex, as it raises questions about why an individual would alter their identity. In Viola's case, the deception is a means of self-preservation: 'I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…' (5.1.247-249) Arriving in an unfamiliar land, Viola feels compelled to disguise herself as a man to protect herself from potential attackers. Her ruse succeeds, but it also isolates her from women, depriving her of necessary support. Moreover, her convincing performance as a man leads Olivia to mistake her for Sebastian and fall in love: 'Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.' (5.1.138) Additionally, Viola must grapple with suppressed romantic feelings towards Orsino: 'Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.' (5.1.260-261) This, although progressive by Renaissance standards, may seem to modern readers as an exploration of how deception can reveal hidden emotions, particularly for Olivia and Orsino. The play hints that these characters might have unacknowledged desires forced into the open by Viola's deception. For instance, does Olivia's affection for Cesario stem from Cesario's male appearance, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? It's likely not the latter, as Olivia seems to judge people based on appearances, as seen in her swift change of affection from Cesario to Sebastian and her view of Cesario/Viola as a sister rather than a love interest: 'A sister, you are she.'

            "German colonial rule has been widely recognized for its harshness, particularly in connection with the genocide against the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, it would be inaccurate to attribute the entire empire to such a simple characterization; it varied greatly in policies and governance, as well as in educational provision. For instance, in German East Africa (Tanganyika), a substantial number of educated and literate Africans existed by 1919 due to the British finding a well-established educational system. Similarly, educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were commended by contemporary authors. The scenario in South West Africa (now Namibia) was notably different. Unlike East Africa, where the government played a significant role in educating natives via state schools, the responsibility for native education in South West Africa was largely left to missionary societies, receiving minimal government support. The colonial government, however, invested heavily in the education of Europeans, setting up state schools and supporting missionary schools. These educational policies has lasting impacts on South West Africa, even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies boasted many literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa \"the vast majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate.\" Several social, political, and economic factors contributed to this stark contrast. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors and focus on new research regarding the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities toward native Africans.\n\nThere is a considerable amount of scholarly work on education within the German colonial empire, with many sources available in German and written during or shortly after the colonial period. Early works primarily aimed to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later English-language works expanded on this by comparing education across different German colonies and conducting more in-depth analyses. These studies highlighted significant variations in educational systems among German colonies. Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa is particularly relevant to this topic. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that contributed to their differences. According to Cohen, the sizeable settler population in South West Africa explains many of its unique educational system characteristics.\n\nCompared to other German colonial territories, South West Africa had a relatively mild climate, although much of the land is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected these more favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, significantly more than the approximately 5,336 Europeans in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has expanded significantly over the past 100 years, encompassing numerous genres that are difficult to list entirely. This is further complicated by the fact that most genres, such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have given birth to multiple sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. Interestingly, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has emerged as one of the most varied and expressive forms of popular music over the past 40 years. Its expressiveness stems from its wide range of emotions, which often lean towards darker themes. The genre's diversity is evident in its ability to adapt and evolve, leading to the creation of various sub-genres and further divisions, a trend that continues today.\n\nCurrent heavy metal music has developed into a complex landscape with numerous sub-niches, making it challenging to define what constitutes heavy metal. It has absorbed themes from other genres but, like any movement, has its roots in a specific origin. To comprehend today's metal music, one must first understand the essence of the metal movement and why it transcends a simple genre classification.\n\nMetal is often described as a movement characterized by darkness, embodying a \"more\" approach—more bass, volume, violence, and theatricality, while also showcasing musicianship and skill. It is also marked by a culture of drug use, particularly during the psychedelic drug boom of the mid-70s, which inspired musicians to create intense, otherworldly music. The movement draws heavily from the dark, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era, as seen in songs like \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles, which is considered one of the first heavy metal tracks. The lyrics reflect the darker side of the movement:",
            "A few decades prior to the Surrealists' dreamlike paintings, Henri Rousseau was already crafting his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. The Dream, a 1910 artwork by the renowned Post-Impressionist, showcases a woman in awe of the wonders in her dream, as well as Rousseau’s personal aspirations and internal conflicts as an artist. Throughout his career, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and praise from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, but grappled with the choice between conforming to established styles or maintaining his unique artistic identity. The Dream encapsulates this lifelong internal struggle: to either imitate existing styles or forge his own path. To comprehend The Dream from this perspective, one should first acquaint oneself with Rousseau's biography. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, his father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle. Without formal art training, Rousseau worked as a gabelou, a municipal toll service employee, until the age of forty, earning the nickname douanier. After losing his first wife and eight infant children, he found solace in painting, using it as a new beginning. Unlike his contemporaries who idealized and romanticized the peasant in their art, Rousseau was a folk painter, reflecting the hopes and dreams of the common people. His desire for acceptance in the art world is understandable, as he lacked formal education and started his career late, working alongside more talented and recognized artists like Matisse. As Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters, while both artists were competitors, their motivations differed: Matisse was driven by a fear of painting trite subjects, while Rousseau sought to paint conventionally to gain acceptance from the Artiste Français.",
            "Numerous influential thinkers have proposed a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, as well as truth and beauty. I argue that this connection has a fundamental basis. As John Keats asserts in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- / That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of our knowledge comes from education or experience, we often appreciate ethics and aesthetics without formal instruction. Both fields aim to explain rather than dictate; studying morality or beauty seeks to understand why something is good art or moral, rather than providing rules for judgment or creation. Critiques of art or morality rarely capture the essence of what is good or beautiful. For instance, discussions about the Mona Lisa may focus on elements like contrast or context, yet they don't pinpoint why it is great art. When asked about favorite works, people often say, \"There's just something about it,\" indicating a deeper, indescribable quality. Both art and morality possess this transcendental nature, as Flannery O'Connor maintains, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...\". This je ne sais quoi is a potent attribute of art and morality, bridging the gap between them. I believe that our experience of morality and art is profoundly emotional, or \"noumenal\" in Kantian terms, impacting us deeply yet defying comprehensive explanation, especially in literature. As McKean says, \"Literature's moral quality is what sets it apart, making it unique among the arts. While moral standards may not apply to all arts, they're as relevant to literature as they are to life itself.\"",
            "Today's Germany is considered a powerful, unified nation, with a rich cultural heritage that blends influences from the mountains of the Alps, in Munich, to the Baltic Sea, in Kiel. This unique culture can be felt from Cologne, along the Rhine River, through the heart of Germany to Dresden, situated on the Elbe. Given this diversity, it's no surprise that Germany's current identity is a result of various sources and tribes.\n\nThe Germanic ancestors of the Germans hail from a land called Germania. The origin of the name is debated among scholars and historians. Tacitus suggested it came from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before crossing the Rhine to fight against the Gauls. Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between conquered Gauls and unconquered Germanic tribes. The word may have come from a neighboring Gaulish term or from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were loud or noisy.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" that he believed the Germans were original inhabitants of the area, not mixed with other races through immigration or intercourse. He questioned why anyone would leave Asia, Africa, or Italy to settle in Germania, given its harsh conditions, unless they were already from there. The Romans, too, would send out their conquests into Germania for goods and occasionally lead land campaigns, but would typically return to their vast empire. Thus, by the middle of the first century, Germanic tribes lived on the borders of the Roman Empire, trading goods and serving in the Roman army.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind devoid of thought as I took in the scene before me. Detached and observant, my consciousness analyzed the image without emotions or connections. My thoughts flowed in and out rapidly, leaving me with a liquid experience of observation rather than personal thoughts. A fellow artist once recommended a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I'd always wanted to learn to draw, and this book delves into it all, from understanding tools to understanding how our brains interpret lines. One technique it teaches is to frame a picture with a square, simplifying complex scenes into manageable parts.\n\nInitially, I couldn't apply this technique to the mess before me. I was too awestruck to do anything but stare. The toilet, a simple object, now appeared as monumental as the masterpieces of Picasso, Monet, or the Italian Renaissance artists. This was the beginning of my project, \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nI picked up the plunger, feeling a sense of purpose as my hand moved, shaping my thoughts into action. Water swirled peacefully as I tried to dislodge the clogged brown mass. My muscles tensed and relaxed, then jerked in frustration as I failed to move it. I stood, mop in hand, tie slightly uncomfortable around my neck, and stared at the offending clump of processed material. A few more flushes, and then I reached for the toilet paper roll, wrapping it around my hand to protect it. I then slowly dipped my hand into the toilet, like a mother preparing to remove the Thanksgiving turkey from the oven.",
            "Teenagers are dying on American roads due to several combined factors. The National Institutes of Health note that the adolescent brain isn't fully prepared for driving risks. Inexperience is a significant contributor, leading to more fatal crashes, rollovers, speeding, and road departures. Teenagers are also more likely to have accidents when driving with peers, a fact underscored by studies like those conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center. Although some states have implemented provisional licenses to limit driving hours and passengers, these are temporary solutions. The core problem is that teens, collectively, struggle to handle driving risks and responsibilities effectively. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 is too young for a regular driver's license, with research indicating a desire among teens under 19-20 to take risks for excitement. Thus, delaying driving until this tendency subsides could prevent future accidents. With the Baby Boomers' children reaching driving age by 2010, millions of new teen drivers will hit the roads. Legislation could address this by prohibiting anyone under 18 from driving and requiring teens to complete driver's education and a certain number of practical training hours before obtaining a full license. A uniform, national policy would protect teens across the nation, as teen driving fatalities come from various states.",
            "After browsing the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I decided to watch all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films primarily employ creative editing to create optical illusions. My analysis mainly focused on describing the poetic elements of most trick films and examining the unique traits of a few later ones. Trick films of the early 20th century are typically static, composed within a fixed, frontal proscenium, featuring no camera movement, and using long and medium shots, adhering to the one shot per film rule. However, some films from the beginning of the 20th century deviate from these norms by incorporating elements like multiple shots.\n\nA common aspect among these trick films is their filming in an interior set within a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, not moving to follow figures or objects. This style originated from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One limitation of this stage-based approach is that figures in trick films usually move side-to-side and do not walk towards or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along a horizontal axis, never approaching or leaving the frame as the camera remains fixed.\n\nThis frontal proscenium style also results in long and sometimes medium shots, but close-ups are never used in any of the Edison trick films. This mirrors the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where audiences viewed the entire performance at once, framed by the stage borders. Actors in early films typically remain in the middle ground, so close-ups are avoided.\n\nMost early trick films follow the pattern of one conceptual shot per film. This limits their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. It also restricts their narrative or dramatic scope; most focus on brief vaudeville-style tricks such as magic, disappearing, or switching acts with minimal story. However, in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes does not equate to one physical shot. A single \"shot\" may actually be composed of several joined together to create illusions like apparition or disappearance. For example, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a careful examination reveals the moment the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the entire film appears as a single conceptual shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor from Caroline was one of the early and passionate advocates for Republicanism. Although he was primarily a farmer, his political career and professional background shaped his outspoken stance on personal liberty and government. His deep commitment to an agrarian lifestyle informed his views on government, with his arguments on sovereignty, constitutional validity, and the judicial system being heavily influenced by this. Taylor believed that the United States had an opportunity to establish an ideal political system due to the lack of native traditions that could hinder its creation, allowing for a system of self-governance. He strongly believed in natural rights—interdependent rights that, if infringed, diminish the value of the remaining ones—and that these rights should be outside of government control. He argued that the \"state of nature\" allowed the strong and cunning to thrive, but in a civilized society, this must not be the case.\n\nTo achieve this ideal society, Taylor believed that the government should be designed to account for the inherent goodness and evil in humans. He had a strict dualistic view of morality, stating that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He considered good principles to be those that protect private property, improve agriculture, and discourage capitalism. He believed that a government based on these principles would function fairly regardless of its administration, which he saw as inevitably self-interested. Taylor saw self-interest as a natural human trait, but considered it evil if it led to groups exploiting others. He believed a good government was essential to curb man's natural evil and must be carefully monitored to prevent the introduction of harmful principles.\n\nLike many of his contemporaries, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, favoring a highly limited federal government with powers explicitly stated in the document. He recognized that an expansive federal government could be expensive and potentially tyrannical, but he also warned that a literal, uninterpreted approach could become corrupt. He viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, there was a sharp decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project, which was quite concerning. The exact reason for this drop is unclear. The onset of winter in a New England campus likely contributed to a decrease in bicycle and foot commuters. Additionally, December is the end of the fall semester, a time when students and faculty are preoccupied with final tasks like completing schoolwork and grading. This could have led to commuter log submissions being overlooked. Furthermore, the holiday season brings a month-long break for students and faculty, reducing the need for campus visits. The project resumed in late January, which may have contributed to the low February submissions. It's also possible that the initial enthusiasm for the project naturally faded. To counteract this, we hosted the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which boosted log submissions. However, maintaining momentum was challenging due to both a natural decrease in engagement and the impact of holiday and semester breaks on higher education. Another challenge was the deep cultural preference for driving cars, which necessitates incentives for alternative commuting methods. We offered gift certificates as incentives, but it would have been interesting to see if more substantial prizes like bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars would have increased participation. The value of the prizes remained consistent throughout the project, but increasing them over time could have potentially boosted engagement. The gift cards were sufficient initially, but announcing more attractive prizes later in the project might have helped to prevent the decrease in participation seen in December and January.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of security that aims to mirror an index, commodity, or a collection of assets like an index fund but trades like a stock on exchanges. It offers diversification like an index fund and the advantages of owning individual stocks, such as the ability to short sell, use margin, and buy in any quantity, even as little as one share. While ETFs boast these features, they carry commission fees for each trade, similar to stock transactions. ETFs also have a wide range of options available. Despite these advantages, it's essential for investors to assess if these benefits are genuine and to what extent.\n\nFor our analysis, we'll examine the ETF IHF and compare it with its top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets, to determine if owning a single ETF can approximate the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of those ten stocks. We'll also evaluate if there are better configurations of the same stocks that could yield a superior risk/reward ratio or return.\n\nTo simplify our evaluation, we'll consider only the top ten holdings. We'll use the current percentage of assets, adjusted to 100%, to calculate the contributions of each stock to the portfolio's Beta and return if the portfolio consisted solely of these ten stocks in the proportions set by the ETF's holdings. The results are presented in the chart below.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio made up of only the top 10 holdings offers a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase. Additionally, the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF's overall Beta. These findings suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower risk. However, it's possible that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different.\n\nTo determine if the portfolios are statistically different, we'll calculate and normalize the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks to compare their combined standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Dream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe's most highly regarded poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which is traced back by Mabbott to Virgil. Virgil used the term to refer to an island north of Britain, which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. While it's clear that Virgil used the term, there's a more contemporary source that should be credited. Poe had a keen interest in German authors, as evidenced by his familiarity with the works of Goethe. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" notes the similarity between Poe's and Goethe's poems, concluding that Poe was influenced by Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned writer of the poetic drama Faust, which was published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Goethe's death, 1832. Within Faust's second part, there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" This poem tells the story of a king whose wife's gift of a goblet leads to her death, causing him to drink heavily and cry, ultimately leading to his decision to end his life. This character and the description in \"Dream-Land\" share striking similarities, possibly reflecting Poe's own struggles with loss and alcohol. Faust was also adapted into a romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, less than a year before Poe used the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe references Thule twice in his collected works, once using the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land,\" serving as bookends to the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule as dark, lonely, and filled with the ghostly presence of dead friends, seen in a colorless, shaded world. This mirrors the state of the king in \"The King of Thule\" after his loss, as he too is lonely and has lost his will to rule or live, stepping into a shadowy realm. Goethe was a significant author whom Poe would have known due to his respect for Tennyson. Additionally, Poe would have been exposed to Goethe's work through the numerous reproductions following the original publication.",
            "In accordance with California law, could a customer who was hurt after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be compensated with punitive damages by demonstrating that the store manager acted with malice? The manager was informed twice about the spill and did not clean it for half an hour because he was having dinner. A judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages outright. To prove that such damages are justified, she must show that the defendant acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm and that the conduct was despicable. She can argue that the manager should have been aware of the potential harm and still failed to clean the spill, despite knowing that multiple customers had previously been injured in similar incidents. While her argument that the manager's actions were despicable may be less persuasive, the facts—six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 without proper action—support her claim. On October 13, 2009, an employee notified the manager about the spill, but he was on break and did not have time. Another employee reported the spill 15 minutes later, and he responded the same way. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, leading to a serious back injury. She is now suing for damages, and we are considering filing a motion to dismiss the punitive damages claim. Under California law, punitive damages can be awarded for a breach of non-contractual obligations if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Malice is defined as conduct that intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a willful and conscious disregard for others' rights. This is characterized as malicious when the defendant knows the probable dangerous consequences of their actions and deliberately fails to avoid them.",
            "Four years ago, I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. One of the main points of debate was whether Islam is a hostile religion. This question seems even more pertinent now, especially when considering the shift in public perception post-9/11. Initially, the media held a hostile stance towards Islam and extremists, but this has since evolved into an extreme form of tolerance for Islam in America. For instance, in 2001, it's doubtful that a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with known Muslim roots, would have been viable.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography intrigues me because it presents a character that contradicts historical accounts of his personality. Previously, I believed Muhammad compelled conversions and subdued tribes, forcing them to adopt Islam. However, the biography portrays him as a martyr, misunderstood and humble, with people gradually coming to see the truth in his teachings.\n\nMoreover, there are uncanny parallels between Jesus' teachings and Muhammad's miracles. For example, Muhammad is said to have multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men. This style of writing depicts Muhammad as a humble prophet, not requiring proof but simply living in truth and miracles. This approach, however, minimizes Jesus' life and miracles, suggesting a form of attribution by Muhammad.\n\nMany stories in the biography aim to validate 'witnesses' and self-conversions. However, these accounts often come from third-party perspectives, which diminishes their credibility. The narrative structure, with stories told through intermediaries, reduces the impact of the tales and makes them seem less genuine.\n\nWhat bothers me most is the attempt to portray Muhammad as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle man. Historical records contradict this depiction of Muhammad, and I question whether Muslims today are aware of the true history behind his rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs held by Jesus during his time were initially left behind in the evolution of Christian thought that followed. Over time, Christianity has drifted further and further from its origins. Today's world exhibits an increasing awareness and unprecedented progressive tendencies. Traditionalists, who resist any ideas beyond what they were taught, may not have enough influence to steer the whole. Christians will likely gain a deeper historical understanding in the future, leading to a desire to differentiate the doctrines added over time from Jesus' originalintentions. This reversal of Christian history, which could take decades or centuries, will involve stripping away layers of doctrine, akin to rewinding the clock, until only Jesus' original message remains. When this trend spreads through the United States and Europe, it will inspire a return to Jesus' teachings, leading to a stronger, more unified church institution. However, this reverse trend will result in reduced diversity among Christians, as different regions, denominations, and divisions become more similar. Throughout history, reversals have occurred, such as when Christians were persecuted by the Roman Empire before it became Christian. Similarly, the future's great reversal in Christianity will aim to return to the source, undoing diversity in the process. A key factor in this will be interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically, not literally. Since Jesus' lifetime, the progression of Christianity can be traced back to Judaism, with monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures at its core. When the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the Jewish population was divided into various groups, including Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "The Jungle illustrates that, at our core, humans are inherently selfish and concerned only with their own interests and comfort. People strive to improve their own lives without considering those beneath them. The factory owners and managers exemplify this, focusing solely on expanding their businesses at any cost. They disregard the environmental damage caused by their polluting factories and the suffering of their workers. According to Upton Sinclair, the \"line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" highlighting the devastation their actions unleashed. Sinclair portrays the owners' indifference to the harm caused by their factories' emissions and the animal waste from the pens at Packingtown. They also exploit their employees, prioritizing profits over workers' well-being, pushing them to work long hours and potentially lay them off without compensation or job assistance. In the era depicted, there were few laws protecting workers' safety or welfare, allowing managers and owners to operate with impunity, forcing workers to endure harsh conditions. The book implies that those who died in Packingtown were expected to accept their miserable lives without aid or advocacy. Workers had no recourse, as unions often exploited them for their own gain. The workers were so mistreated and trapped in this system that they were likened to slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\"",
            "Numerous writers employ various strategies to evoke specific feelings or attitudes in their readers regarding significant themes. Among these methods, F. Scott Fitzgerald employs several techniques in his novel \"The Great Gatsby.\" He often couples unusual adjective-noun pairs to create a particular atmosphere around a subject. Additionally, he imbues symbols with meaning and subsequently uses these symbols for the same purpose. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald assigns particular meanings to colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink, which he later employs to remind readers of feelings associated with important objects.\n\nFor instance, Fitzgerald associates the colors white and gray with uniformity, where white connotes a higher class and gray signifies age and dullness. He establishes this association early in the novel through frequent references to both colors. Characters like Daisy, Jordan, and Nick are often described as wearing white, while Tom is seen in a white shirt when he meets Myrtle. Even minor details like Nick's party attire and the apartment of Catherine, which is described as a slice of a white cake, emphasize this uniformity. Unimportant subjects are also depicted with these colors: Nick's workplace is described as \"white chasms,\" and the names on his party guest list are \"gray names.\" Moreover, Fitzgerald uses these colors to depict everyday objects and people, further reinforcing their significance.\n\nAfter building up these color associations, Fitzgerald employs them to signify indifference or uniformity. This technique first applies to Daisy. After an extended period without notable references to these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster,\" leading readers to perceive her as less of a character and more of a uniform addition that Gatsby desires. This approach is reiterated when Daisy is described as having a \"gray haze of fur collar\" and again in a white dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter, further emphasizing her role as a uniform object of desire.",
            "San Diego County is highly fertile due to its warm, sunny climate. Common crops grown here include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic, community-supported agriculture in the San Diego region is substantial, with many local groups maintaining lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Numerous organic farms offer tours of their operations and recreational activities such as hiking and birdwatching. This type of operation allows landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitat and providing educational opportunities. While organic farming can fill a profitable niche market and increase local biodiversity, it also comes with higher costs due to the need for intensive labor and management, and lower scale efficiency compared to conventional farming. Practices beneficial to wildlife, like planting cover crops or strategic grazing rotation, may also increase labor costs. Therefore, the landowner in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expert advice to balance profits and environmental conservation. The chosen parcel is located in unincorporated San Diego County, next to the Cleveland National Forest, and is part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion within the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This region is home to over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher. This area has a long history of human habitation, initially by Native Americans, and later by cattle ranchers. The land was part of an original homestead patent and likely used for grazing and/or wood production. The owner of the property researched government programs to find cost mitigation options for a small farmer and used an existing organic farm in the same area as a model.",
            "The impact of culture is substantial in any negotiation. Culture is not merely what it is, but also what it is not and what it represents. It is not monolithic or uniform, and broad generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are oversimplifications. While understanding cultural norms is useful, a successful negotiator should focus on how a culture's values and attitudes influence negotiations. When dealing with a foreign culture, one tends to relate it to their own, leading to inevitable comparisons. To comprehend a foreign culture or mindset, one might study its history and recognize its biases. Instead of criticizing or attempting to alter a culture, it's essential to accept it as it is and operate within its parameters, especially when in a weaker negotiating position or in a foreign setting. Culture extends beyond national boundaries, as companies within a nation often develop their own distinct cultures. Corporate cultures can manifest in dress codes, communication styles, hiring practices, and employee philanthropy policies. Even within the same society, there can be significant diversity in corporate culture, as seen in the variations between American companies. Some cultures present as less stratified but may still harbor deep differences. Values are crucial as they explain the \"why\" behind a culture's behavior. If saving face or harmony is valued, a negotiator will avoid public embarrassment to secure a deal. A negotiator should also learn about their opponent's personal background to enhance the negotiation's effectiveness.",
            "\"The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This phrase is first found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and it serves as the starting point for St. Anselm's argument for God's existence. Notably, it also reflects the stance of the other thinker we'll discuss, Thomas Aquinas. Both authors argue for the same God, so to compare their arguments, we'll assume they both believe in the God of the Bible. This assumption allows us to focus on their arguments specifically for this God, as any other concept of God wouldn't be relevant to their respective arguments. While both present valid points, neither truly offers a comprehensive basis for belief in God.\n\nTo begin our analysis, let's examine St. Anselm's main argument. Anselm posits that understanding God comes through faith, with the proof of God's existence residing within our own minds. He argues that since God is present in our understanding, we can't imagine God's nonexistence. Although his phrasing can be dense, the core idea is that God's existence is evident in our inherent knowledge. This concept aligns with Christian faith's acceptance of truths that lack empirical evidence.\n\nThis differs from St. Thomas Aquinas' approach. Aquinas asserts that God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, without relying on faith. This perspective would be advantageous for evangelism, as it would enable converting people through logic alone. Aquinas presents five logical arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each, he demonstrates that God's existence is logically necessary, akin to knowing the features of a missing puzzle piece without seeing it.",
            "Around 2500 years ago, a future figure, eventually known as the Buddha, was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned worldly life and became enlightened, founding Buddhism. The most traditional form of this religion is called Theravada Buddhism. Over its 2500-year history, it has evolved significantly, as seen in the annual water-cutting ceremony observed in Sri Lanka, though Buddha himself did not teach such rituals. These changes span from cultural traditions to core beliefs. Theravada Buddhism, from both monastic and lay perspectives, has adapted its teachings due to various internal and external influences, some hostile and others benign.\n\nFirst, it's crucial to understand the fundamental tenets of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists take refuge in the Three Jewels—the Buddha, the Dhamma (Buddhist teachings), and the Sangha (community of monks). The Dhamma includes the Tripitaka, comprising the Sutta Pitaka (scriptures), Vinaya Pitaka (rules of conduct), and Abhidhamma Pitaka (metaphysical concepts). Key concepts include Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these ideas is essential for escaping Sansara (the cycle of death and rebirth) and overcoming craving, hatred, and delusion. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for laypeople (five precepts: non-killing, honesty, non-stealing, chastity, and abstinence from intoxicants) and monks, with the most fundamental doctrine being the Four Noble Truths: life is suffering, attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome, and the path to overcoming suffering involves the Eightfold Path.",
            "The United States and Mexico once had a long-standing rivalry that lasted from 1836 to 1893, a rivalry marked by the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), where the U.S. defeated Mexico and gained Texas and the American Southwest. This conflict was one of many clashes between the two nations that subsided before World War I. The rivalry stemmed from disagreements over religion, culture, and material interests, much like other nations that share a border. David M. Pletcher (1977) noted that only Mexico and Cuba have had enduring issues with the U.S., due to their geographical proximity. The religious differences between the nations, rooted in the historical tension between the English and Spanish, contributed to this rivalry. According to Diehl and Goerts (2000), 17 disputes occurred during this period, primarily territorial in nature, such as Mexican raids into U.S. territory and border issues. Schmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry began to ease as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the U.S. and ended with a shift in U.S. ambitions from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico during the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became unexpectedly disabled by a previously unknown illness. At the time, I was a nurse, having chosen this profession to ensure my own safety and security, as I hadn't experienced them in my childhood. The phrase, \"You'll always have a job; people always get sick,\" constantly reinforced this decision, even though my dream was initially to be a scientist or journalist. Despite being 46, single, and with no significant savings or work capacity due to my disability, I have relied on Social Security Disability for the past 15 years. My life now is a constant struggle, and nothing feels secure. However, without the support of my family and a few friends, I wouldn't have made it this far. When facing real crises, it becomes clear that relying solely on oneself is not enough.\n\nLife always presents emergencies, big and small, and no amount of preparation can guarantee overcoming them alone. I strongly believe that we should reduce our reliance on large government systems and encourage Americans to regain trust in each other, helping one another and seeking assistance. The resilience of our forefathers was not built on rugged individualism but on compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources. Pioneers didn't cross the Rockies alone; they traveled in wagon trains.\n\nWhile I advocate being prepared for emergencies with supplies like a disaster kit, first aid, and food storage, I also stress the importance of getting to know and supporting your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the way they do? Are there limitations that influence the path of evolutionary change? Although D’Arcy Thompson noted in 1917 that \"Even now the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" this sentiment remains true today. Recent advancements have applied mathematical modeling to various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can uncover the mechanisms driving the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental changes. By analyzing X-radiographic images of Prunum species, we identified quantitative parameters for modeling hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies using the CerioShell software (Stone, 1995). We generated models of hypothetical shell morphologies to understand the boundaries of possible morphological changes in Prunum, integrating these with experimental and descriptive studies to better comprehend macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a tube that evolves over time through 360 degrees of space. These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The pace at which whorls enlarge varies, and a continuous line separates each whorl, referred to as a suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the last one, called the body whorl. The spire consists of all whorls except the last. The top of the spire is called the apex, and the bottom is the base. The animal emerges through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be examined in apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves first viewing the shell from the apical perspective and then locating the first suture. A line is drawn to divide the shell into two parts, and whorls are counted from this line, estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that move through time and space as the animal grows its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced using the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture, along with the horizontal and vertical radii. This trajectory can be both graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is established, parameters can be adjusted to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained relatively unchanged over the past decade. Despite the nation's progress towards many Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, improvements in child and maternal health are far from what's needed to meet the 2015 targets. The underlying causes of these shortfalls point to the need to bolster Indonesia's healthcare system rather than solely focusing on specific interventions.\n\nIn terms of healthcare delivery, Indonesia has seen an increase in births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% now meeting this target. However, this figure includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot provide medical interventions during complications, leading to a high number of maternal deaths from hemorrhage. Moreover, there has been a decrease in the proportion of diarrhea cases in children under five treated by a healthcare professional. Postnatal care data is incomplete, but it's evident that this is also an area of concern with low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain low at about 4%, and there's a notable disparity between urban (7%) and rural (2%) rates, indicating inequitable healthcare access across the country, with most services concentrated in urban areas. Additionally, there's a 27% gap in healthcare service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, suggesting that the poor struggle more to access services due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nIn considering how to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is how to most effectively address the lack of healthcare services. Should Indonesia develop targeted programs or strengthen the overall healthcare system, including pre- and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children? While targeted programmatic approaches have clear, manageable objectives and can generate faster results, there are drawbacks to consider. Heavy investment in one area can divert funding and human resources from others, leading to duplication of services and uncoordinated efforts.",
            "Victorian literature is renowned for its meticulous attention to detail and focus on aristocratic themes. Two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which stand out due to their use of mystery and the unusual, qualities uncommon in the era's literature. These elements enrich the characters' development by revealing their motivations and feelings. For instance, in Dickens' Oliver Twist, dream sequences are employed to delve into Oliver's psyche, providing insights into his inner turmoil and experiences. The scene where Oliver relives the shooting in Chapter 28 is a prime example, illustrating his lack of control over the situation and the enduring trauma it causes. Oliver's hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit underscore his powerlessness, and the shooting serves as a catalyst for his sense of defeat, suggesting that external forces, perhaps the influence of characters like Fagin, are shaping his despair and limiting his ability to react.\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.”",
            "A few years back, I was a tutor in an after-school program for elementary-aged students. I made efforts to assist them in subjects they were struggling with, particularly in English and reading. I was asked by one instructor to help a boy named Adrian, who was having difficulty reading. I noticed something unusual about Adrian's case; he could pronounce some letters correctly, while others were a mystery. Adrian was of Latino descent, and though he spoke English perfectly, his reading comprehension was problematic. One day, when his mother visited, she couldn't speak English, only Spanish. With my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate, and it became clear that Adrian's issue was not with reading itself, but with the English alphabet and its pronunciations. While I'm unsure if this realization helped Adrian, I hope he's doing better now. I share this story to highlight language barriers in schools, especially in California, and to illustrate that even apparent English proficiency doesn't guarantee reading comprehension. This problem is evident to all, and solutions can be complex. Adrian's case showed that targeted tutoring in English reading helped, but for children with minimal English proficiency, a combination of various approaches is essential. The dual language system is beneficial for all children, not just those whose first language is Spanish. It has been found to improve academic performance, but the idea often faces resistance due to fears of resource waste. Implementing such programs on a larger scale could benefit all students. To achieve this, bilingual aids or tutors could be employed without requiring all teachers to be bilingual.",
            "Throughout our lives, many of us are taught that there is something greater than ourselves, something we can't fully understand. Some of us learn about it in religious settings, others seek it within themselves, while some of us wholeheartedly embrace the beliefs passed down to us by our parents. Conversely, there are those who reject these ideas, believing that there is nothing beyond our personal experiences. We may adopt one belief system only to later change our minds and embrace another. Regardless of the path we choose, we define a part of our identity through our unique spiritual views. We search for a beacon of light to guide us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\nMy father's favorite bird, he said, was the cardinal. We sat on the front porch, listening to the rain batter the tin roof as we smoked. The gutters channeled the rain, drenching the plants around the porch. He stared into the rain, his gaze split between searching and reminiscing. He had lost weight, and his clothes hung loosely on him. His hair was thinner, and he avoided eye contact. I felt alone, afraid, and unable to discuss how much I would miss him with him. I hugged him, pulled my chair closer, and joined him in watching the rain fall in the June twilight.\n\nMy father passed away in December that same year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation prolonged his suffering rather than easing it, but kept him alive a few extra months beyond the doctors' projections. I couldn't comprehend the value in prolonging his suffering. If God existed, I thought, he must have stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI hadn't wanted to witness my father's passing. So, I chose not to. I didn't want to see the creator of my life end. I preferred to remember him by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than anyone else did, and I knew he wouldn't want me to watch him die. I curled up in my bed for three days, waiting for the news, but no one even called me.",
            "The classic \"Gothic Novel,\" a term coined by Ian Watt, is essentially an oxymoron, combining \"old\" and \"new\" elements. It has been both criticized and celebrated, praised for its 'terrible sublime' effect (Burke). Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the first Gothic novel, blended medieval and modern romantic ideas to establish the Gothic genre. Walpole used old theatrical elements and new mimicry of nature in modern novels to create his \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre frequently references medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. When Walpole published The Castle of Otranto, the term \"gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and periods, often viewed as archaic or unsophisticated compared to modern advancements. The fusion of the theatrical Gothic elements with the novel's new format, which offered readers an intimate view of characters' psychologies, ensured the genre's longevity and timeless appeal. Even when removed from its original context, a reader can still find it both outdated and fresh.\n\nOne prominent theme in Gothic novels is the concept of chivalry. The Castle of Otranto retains and transforms the medieval idea of chivalry, the training of a proper knight. Chivalry is significant to Gothic writers because it represents the ideal of a brave, honorable, and competent knight, and the perceived absence of those qualities in contemporary society. By incorporating chivalric ideas and practices, Gothic novels idealize and romanticize the past, hinting at the evolution towards Romanticism, and strive to improve the present. Walpole, writing during a politically tumultuous time, may have felt that the moral integrity and inherent goodness of the Gothic era had been lost in modern society. This is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies chivalric traits. Before meeting Frederic, he is described as a prince, having suffered tragedy and being presumed killed by infidels. His character, with its exaggerated chivalric imagery, exemplifies the Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the flow of activities that move goods from the point of customer order through to raw materials sourcing, production, and distribution to the customer. The term was coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described it as the process of planning, implementing, and overseeing the supply chain to meet customer needs swiftly and efficiently. Key components of supply chain management include production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nThe first step in the supply chain process is production. This is the cornerstone of the entire supply chain. Production planning involves determining when, where, how, and why goods will be produced. To make informed decisions, managers must understand customer demands. Market analysis is crucial for determining customer needs. Once market demands are understood, managers can decide which products to produce and in what quantities. The next step is choosing the most optimal location for production based on volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. After selecting a location, managers focus on scheduling workloads and equipment maintenance. Production is a critical stage in the supply chain, and meticulous planning is essential to avoid costly delays and inefficiencies.\n\nThe second key element in supply chain management is supply. Supply involves strategic decisions to determine the core capabilities of a facility and to establish partnerships for outsourcing. A company may have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with its own set of equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must choose the division best suited for each product process. Outsourcing work to other companies can enhance flexibility and reduce costs while maintaining quality. The primary goal of outsourcing is to achieve velocity, which refers to the ability to provide quality and flexibility while controlling or maintaining low costs.",
            "Hitler is alive in Myanmar, the sign reads.\n\nEllen Page, the star of Juno, stands alone at a street corner, holding a piece of cardboard with a disturbing message written on it in Sharpie. Myanmar, a Southeast Asian nation, is governed by a dictatorial military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup d'état. In 2007, public protests led by monks began, marking the first such unrest in a decade. Known as the Saffron Revolution, these protests initially saw monks gathering peacefully, but later escalated into violence between the monks and the military, with the military invading monasteries and foreign journalists being arrested and killed. While the official death count is 13, a defector from the army claimed many more people were killed. This is not an isolated incident; governments' suppression of dissent is as old as civilization itself. Examples include Roman emperors claiming divine right to rule, Japanese emperors being considered divine, and the current U.S. President having weekly calls with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide.\n\nFamous instances include the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, where students, intellectuals, and labor activists gathered to protest the government's authoritarian rule, with death tolls ranging from hundreds to thousands. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, involving Hutu militia groups and the Rwandan government systematically killing Tutsis and political moderates, is another tragic example. Hitler's 'Third Reich' saw the systematic murder of Jewish people in multiple countries.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence in jazz is largely owed to his long-lasting career and his innovative abilities to lead his orchestra. Although Ellington's piano presence is often subtle in many of his compositions, he excelled as a composer in creating intricate and detailed pieces that highlighted the individual talents of his band members. Ellington established a framework that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also crafting tightly arranged pieces that showcased each musician's unique style. This approach not only emphasized the overall tone of the orchestra but also enabled him to produce some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's sound and innovation, particularly in \"Creole Love Call,\" where he pioneered the use of the voice as a jazz instrument. This early piece demonstrates Ellington's ability to add texture and color without lyrics and his skill in complementing his soloists' styles. \"Creole Love Call\" consists of six choruses, each showcasing different musical elements and textures:\n\n- Chorus 1: A call and response between voice and reeds, starting with a smooth, melodic voice that transitions to a rougher sound.\n- Chorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that builds upon the basic melody, focusing on extended blue notes.\n- Chorus 3: A high-register clarinet solo backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n- Chorus 4: The full band mimics the first chorus with a call and response by brass and reed sections.\n- Chorus 5: The climactic chorus, with reeds initiating the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from brass and rhythm sections.\n- Chorus 6: A return to the initial structure, with call and response between voice and reeds, this time featuring the \"growl\" technique in the vocal solo.\n- Tag: A vocal run and a dissonant trombone solo end the piece.\n\nEllington's use of the voice to add tonal depth in \"Creole Love Call\" exemplifies a recurring stylistic trait in his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington combines his orchestration skills with his ear for tone color. Here, a call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing marries the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental qualities of Cox's voice to produce a rich and complementary sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further extends these concepts, with Ellington utilizing Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton on muted trombone to great effect in introducing the melody.",
            "From a young age, she felt a persistent craving that remained unfulfilled. This longing began when she was 14, during the earliest stages of her teenage years, and continued into her 17th year. Initially, she thought she wanted something tangible, but over time, her interest shifted to a desire for a romantic connection. Despite many boys being drawn to her and attempting to court her, she felt no genuine attraction. This conundrum puzzled her greatly, but she continued to question it, although she hadn't yet found a satisfactory explanation. She led a peaceful life with her parents, who were calm and understanding, apart from occasional disagreements about her independent nature. Her vibrant and fun personality complemented her kindness, making her well-liked.\n\nHowever, one day, her peaceful routine was disrupted. Hearing her mother scream from the kitchen, she rushed in to find her mother on the ground, in pain. Her mother instructed her to take her to the hospital. With her mother's directions, she carried her to the car and drove her to the hospital. The hospital's antiseptic and sickly smells were overshadowed by her mother's condition. She quickly sought help from the doctors, who rushed to assist her mother, who had fallen from a stepladder while trying to reach a high cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that sticking to a Mediterranean Diet (Med diet), indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean\" diet score, is linked to a lower risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related deaths. The \"alternate Mediterranean\" diet is a modified Mediterranean diet, characterized by higher consumption of plant-based foods (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (instead of saturated fats), and fish, with lower intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that adherence to the Med diet is inversely associated with total and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, and an intervention trial found the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in overweight individuals. However, these prior studies did not concentrate on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. Six times between 1984 and 2004, authors calculated an aMed diet score from self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to estimate nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of participants maintained involvement throughout the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified by reviewing medical or hospital records, autopsy reports, or death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone use were calculated for each FFQ. Beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation for each individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from the previous two years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that might distort results) by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the connection between the aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal cases of CHD and stroke.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years, 2391 new CHD cases, 1763 new stroke cases, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combined CHD and strokes) were identified. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a severe financial crisis. Unemployment surged, the housing market collapsed, and many major American corporations were left in shambles. This recession continues today, prompting us to question: What caused this crisis, and how can we prevent it in the future? Essentially, the crisis stemmed from greedy and naive political decisions that pressured banks and firms to offer sub-prime loans despite the financial system's immaturity and inadequacy. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were urged to back and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted, banks lacked adequate capital reserves, causing the chaos to spread to the repackaged mortgages they sold and, ultimately, to the broader economy.\n\nThe financial crisis can be traced back to 1999, during Bill Clinton's presidency, as he sought to secure a second term. To boost his popularity, the Clinton administration loosened lending restrictions, paving the way for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest home mortgage underwriter, has faced increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income individuals and from shareholders to maintain its remarkable profit growth.\" Holmes accurately predicted the consequences: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, potentially requiring a government rescue similar to the one offered to the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As mentioned earlier, and as Holmes foretold, imprudent lending would inevitably lead to an economic meltdown.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the complex mortgage structures used in the years leading up to the crisis. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were heavily used, further entangling various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to excessive leverage among U.S. households and financial markets, making them extremely sensitive to even minor price changes.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities suffered significant losses. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA's GDP. In the aftermath, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was liquidated, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become heavily regulated commercial banks. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Exposition, that moment in your narrative where you take flight with your writing skills, captivating your audience with compelling prose, or that part where your readers lose focus and either nod off or hit the back button while grumbling about your writing.

Exposition is that little voice in your head whispering to get the background out of the way to move on to the main events (not to be confused with the voice urging you to reveal every detail of your characters' histories).\n\nExposition involves conveying what happened to your audience, usually in straightforward language. In film, this occurs when one character provides a lengthy summary of information, like the monologue in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, the author is the one doing the telling.\n\nLet's take an example. While reading a story, you discover that the heroine met her love at a certain place and time, they wed in a grand manner, and her husband was slain in front of her. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to take up two pages, during which they only have two lines of dialogue each. You would expect the author to delve into the husband's character, revealing his deep love for her through his words and actions, and show how his presence enriched her life. A proper introduction to his character would allow you to become emotionally invested in his fate and gain insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, their bond's depth, clues about her thoughts and beliefs as reflected through his eyes, and so on. You would mourn his death with her, growing more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you need to provide substance to the simple storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you have to offer that substance. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, presses on*) Sometimes it's tempting to rush past certain details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and know he was once in the Air Force, now manages a night shift at a gas station, has been married twice, has no children, enjoys fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I viewed two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, a live broadcast on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011), covered a report about a man named Shad Hostettler in Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. The name of the victim was not mentioned, but Hostettler's mugshot was shown, portraying him as \"pure evil.\" The story was brief, lasting only two minutes, and provided limited details—he was arrested after stabbing her multiple times. I felt the time devoted to this story was sufficient. The second story concerned an early-morning shooting of Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old, in the Sharon Woods area. Buyers was critically injured, and no arrests were made. The SWAT team was investigating. This story seemed brief; I suspect this was due to the racial dynamics, as I've noticed that media coverage often differs when minorities are crime victims. The story about a Med-Flight helicopter with a .22 caliber rifle bullet hole was next, with Crime-Stoppers offering a $5,000 reward for the shooter's arrest. Another story addressed thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures ranging from mid- to low-eighties, presented as a teaser to keep viewers interested. A robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus was also covered, involving a dark-skinned black man in a hoodie. The man was described as six feet tall and 150 pounds, with more attention given to his race and skin color than usual. The final story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin sentenced to 300 months (or 25 years) for allegedly distributing large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. His Hispanic heritage was mentioned, but it wasn't clear why it was relevant to the story.",
            "There exists a deep connection between brothers, an unshakable, immutable bond. Embedded within this bond are numerous emotions: affection, vanity, envy, and harshness, among others. Brothers comprehend one another, more so than any other bond, and can only see themselves mirrored in their brother's eyes. It is in times of greatest peril that the essence of this bond is revealed, whether for good or ill. When these emotions are laid bare, they exact a heavy toll. A part of grasping the feelings born of this fraternal tie involves coping with the repercussions they bring. When one can gaze into their brother's eyes and see their own reflection, they perceive themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. Their actions and the consequences of those actions unveil their genuine character. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme and the accompanying tumultuous emotions. Across a richly described landscape, these two boys embark on a doomed expedition. Bitter disappointment and intense pride collide in the climactic scene, and only one brother survives. The theme is conveyed through the direct portrayal of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s viewpoint, which communicates the protagonist's complex feelings and their perspective on the world, both of which greatly influence his actions.\n\tThe protagonist's actions can be distilled into one dominant emotion: pride. From their first outing together to their final, fateful journey, the protagonist harbors resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle. He had wished for a brother to teach life skills like holding his breath, running, jumping, or climbing vines in Old Woman Swamp. He wanted a brother to compete with in races to Horsehead Landing and to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn. However, Doodle's severe heart condition made these dreams nearly impossible. The young protagonist, filled with wild fantasies, was crushed to realize these goals were unattainable. Even so, he harbored some anger towards the small child, recalling a moment when he considered suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child could entertain such a thought? However, his heart softened when Doodle smiled at him. This simple act sparked hope within him, revealing that his conviction to harm was likely not strong. Deep down, he possessed an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "The brain is a complex, inventive information-processing organ. As technology has evolved from rudimentary to advanced, so have the metaphors used to describe it. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of parchment, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you delve into brain studies, bear in mind that these metaphors are limited and can lead to faulty conclusions.\nInformation processing begins with input from your senses, which convert physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or light particles into electrical signals. The sensory data is repeatedly processed by the brain through both hierarchical and feedback processes. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, hierarchical processing combines simple data like color, orientation, and object borders to identify it as a box. Feedback processing can then help you recognize it more quickly as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in white.\nOnce information is processed, an attention mechanism decides its importance and which cognitive processes should access it. For example, while your brain scans every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, a healthy attention mechanism filters them out so you don't notice each one individually. However, you might pick out your name even in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results are repeatedly influenced by attention.\nTo process information, the brain must first store it. There are various types of memory, such as sensory, working, and long-term. Information is initially encoded based on the type of stimulus. For instance, verbal input can be encoded as visual, auditory, or semantic. Once stored, information must be kept, with working memory, which holds data for about 20 seconds, being maintained by a looping electrical signal through specific neurons. Long-term memory storage is hypothesized to involve certain proteins.\nThere are various theories on how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing from different fields like psychology, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented as nodes, with nodes linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might link to \"table,\" which can link to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the impending danger of both technological advancements and the capitalist system that upholds them through the creation of a dystopian society in his novel Brave New World. The citizens of this society prioritize community over individuality and are conditioned from birth to seek immediate happiness above all else. People are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to a singular ideology as dictated by the World Controller. Analyzing the work through a Marxist lens, one finds Huxley’s underlying concerns about the development of these systems. Terms like homogeneity and reification are frequently used to suggest that Huxley’s novel is a critique of the flaws in the emerging economy of his time.\n\nCapitalism is satirized through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, which keeps the common people unaware of their true economic relations. Instead, they are focused on their own gain, a result of ideological control over the proletariat and common laborers, as seen in the conditioning of Brave New World’s citizens. The lower classes, such as Delta and Gamma, have no independent will; instead, hypnopædia encourages consumption and indulgence. The World Controller manipulates this, and the concept of hegemony, where one group dominates another, is evident. The lower classes are unaware of this manipulation, “buying into” the ideology that supports capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes, such as Alphas and Betas, also accept their place, with few exceptions like Bernard. The interactions between social classes indicate the perceived oppression of capitalism. Relationships between individuals are superficial, as seen in characters’ comments focusing on physical appearance and encounters. The citizens’ complacency with their social status suggests the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, with Marxist thought on the proletariat being reinforced, as they are made to believe in their superiority through continued consumption and obedience.",
            "I've been a University Park student for approximately two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Navigating around campus can be challenging for many students, including myself. My first year, I stayed in an East Halls dorm, the easternmost residential area on campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. It could take up to 25 minutes to walk from my dorm to classes in distant locations like the Willard Building, especially when it's bad weather, which is common in State College. An older alumni told me that in the past, East Halls was separated from the main campus by vast, underutilized lands. Now, those spaces have been developed into sports fields, new structures like the Creamery and health services building, and apartments, as the campus continues to grow. This expansion has made movement around campus increasingly difficult.\n\nThe solution to this mobility issue lies in cycling, but it's not effective unless students use bicycles and the campus is designed to accommodate them. My friend, who recently restarted cycling after years of hiatus, agreed that bikes are the best way to get around campus. Apart from being good for health, cycling is also the most efficient mode of transport. A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of exercise can take you 30 miles or more. I currently live off-campus, equidistant from the center as some dorms. The best decision I've made this year was to buy a bike. Usually, it takes me 25 minutes to walk to my classes in Thomas building. Biking can reduce this time to 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. However, Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas, isn't always easy to bike on. While walking also has its advantages, I lack the time due to my busy schedule. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only option, adding an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily routine, which amounts to over two and a half hours each week, not to mention the time spent walking to other classes, appointments, and more."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about.

While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "My aim in pursuing a social work degree is to work with the Division of Family and Children Services, assisting abused or neglected children and supporting troubled families. The values I bring to the field are service, respect, integrity, a commitment to fostering positive relationships, and continuous professional development. These values aren't just important for social workers; they are deeply personal to me.\n\nGrowing up, I wanted to help others, but I wasn't sure which career path to choose. Throughout high school and college, I saw many people avoid their problems through denial and unhealthy coping mechanisms. Inspired by these experiences, I decided to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, unsure of my future career. Upon graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break. One day, a friend introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was escaping his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he had called the police. I visited the boy's parents, expressing my concerns to the police. The parents seemed nervous and blamed their son for involving outsiders in \"simple\" disputes. This experience sparked my interest in a career in social work to help children navigate family conflicts.\n\nSocial justice is another value crucial to the social work field. Society claims to value individuals but often follows outdated traditions, not true uniqueness. I believe in individuality and standing against social injustices. Throughout my education, I stood up against injustice by expressing my personality through unnatural hair colors, unique clothing, piercings, involvement in GSBA, and fighting against racism and discrimination. I will continue to advocate for social justice.",
            "This paper examines the Biological and Sociocultural models in the context of insomnia. The Biological model explores the genetic and medical components of sleep disorders, while the Sociocultural model examines the environmental influences, such as race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia discusses these models and interprets the research selected to explain them. It also evaluates the research findings, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be categorized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder linked to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while those related to mental disorders are linked to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical issues or substance intake. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia is characterized by difficulty in obtaining or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is a problem with staying awake. Narcolepsy involves sudden loss of muscle tone (cataplexy) and/or automatic behaviors during REM sleep. Dyssomnias deal with sleep initiation and maintenance, whereas Parasomnias are characterized by behavioral and physiological abnormalities during sleep, including Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The review primarily focuses on insomnia and primary sleep disorders, in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders centers on genetics, inherited factors, and physiological aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that the GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons control sleep/wake cycles. When activated, GABAA receptors promote sleep, but if inhibited, they can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep time in mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). This suggests that the findings in mice can be extrapolated to humans, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor. Disruptions in this receptor could impair sleep quality without medication. Socioculturally, if the receptor phenotype is inherited, it could influence sleep, and any alteration could negatively affect daily life, including school, career, and tasks requiring focus.",
            "This paper explores three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with a brief explanation of what CAPD is. Next, it outlines the diagnosis process, including common signs or \"red flags\". Finally, it offers strategies for teachers in mainstream classrooms to support students with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is a condition that affects how efficiently and effectively the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. Essentially, it's a disorder where the brain struggles to process sounds correctly, even though the person can hear normally. This is because the brain area responsible for interpreting and distinguishing between sounds and conversations does not function as it should.\n\nThe concept of CAPD can be traced back to the mid-1950s, initially referred to as \"auditory imperception\" by researchers studying children with communication disorders. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started developing tests for these children in 1954. In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the neurobiology behind dichotic perception. The disorder gained more attention in 1977 following a national conference that stimulated further research.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways: a person might struggle to locate or hear sounds in space, distinguish between multiple sounds, recognize sound patterns, detect changes in speech like sarcasm, be unable to filter out one sound from another, or struggle to understand the sequence of auditory information.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD typically involves systematic observation of listening behaviors and performance on auditory function tests, which can be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists (SLPs), psychologists, and others. These tests may include questionnaires, observations of auditory behaviors, and more advanced tests that record acoustic signals within the ear. There's currently no single, consistent diagnostic tool or known cause for CAPD.",
            "\"Twelfth Night suggests that while disguise can be a powerful tool for long-term deception, ultimately, one must shed that false identity to avoid losing their true self. However, ending a deception can lead to isolation since one may find themselves alienated. This dilemma requires choosing between preserving oneself or maintaining relationships. While some may respond calmly to the revelation, others may be offended by the deception. The theme of deception in gender role reversal is particularly complex, as it raises questions about why an individual would alter their identity. In Viola's case, the deception is a means of self-preservation: 'I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…' (5.1.247-249) Arriving in an unfamiliar land, Viola feels compelled to disguise herself as a man to protect herself from potential attackers. Her ruse succeeds, but it also isolates her from women, depriving her of necessary support. Moreover, her convincing performance as a man leads Olivia to mistake her for Sebastian and fall in love: 'Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.' (5.1.138) Additionally, Viola must grapple with suppressed romantic feelings towards Orsino: 'Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.' (5.1.260-261) This, although progressive by Renaissance standards, may seem to modern readers as an exploration of how deception can reveal hidden emotions, particularly for Olivia and Orsino. The play hints that these characters might have unacknowledged desires forced into the open by Viola's deception. For instance, does Olivia's affection for Cesario stem from Cesario's male appearance, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? It's likely not the latter, as Olivia seems to judge people based on appearances, as seen in her swift change of affection from Cesario to Sebastian and her view of Cesario/Viola as a sister rather than a love interest: 'A sister, you are she.' (5.1.315)",
            "German colonial rule has been widely recognized for its harshness, particularly in connection with the genocide against the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, it would be inaccurate to attribute the entire empire to such a simple characterization; it varied greatly in policies and governance, as well as in educational provision. For instance, in German East Africa (Tanganyika), a substantial number of educated and literate Africans existed by 1919 due to the British finding a well-established educational system. Similarly, educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were commended by contemporary authors. The scenario in South West Africa (now Namibia) was notably different. Unlike East Africa, where the government played a significant role in educating natives via state schools, the responsibility for native education in South West Africa was largely left to missionary societies, receiving minimal government support. The colonial government, however, invested heavily in the education of Europeans, setting up state schools and supporting missionary schools. These educational policies has lasting impacts on South West Africa, even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies boasted many literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa \"the vast majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate.\" Several social, political, and economic factors contributed to this stark contrast. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors and focus on new research regarding the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities toward native Africans.\n\nThere is a considerable amount of scholarly work on education within the German colonial empire, with many sources available in German and written during or shortly after the colonial period. Early works primarily aimed to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later English-language works expanded on this by comparing education across different German colonies and conducting more in-depth analyses. These studies highlighted significant variations in educational systems among German colonies. Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa is particularly relevant to this topic. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that contributed to their differences. According to Cohen, the sizeable settler population in South West Africa explains many of its unique educational system characteristics.\n\nCompared to other German colonial territories, South West Africa had a relatively mild climate, although much of the land is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected these more favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, significantly more than the approximately 5,336 Europeans in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has expanded significantly over the past 100 years, encompassing numerous genres that are difficult to list entirely. This is further complicated by the fact that most genres, such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have given birth to multiple sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. Interestingly, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has emerged as one of the most varied and expressive forms of popular music over the past 40 years. Its expressiveness stems from its wide range of emotions, which often lean towards darker themes. The genre's diversity is evident in its ability to adapt and evolve, leading to the creation of various sub-genres and further divisions, a trend that continues today.\n\nCurrent heavy metal music has developed into a complex landscape with numerous sub-niches, making it challenging to define what constitutes heavy metal. It has absorbed themes from other genres but, like any movement, has its roots in a specific origin. To comprehend today's metal music, one must first understand the essence of the metal movement and why it transcends a simple genre classification.\n\nMetal is often described as a movement characterized by darkness, embodying a \"more\" approach—more bass, volume, violence, and theatricality, while also showcasing musicianship and skill. It is also marked by a culture of drug use, particularly during the psychedelic drug boom of the mid-70s, which inspired musicians to create intense, otherworldly music. The movement draws heavily from the dark, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era, as seen in songs like \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles, which is considered one of the first heavy metal tracks. The lyrics reflect the darker side of the movement:",
            "A few decades prior to the Surrealists' dreamlike paintings, Henri Rousseau was already crafting his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. The Dream, a 1910 artwork by the renowned Post-Impressionist, showcases a woman in awe of the wonders in her dream, as well as Rousseau’s personal aspirations and internal conflicts as an artist. Throughout his career, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and praise from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, but grappled with the choice between conforming to established styles or maintaining his unique artistic identity. The Dream encapsulates this lifelong internal struggle: to either imitate existing styles or forge his own path. To comprehend The Dream from this perspective, one should first acquaint oneself with Rousseau's biography. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, his father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle. Without formal art training, Rousseau worked as a gabelou, a municipal toll service employee, until the age of forty, earning the nickname douanier. After losing his first wife and eight infant children, he found solace in painting, using it as a new beginning. Unlike his contemporaries who idealized and romanticized the peasant in their art, Rousseau was a folk painter, reflecting the hopes and dreams of the common people. His desire for acceptance in the art world is understandable, as he lacked formal education and started his career late, working alongside more talented and recognized artists like Matisse. As Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters, while both artists were competitors, their motivations differed: Matisse was driven by a fear of painting trite subjects, while Rousseau sought to paint conventionally to gain acceptance from the Artiste Français.",
            "Numerous influential thinkers have proposed a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, as well as truth and beauty. I argue that this connection has a fundamental basis. As John Keats asserts in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- / That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of our knowledge comes from education or experience, we often appreciate ethics and aesthetics without formal instruction. Both fields aim to explain rather than dictate; studying morality or beauty seeks to understand why something is good art or moral, rather than providing rules for judgment or creation. Critiques of art or morality rarely capture the essence of what is good or beautiful. For instance, discussions about the Mona Lisa may focus on elements like contrast or context, yet they don't pinpoint why it is great art. When asked about favorite works, people often say, \"There's just something about it,\" indicating a deeper, indescribable quality. Both art and morality possess this transcendental nature, as Flannery O'Connor maintains, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...\". This je ne sais quoi is a potent attribute of art and morality, bridging the gap between them. I believe that our experience of morality and art is profoundly emotional, or \"noumenal\" in Kantian terms, impacting us deeply yet defying comprehensive explanation, especially in literature. As McKean says, \"Literature's moral quality is what sets it apart, making it unique among the arts. While moral standards may not apply to all arts, they're as relevant to literature as they are to life itself.\"",
            "Today's Germany is considered a powerful, unified nation, with a rich cultural heritage that blends influences from the mountains of the Alps, in Munich, to the Baltic Sea, in Kiel. This unique culture can be felt from Cologne, along the Rhine River, through the heart of Germany to Dresden, situated on the Elbe. Given this diversity, it's no surprise that Germany's current identity is a result of various sources and tribes.\n\nThe Germanic ancestors of the Germans hail from a land called Germania. The origin of the name is debated among scholars and historians. Tacitus suggested it came from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before crossing the Rhine to fight against the Gauls. Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between conquered Gauls and unconquered Germanic tribes. The word may have come from a neighboring Gaulish term or from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were loud or noisy.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" that he believed the Germans were original inhabitants of the area, not mixed with other races through immigration or intercourse. He questioned why anyone would leave Asia, Africa, or Italy to settle in Germania, given its harsh conditions, unless they were already from there. The Romans, too, would send out their conquests into Germania for goods and occasionally lead land campaigns, but would typically return to their vast empire. Thus, by the middle of the first century, Germanic tribes lived on the borders of the Roman Empire, trading goods and serving in the Roman army.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind devoid of thought as I took in the scene before me. Detached and observant, my consciousness analyzed the image without emotions or connections. My thoughts flowed in and out rapidly, leaving me with a liquid experience of observation rather than personal thoughts. A fellow artist once recommended a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I'd always wanted to learn to draw, and this book delves into it all, from understanding tools to understanding how our brains interpret lines. One technique it teaches is to frame a picture with a square, simplifying complex scenes into manageable parts.\n\nInitially, I couldn't apply this technique to the mess before me. I was too awestruck to do anything but stare. The toilet, a simple object, now appeared as monumental as the masterpieces of Picasso, Monet, or the Italian Renaissance artists. This was the beginning of my project, \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nI picked up the plunger, feeling a sense of purpose as my hand moved, shaping my thoughts into action. Water swirled peacefully as I tried to dislodge the clogged brown mass. My muscles tensed and relaxed, then jerked in frustration as I failed to move it. I stood, mop in hand, tie slightly uncomfortable around my neck, and stared at the offending clump of processed material. A few more flushes, and then I reached for the toilet paper roll, wrapping it around my hand to protect it. I then slowly dipped my hand into the toilet, like a mother preparing to remove the Thanksgiving turkey from the oven.",
            "Teenagers are dying on American roads due to several combined factors. The National Institutes of Health note that the adolescent brain isn't fully prepared for driving risks. Inexperience is a significant contributor, leading to more fatal crashes, rollovers, speeding, and road departures. Teenagers are also more likely to have accidents when driving with peers, a fact underscored by studies like those conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center. Although some states have implemented provisional licenses to limit driving hours and passengers, these are temporary solutions. The core problem is that teens, collectively, struggle to handle driving risks and responsibilities effectively. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 is too young for a regular driver's license, with research indicating a desire among teens under 19-20 to take risks for excitement. Thus, delaying driving until this tendency subsides could prevent future accidents. With the Baby Boomers' children reaching driving age by 2010, millions of new teen drivers will hit the roads. Legislation could address this by prohibiting anyone under 18 from driving and requiring teens to complete driver's education and a certain number of practical training hours before obtaining a full license. A uniform, national policy would protect teens across the nation, as teen driving fatalities come from various states.",
            "After browsing the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I decided to watch all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films primarily employ creative editing to create optical illusions. My analysis mainly focused on describing the poetic elements of most trick films and examining the unique traits of a few later ones. Trick films of the early 20th century are typically static, composed within a fixed, frontal proscenium, featuring no camera movement, and using long and medium shots, adhering to the one shot per film rule. However, some films from the beginning of the 20th century deviate from these norms by incorporating elements like multiple shots.\n\nA common aspect among these trick films is their filming in an interior set within a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, not moving to follow figures or objects. This style originated from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One limitation of this stage-based approach is that figures in trick films usually move side-to-side and do not walk towards or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along a horizontal axis, never approaching or leaving the frame as the camera remains fixed.\n\nThis frontal proscenium style also results in long and sometimes medium shots, but close-ups are never used in any of the Edison trick films. This mirrors the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where audiences viewed the entire performance at once, framed by the stage borders. Actors in early films typically remain in the middle ground, so close-ups are avoided.\n\nMost early trick films follow the pattern of one conceptual shot per film. This limits their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. It also restricts their narrative or dramatic scope; most focus on brief vaudeville-style tricks such as magic, disappearing, or switching acts with minimal story. However, in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes does not equate to one physical shot. A single \"shot\" may actually be composed of several joined together to create illusions like apparition or disappearance. For example, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a careful examination reveals the moment the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the entire film appears as a single conceptual shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor from Caroline was one of the early and passionate advocates for Republicanism. Although he was primarily a farmer, his political career and professional background shaped his outspoken stance on personal liberty and government. His deep commitment to an agrarian lifestyle informed his views on government, with his arguments on sovereignty, constitutional validity, and the judicial system being heavily influenced by this. Taylor believed that the United States had an opportunity to establish an ideal political system due to the lack of native traditions that could hinder its creation, allowing for a system of self-governance. He strongly believed in natural rights—interdependent rights that, if infringed, diminish the value of the remaining ones—and that these rights should be outside of government control. He argued that the \"state of nature\" allowed the strong and cunning to thrive, but in a civilized society, this must not be the case.\n\nTo achieve this ideal society, Taylor believed that the government should be designed to account for the inherent goodness and evil in humans. He had a strict dualistic view of morality, stating that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He considered good principles to be those that protect private property, improve agriculture, and discourage capitalism. He believed that a government based on these principles would function fairly regardless of its administration, which he saw as inevitably self-interested. Taylor saw self-interest as a natural human trait, but considered it evil if it led to groups exploiting others. He believed a good government was essential to curb man's natural evil and must be carefully monitored to prevent the introduction of harmful principles.\n\nLike many of his contemporaries, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, favoring a highly limited federal government with powers explicitly stated in the document. He recognized that an expansive federal government could be expensive and potentially tyrannical, but he also warned that a literal, uninterpreted approach could become corrupt. He viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, there was a sharp decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project, which was quite concerning. The exact reason for this drop is unclear. The onset of winter in a New England campus likely contributed to a decrease in bicycle and foot commuters. Additionally, December is the end of the fall semester, a time when students and faculty are preoccupied with final tasks like completing schoolwork and grading. This could have led to commuter log submissions being overlooked. Furthermore, the holiday season brings a month-long break for students and faculty, reducing the need for campus visits. The project resumed in late January, which may have contributed to the low February submissions. It's also possible that the initial enthusiasm for the project naturally faded. To counteract this, we hosted the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which boosted log submissions. However, maintaining momentum was challenging due to both a natural decrease in engagement and the impact of holiday and semester breaks on higher education. Another challenge was the deep cultural preference for driving cars, which necessitates incentives for alternative commuting methods. We offered gift certificates as incentives, but it would have been interesting to see if more substantial prizes like bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars would have increased participation. The value of the prizes remained consistent throughout the project, but increasing them over time could have potentially boosted engagement. The gift cards were sufficient initially, but announcing more attractive prizes later in the project might have helped to prevent the decrease in participation seen in December and January.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of security that aims to mirror an index, commodity, or a collection of assets like an index fund but trades like a stock on exchanges. It offers diversification like an index fund and the advantages of owning individual stocks, such as the ability to short sell, use margin, and buy in any quantity, even as little as one share. While ETFs boast these features, they carry commission fees for each trade, similar to stock transactions. ETFs also have a wide range of options available. Despite these advantages, it's essential for investors to assess if these benefits are genuine and to what extent.\n\nFor our analysis, we'll examine the ETF IHF and compare it with its top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets, to determine if owning a single ETF can approximate the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of those ten stocks. We'll also evaluate if there are better configurations of the same stocks that could yield a superior risk/reward ratio or return.\n\nTo simplify our evaluation, we'll consider only the top ten holdings. We'll use the current percentage of assets, adjusted to 100%, to calculate the contributions of each stock to the portfolio's Beta and return if the portfolio consisted solely of these ten stocks in the proportions set by the ETF's holdings. The results are presented in the chart below.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio made up of only the top 10 holdings offers a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase. Additionally, the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF's overall Beta. These findings suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower risk. However, it's possible that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different.\n\nTo determine if the portfolios are statistically different, we'll calculate and normalize the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks to compare their combined standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Dream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe's most highly regarded poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which is traced back by Mabbott to Virgil. Virgil used the term to refer to an island north of Britain, which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. While it's clear that Virgil used the term, there's a more contemporary source that should be credited. Poe had a keen interest in German authors, as evidenced by his familiarity with the works of Goethe. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" notes the similarity between Poe's and Goethe's poems, concluding that Poe was influenced by Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned writer of the poetic drama Faust, which was published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Goethe's death, 1832. Within Faust's second part, there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" This poem tells the story of a king whose wife's gift of a goblet leads to her death, causing him to drink heavily and cry, ultimately leading to his decision to end his life. This character and the description in \"Dream-Land\" share striking similarities, possibly reflecting Poe's own struggles with loss and alcohol. Faust was also adapted into a romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, less than a year before Poe used the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe references Thule twice in his collected works, once using the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land,\" serving as bookends to the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule as dark, lonely, and filled with the ghostly presence of dead friends, seen in a colorless, shaded world. This mirrors the state of the king in \"The King of Thule\" after his loss, as he too is lonely and has lost his will to rule or live, stepping into a shadowy realm. Goethe was a significant author whom Poe would have known due to his respect for Tennyson. Additionally, Poe would have been exposed to Goethe's work through the numerous reproductions following the original publication.",
            "In accordance with California law, could a customer who was hurt after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be compensated with punitive damages by demonstrating that the store manager acted with malice? The manager was informed twice about the spill and did not clean it for half an hour because he was having dinner. A judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages outright. To prove that such damages are justified, she must show that the defendant acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm and that the conduct was despicable. She can argue that the manager should have been aware of the potential harm and still failed to clean the spill, despite knowing that multiple customers had previously been injured in similar incidents. While her argument that the manager's actions were despicable may be less persuasive, the facts—six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 without proper action—support her claim. On October 13, 2009, an employee notified the manager about the spill, but he was on break and did not have time. Another employee reported the spill 15 minutes later, and he responded the same way. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, leading to a serious back injury. She is now suing for damages, and we are considering filing a motion to dismiss the punitive damages claim. Under California law, punitive damages can be awarded for a breach of non-contractual obligations if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Malice is defined as conduct that intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a willful and conscious disregard for others' rights. This is characterized as malicious when the defendant knows the probable dangerous consequences of their actions and deliberately fails to avoid them.",
            "Four years ago, I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. One of the main points of debate was whether Islam is a hostile religion. This question seems even more pertinent now, especially when considering the shift in public perception post-9/11. Initially, the media held a hostile stance towards Islam and extremists, but this has since evolved into an extreme form of tolerance for Islam in America. For instance, in 2001, it's doubtful that a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with known Muslim roots, would have been viable.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography intrigues me because it presents a character that contradicts historical accounts of his personality. Previously, I believed Muhammad compelled conversions and subdued tribes, forcing them to adopt Islam. However, the biography portrays him as a martyr, misunderstood and humble, with people gradually coming to see the truth in his teachings.\n\nMoreover, there are uncanny parallels between Jesus' teachings and Muhammad's miracles. For example, Muhammad is said to have multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men. This style of writing depicts Muhammad as a humble prophet, not requiring proof but simply living in truth and miracles. This approach, however, minimizes Jesus' life and miracles, suggesting a form of attribution by Muhammad.\n\nMany stories in the biography aim to validate 'witnesses' and self-conversions. However, these accounts often come from third-party perspectives, which diminishes their credibility. The narrative structure, with stories told through intermediaries, reduces the impact of the tales and makes them seem less genuine.\n\nWhat bothers me most is the attempt to portray Muhammad as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle man. Historical records contradict this depiction of Muhammad, and I question whether Muslims today are aware of the true history behind his rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs held by Jesus during his time were initially left behind in the evolution of Christian thought that followed. Over time, Christianity has drifted further and further from its origins. Today's world exhibits an increasing awareness and unprecedented progressive tendencies. Traditionalists, who resist any ideas beyond what they were taught, may not have enough influence to steer the whole. Christians will likely gain a deeper historical understanding in the future, leading to a desire to differentiate the doctrines added over time from Jesus' originalintentions. This reversal of Christian history, which could take decades or centuries, will involve stripping away layers of doctrine, akin to rewinding the clock, until only Jesus' original message remains. When this trend spreads through the United States and Europe, it will inspire a return to Jesus' teachings, leading to a stronger, more unified church institution. However, this reverse trend will result in reduced diversity among Christians, as different regions, denominations, and divisions become more similar. Throughout history, reversals have occurred, such as when Christians were persecuted by the Roman Empire before it became Christian. Similarly, the future's great reversal in Christianity will aim to return to the source, undoing diversity in the process. A key factor in this will be interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically, not literally. Since Jesus' lifetime, the progression of Christianity can be traced back to Judaism, with monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures at its core. When the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the Jewish population was divided into various groups, including Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "The Jungle illustrates that, at our core, humans are inherently selfish and concerned only with their own interests and comfort. People strive to improve their own lives without considering those beneath them. The factory owners and managers exemplify this, focusing solely on expanding their businesses at any cost. They disregard the environmental damage caused by their polluting factories and the suffering of their workers. According to Upton Sinclair, the \"line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" highlighting the devastation their actions unleashed. Sinclair portrays the owners' indifference to the harm caused by their factories' emissions and the animal waste from the pens at Packingtown. They also exploit their employees, prioritizing profits over workers' well-being, pushing them to work long hours and potentially lay them off without compensation or job assistance. In the era depicted, there were few laws protecting workers' safety or welfare, allowing managers and owners to operate with impunity, forcing workers to endure harsh conditions. The book implies that those who died in Packingtown were expected to accept their miserable lives without aid or advocacy. Workers had no recourse, as unions often exploited them for their own gain. The workers were so mistreated and trapped in this system that they were likened to slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\"",
            "Numerous writers employ various strategies to evoke specific feelings or attitudes in their readers regarding significant themes. Among these methods, F. Scott Fitzgerald employs several techniques in his novel \"The Great Gatsby.\" He often couples unusual adjective-noun pairs to create a particular atmosphere around a subject. Additionally, he imbues symbols with meaning and subsequently uses these symbols for the same purpose. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald assigns particular meanings to colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink, which he later employs to remind readers of feelings associated with important objects.\n\nFor instance, Fitzgerald associates the colors white and gray with uniformity, where white connotes a higher class and gray signifies age and dullness. He establishes this association early in the novel through frequent references to both colors. Characters like Daisy, Jordan, and Nick are often described as wearing white, while Tom is seen in a white shirt when he meets Myrtle. Even minor details like Nick's party attire and the apartment of Catherine, which is described as a slice of a white cake, emphasize this uniformity. Unimportant subjects are also depicted with these colors: Nick's workplace is described as \"white chasms,\" and the names on his party guest list are \"gray names.\" Moreover, Fitzgerald uses these colors to depict everyday objects and people, further reinforcing their significance.\n\nAfter building up these color associations, Fitzgerald employs them to signify indifference or uniformity. This technique first applies to Daisy. After an extended period without notable references to these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster,\" leading readers to perceive her as less of a character and more of a uniform addition that Gatsby desires. This approach is reiterated when Daisy is described as having a \"gray haze of fur collar\" and again in a white dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter, further emphasizing her role as a uniform object of desire.",
            "San Diego County is highly fertile due to its warm, sunny climate. Common crops grown here include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic, community-supported agriculture in the San Diego region is substantial, with many local groups maintaining lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Numerous organic farms offer tours of their operations and recreational activities such as hiking and birdwatching. This type of operation allows landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitat and providing educational opportunities. While organic farming can fill a profitable niche market and increase local biodiversity, it also comes with higher costs due to the need for intensive labor and management, and lower scale efficiency compared to conventional farming. Practices beneficial to wildlife, like planting cover crops or strategic grazing rotation, may also increase labor costs. Therefore, the landowner in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expert advice to balance profits and environmental conservation. The chosen parcel is located in unincorporated San Diego County, next to the Cleveland National Forest, and is part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion within the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This region is home to over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher. This area has a long history of human habitation, initially by Native Americans, and later by cattle ranchers. The land was part of an original homestead patent and likely used for grazing and/or wood production. The owner of the property researched government programs to find cost mitigation options for a small farmer and used an existing organic farm in the same area as a model.",
            "The impact of culture is substantial in any negotiation. Culture is not merely what it is, but also what it is not and what it represents. It is not monolithic or uniform, and broad generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are oversimplifications. While understanding cultural norms is useful, a successful negotiator should focus on how a culture's values and attitudes influence negotiations. When dealing with a foreign culture, one tends to relate it to their own, leading to inevitable comparisons. To comprehend a foreign culture or mindset, one might study its history and recognize its biases. Instead of criticizing or attempting to alter a culture, it's essential to accept it as it is and operate within its parameters, especially when in a weaker negotiating position or in a foreign setting. Culture extends beyond national boundaries, as companies within a nation often develop their own distinct cultures. Corporate cultures can manifest in dress codes, communication styles, hiring practices, and employee philanthropy policies. Even within the same society, there can be significant diversity in corporate culture, as seen in the variations between American companies. Some cultures present as less stratified but may still harbor deep differences. Values are crucial as they explain the \"why\" behind a culture's behavior. If saving face or harmony is valued, a negotiator will avoid public embarrassment to secure a deal. A negotiator should also learn about their opponent's personal background to enhance the negotiation's effectiveness.",
            "\"The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This phrase is first found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and it serves as the starting point for St. Anselm's argument for God's existence. Notably, it also reflects the stance of the other thinker we'll discuss, Thomas Aquinas. Both authors argue for the same God, so to compare their arguments, we'll assume they both believe in the God of the Bible. This assumption allows us to focus on their arguments specifically for this God, as any other concept of God wouldn't be relevant to their respective arguments. While both present valid points, neither truly offers a comprehensive basis for belief in God.\n\nTo begin our analysis, let's examine St. Anselm's main argument. Anselm posits that understanding God comes through faith, with the proof of God's existence residing within our own minds. He argues that since God is present in our understanding, we can't imagine God's nonexistence. Although his phrasing can be dense, the core idea is that God's existence is evident in our inherent knowledge. This concept aligns with Christian faith's acceptance of truths that lack empirical evidence.\n\nThis differs from St. Thomas Aquinas' approach. Aquinas asserts that God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, without relying on faith. This perspective would be advantageous for evangelism, as it would enable converting people through logic alone. Aquinas presents five logical arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each, he demonstrates that God's existence is logically necessary, akin to knowing the features of a missing puzzle piece without seeing it.",
            "Around 2500 years ago, a future figure, eventually known as the Buddha, was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned worldly life and became enlightened, founding Buddhism. The most traditional form of this religion is called Theravada Buddhism. Over its 2500-year history, it has evolved significantly, as seen in the annual water-cutting ceremony observed in Sri Lanka, though Buddha himself did not teach such rituals. These changes span from cultural traditions to core beliefs. Theravada Buddhism, from both monastic and lay perspectives, has adapted its teachings due to various internal and external influences, some hostile and others benign.\n\nFirst, it's crucial to understand the fundamental tenets of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists take refuge in the Three Jewels—the Buddha, the Dhamma (Buddhist teachings), and the Sangha (community of monks). The Dhamma includes the Tripitaka, comprising the Sutta Pitaka (scriptures), Vinaya Pitaka (rules of conduct), and Abhidhamma Pitaka (metaphysical concepts). Key concepts include Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these ideas is essential for escaping Sansara (the cycle of death and rebirth) and overcoming craving, hatred, and delusion. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for laypeople (five precepts: non-killing, honesty, non-stealing, chastity, and abstinence from intoxicants) and monks, with the most fundamental doctrine being the Four Noble Truths: life is suffering, attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome, and the path to overcoming suffering involves the Eightfold Path.",
            "The United States and Mexico once had a long-standing rivalry that lasted from 1836 to 1893, a rivalry marked by the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), where the U.S. defeated Mexico and gained Texas and the American Southwest. This conflict was one of many clashes between the two nations that subsided before World War I. The rivalry stemmed from disagreements over religion, culture, and material interests, much like other nations that share a border. David M. Pletcher (1977) noted that only Mexico and Cuba have had enduring issues with the U.S., due to their geographical proximity. The religious differences between the nations, rooted in the historical tension between the English and Spanish, contributed to this rivalry. According to Diehl and Goerts (2000), 17 disputes occurred during this period, primarily territorial in nature, such as Mexican raids into U.S. territory and border issues. Schmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry began to ease as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the U.S. and ended with a shift in U.S. ambitions from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico during the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became unexpectedly disabled by a previously unknown illness. At the time, I was a nurse, having chosen this profession to ensure my own safety and security, as I hadn't experienced them in my childhood. The phrase, \"You'll always have a job; people always get sick,\" constantly reinforced this decision, even though my dream was initially to be a scientist or journalist. Despite being 46, single, and with no significant savings or work capacity due to my disability, I have relied on Social Security Disability for the past 15 years. My life now is a constant struggle, and nothing feels secure. However, without the support of my family and a few friends, I wouldn't have made it this far. When facing real crises, it becomes clear that relying solely on oneself is not enough.\n\nLife always presents emergencies, big and small, and no amount of preparation can guarantee overcoming them alone. I strongly believe that we should reduce our reliance on large government systems and encourage Americans to regain trust in each other, helping one another and seeking assistance. The resilience of our forefathers was not built on rugged individualism but on compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources. Pioneers didn't cross the Rockies alone; they traveled in wagon trains.\n\nWhile I advocate being prepared for emergencies with supplies like a disaster kit, first aid, and food storage, I also stress the importance of getting to know and supporting your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the way they do? Are there limitations that influence the path of evolutionary change? Although D’Arcy Thompson noted in 1917 that \"Even now the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" this sentiment remains true today. Recent advancements have applied mathematical modeling to various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can uncover the mechanisms driving the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental changes. By analyzing X-radiographic images of Prunum species, we identified quantitative parameters for modeling hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies using the CerioShell software (Stone, 1995). We generated models of hypothetical shell morphologies to understand the boundaries of possible morphological changes in Prunum, integrating these with experimental and descriptive studies to better comprehend macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a tube that evolves over time through 360 degrees of space. These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The pace at which whorls enlarge varies, and a continuous line separates each whorl, referred to as a suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the last one, called the body whorl. The spire consists of all whorls except the last. The top of the spire is called the apex, and the bottom is the base. The animal emerges through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be examined in apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves first viewing the shell from the apical perspective and then locating the first suture. A line is drawn to divide the shell into two parts, and whorls are counted from this line, estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that move through time and space as the animal grows its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced using the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture, along with the horizontal and vertical radii. This trajectory can be both graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is established, parameters can be adjusted to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained relatively unchanged over the past decade. Despite the nation's progress towards many Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, improvements in child and maternal health are far from what's needed to meet the 2015 targets. The underlying causes of these shortfalls point to the need to bolster Indonesia's healthcare system rather than solely focusing on specific interventions.\n\nIn terms of healthcare delivery, Indonesia has seen an increase in births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% now meeting this target. However, this figure includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot provide medical interventions during complications, leading to a high number of maternal deaths from hemorrhage. Moreover, there has been a decrease in the proportion of diarrhea cases in children under five treated by a healthcare professional. Postnatal care data is incomplete, but it's evident that this is also an area of concern with low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain low at about 4%, and there's a notable disparity between urban (7%) and rural (2%) rates, indicating inequitable healthcare access across the country, with most services concentrated in urban areas. Additionally, there's a 27% gap in healthcare service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, suggesting that the poor struggle more to access services due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nIn considering how to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is how to most effectively address the lack of healthcare services. Should Indonesia develop targeted programs or strengthen the overall healthcare system, including pre- and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children? While targeted programmatic approaches have clear, manageable objectives and can generate faster results, there are drawbacks to consider. Heavy investment in one area can divert funding and human resources from others, leading to duplication of services and uncoordinated efforts.",
            "Victorian literature is renowned for its meticulous attention to detail and focus on aristocratic themes. Two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which stand out due to their use of mystery and the unusual, qualities uncommon in the era's literature. These elements enrich the characters' development by revealing their motivations and feelings. For instance, in Dickens' Oliver Twist, dream sequences are employed to delve into Oliver's psyche, providing insights into his inner turmoil and experiences. The scene where Oliver relives the shooting in Chapter 28 is a prime example, illustrating his lack of control over the situation and the enduring trauma it causes. Oliver's hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit underscore his powerlessness, and the shooting serves as a catalyst for his sense of defeat, suggesting that external forces, perhaps the influence of characters like Fagin, are shaping his despair and limiting his ability to react.\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.”",
            "A few years back, I was a tutor in an after-school program for elementary-aged students. I made efforts to assist them in subjects they were struggling with, particularly in English and reading. I was asked by one instructor to help a boy named Adrian, who was having difficulty reading. I noticed something unusual about Adrian's case; he could pronounce some letters correctly, while others were a mystery. Adrian was of Latino descent, and though he spoke English perfectly, his reading comprehension was problematic. One day, when his mother visited, she couldn't speak English, only Spanish. With my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate, and it became clear that Adrian's issue was not with reading itself, but with the English alphabet and its pronunciations. While I'm unsure if this realization helped Adrian, I hope he's doing better now. I share this story to highlight language barriers in schools, especially in California, and to illustrate that even apparent English proficiency doesn't guarantee reading comprehension. This problem is evident to all, and solutions can be complex. Adrian's case showed that targeted tutoring in English reading helped, but for children with minimal English proficiency, a combination of various approaches is essential. The dual language system is beneficial for all children, not just those whose first language is Spanish. It has been found to improve academic performance, but the idea often faces resistance due to fears of resource waste. Implementing such programs on a larger scale could benefit all students. To achieve this, bilingual aids or tutors could be employed without requiring all teachers to be bilingual.",
            "Throughout our lives, many of us are taught that there is something greater than ourselves, something we can't fully understand. Some of us learn about it in religious settings, others seek it within themselves, while some of us wholeheartedly embrace the beliefs passed down to us by our parents. Conversely, there are those who reject these ideas, believing that there is nothing beyond our personal experiences. We may adopt one belief system only to later change our minds and embrace another. Regardless of the path we choose, we define a part of our identity through our unique spiritual views. We search for a beacon of light to guide us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\nMy father's favorite bird, he said, was the cardinal. We sat on the front porch, listening to the rain batter the tin roof as we smoked. The gutters channeled the rain, drenching the plants around the porch. He stared into the rain, his gaze split between searching and reminiscing. He had lost weight, and his clothes hung loosely on him. His hair was thinner, and he avoided eye contact. I felt alone, afraid, and unable to discuss how much I would miss him with him. I hugged him, pulled my chair closer, and joined him in watching the rain fall in the June twilight.\n\nMy father passed away in December that same year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation prolonged his suffering rather than easing it, but kept him alive a few extra months beyond the doctors' projections. I couldn't comprehend the value in prolonging his suffering. If God existed, I thought, he must have stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI hadn't wanted to witness my father's passing. So, I chose not to. I didn't want to see the creator of my life end. I preferred to remember him by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than anyone else did, and I knew he wouldn't want me to watch him die. I curled up in my bed for three days, waiting for the news, but no one even called me.",
            "The classic \"Gothic Novel,\" a term coined by Ian Watt, is essentially an oxymoron, combining \"old\" and \"new\" elements. It has been both criticized and celebrated, praised for its 'terrible sublime' effect (Burke). Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the first Gothic novel, blended medieval and modern romantic ideas to establish the Gothic genre. Walpole used old theatrical elements and new mimicry of nature in modern novels to create his \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre frequently references medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. When Walpole published The Castle of Otranto, the term \"gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and periods, often viewed as archaic or unsophisticated compared to modern advancements. The fusion of the theatrical Gothic elements with the novel's new format, which offered readers an intimate view of characters' psychologies, ensured the genre's longevity and timeless appeal. Even when removed from its original context, a reader can still find it both outdated and fresh.\n\nOne prominent theme in Gothic novels is the concept of chivalry. The Castle of Otranto retains and transforms the medieval idea of chivalry, the training of a proper knight. Chivalry is significant to Gothic writers because it represents the ideal of a brave, honorable, and competent knight, and the perceived absence of those qualities in contemporary society. By incorporating chivalric ideas and practices, Gothic novels idealize and romanticize the past, hinting at the evolution towards Romanticism, and strive to improve the present. Walpole, writing during a politically tumultuous time, may have felt that the moral integrity and inherent goodness of the Gothic era had been lost in modern society. This is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies chivalric traits. Before meeting Frederic, he is described as a prince, having suffered tragedy and being presumed killed by infidels. His character, with its exaggerated chivalric imagery, exemplifies the Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the flow of activities that move goods from the point of customer order through to raw materials sourcing, production, and distribution to the customer. The term was coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described it as the process of planning, implementing, and overseeing the supply chain to meet customer needs swiftly and efficiently. Key components of supply chain management include production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nThe first step in the supply chain process is production. This is the cornerstone of the entire supply chain. Production planning involves determining when, where, how, and why goods will be produced. To make informed decisions, managers must understand customer demands. Market analysis is crucial for determining customer needs. Once market demands are understood, managers can decide which products to produce and in what quantities. The next step is choosing the most optimal location for production based on volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. After selecting a location, managers focus on scheduling workloads and equipment maintenance. Production is a critical stage in the supply chain, and meticulous planning is essential to avoid costly delays and inefficiencies.\n\nThe second key element in supply chain management is supply. Supply involves strategic decisions to determine the core capabilities of a facility and to establish partnerships for outsourcing. A company may have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with its own set of equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must choose the division best suited for each product process. Outsourcing work to other companies can enhance flexibility and reduce costs while maintaining quality. The primary goal of outsourcing is to achieve velocity, which refers to the ability to provide quality and flexibility while controlling or maintaining low costs.",
            "Hitler is alive in Myanmar, the sign reads.\n\nEllen Page, the star of Juno, stands alone at a street corner, holding a piece of cardboard with a disturbing message written on it in Sharpie. Myanmar, a Southeast Asian nation, is governed by a dictatorial military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup d'état. In 2007, public protests led by monks began, marking the first such unrest in a decade. Known as the Saffron Revolution, these protests initially saw monks gathering peacefully, but later escalated into violence between the monks and the military, with the military invading monasteries and foreign journalists being arrested and killed. While the official death count is 13, a defector from the army claimed many more people were killed. This is not an isolated incident; governments' suppression of dissent is as old as civilization itself. Examples include Roman emperors claiming divine right to rule, Japanese emperors being considered divine, and the current U.S. President having weekly calls with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide.\n\nFamous instances include the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, where students, intellectuals, and labor activists gathered to protest the government's authoritarian rule, with death tolls ranging from hundreds to thousands. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, involving Hutu militia groups and the Rwandan government systematically killing Tutsis and political moderates, is another tragic example. Hitler's 'Third Reich' saw the systematic murder of Jewish people in multiple countries.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence in jazz is largely owed to his long-lasting career and his innovative abilities to lead his orchestra. Although Ellington's piano presence is often subtle in many of his compositions, he excelled as a composer in creating intricate and detailed pieces that highlighted the individual talents of his band members. Ellington established a framework that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also crafting tightly arranged pieces that showcased each musician's unique style. This approach not only emphasized the overall tone of the orchestra but also enabled him to produce some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's sound and innovation, particularly in \"Creole Love Call,\" where he pioneered the use of the voice as a jazz instrument. This early piece demonstrates Ellington's ability to add texture and color without lyrics and his skill in complementing his soloists' styles. \"Creole Love Call\" consists of six choruses, each showcasing different musical elements and textures:\n\n- Chorus 1: A call and response between voice and reeds, starting with a smooth, melodic voice that transitions to a rougher sound.\n- Chorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that builds upon the basic melody, focusing on extended blue notes.\n- Chorus 3: A high-register clarinet solo backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n- Chorus 4: The full band mimics the first chorus with a call and response by brass and reed sections.\n- Chorus 5: The climactic chorus, with reeds initiating the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from brass and rhythm sections.\n- Chorus 6: A return to the initial structure, with call and response between voice and reeds, this time featuring the \"growl\" technique in the vocal solo.\n- Tag: A vocal run and a dissonant trombone solo end the piece.\n\nEllington's use of the voice to add tonal depth in \"Creole Love Call\" exemplifies a recurring stylistic trait in his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington combines his orchestration skills with his ear for tone color. Here, a call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing marries the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental qualities of Cox's voice to produce a rich and complementary sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further extends these concepts, with Ellington utilizing Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton on muted trombone to great effect in introducing the melody.",
            "From a young age, she felt a persistent craving that remained unfulfilled. This longing began when she was 14, during the earliest stages of her teenage years, and continued into her 17th year. Initially, she thought she wanted something tangible, but over time, her interest shifted to a desire for a romantic connection. Despite many boys being drawn to her and attempting to court her, she felt no genuine attraction. This conundrum puzzled her greatly, but she continued to question it, although she hadn't yet found a satisfactory explanation. She led a peaceful life with her parents, who were calm and understanding, apart from occasional disagreements about her independent nature. Her vibrant and fun personality complemented her kindness, making her well-liked.\n\nHowever, one day, her peaceful routine was disrupted. Hearing her mother scream from the kitchen, she rushed in to find her mother on the ground, in pain. Her mother instructed her to take her to the hospital. With her mother's directions, she carried her to the car and drove her to the hospital. The hospital's antiseptic and sickly smells were overshadowed by her mother's condition. She quickly sought help from the doctors, who rushed to assist her mother, who had fallen from a stepladder while trying to reach a high cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that sticking to a Mediterranean Diet (Med diet), indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean\" diet score, is linked to a lower risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related deaths. The \"alternate Mediterranean\" diet is a modified Mediterranean diet, characterized by higher consumption of plant-based foods (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (instead of saturated fats), and fish, with lower intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that adherence to the Med diet is inversely associated with total and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, and an intervention trial found the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in overweight individuals. However, these prior studies did not concentrate on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. Six times between 1984 and 2004, authors calculated an aMed diet score from self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to estimate nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of participants maintained involvement throughout the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified by reviewing medical or hospital records, autopsy reports, or death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone use were calculated for each FFQ. Beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation for each individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from the previous two years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that might distort results) by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the connection between the aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal cases of CHD and stroke.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years, 2391 new CHD cases, 1763 new stroke cases, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combined CHD and strokes) were identified. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a severe financial crisis. Unemployment surged, the housing market collapsed, and many major American corporations were left in shambles. This recession continues today, prompting us to question: What caused this crisis, and how can we prevent it in the future? Essentially, the crisis stemmed from greedy and naive political decisions that pressured banks and firms to offer sub-prime loans despite the financial system's immaturity and inadequacy. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were urged to back and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted, banks lacked adequate capital reserves, causing the chaos to spread to the repackaged mortgages they sold and, ultimately, to the broader economy.\n\nThe financial crisis can be traced back to 1999, during Bill Clinton's presidency, as he sought to secure a second term. To boost his popularity, the Clinton administration loosened lending restrictions, paving the way for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest home mortgage underwriter, has faced increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income individuals and from shareholders to maintain its remarkable profit growth.\" Holmes accurately predicted the consequences: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, potentially requiring a government rescue similar to the one offered to the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As mentioned earlier, and as Holmes foretold, imprudent lending would inevitably lead to an economic meltdown.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the complex mortgage structures used in the years leading up to the crisis. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were heavily used, further entangling various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to excessive leverage among U.S. households and financial markets, making them extremely sensitive to even minor price changes.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities suffered significant losses. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA's GDP. In the aftermath, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was liquidated, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become heavily regulated commercial banks. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Exposition, that moment in your narrative where you take flight with your writing skills, captivating your audience with compelling prose, or that part where your readers lose focus and either nod off or hit the back button while grumbling about your writing. Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her screen when she encounters excessive information, not even in an amusing way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy dear readers are probably already familiar with the writing advice, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin often falls into the trap of writing long passages where nothing significant happens, or even worse, too much. Exposition is that little voice in your head whispering to get the background out of the way to move on to the main events (not to be confused with the voice urging you to reveal every detail of your characters' histories).\n\nExposition involves conveying what happened to your audience, usually in straightforward language. In film, this occurs when one character provides a lengthy summary of information, like the monologue in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, the author is the one doing the telling.\n\nLet's take an example. While reading a story, you discover that the heroine met her love at a certain place and time, they wed in a grand manner, and her husband was slain in front of her. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to take up two pages, during which they only have two lines of dialogue each. You would expect the author to delve into the husband's character, revealing his deep love for her through his words and actions, and show how his presence enriched her life. A proper introduction to his character would allow you to become emotionally invested in his fate and gain insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, their bond's depth, clues about her thoughts and beliefs as reflected through his eyes, and so on. You would mourn his death with her, growing more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you need to provide substance to the simple storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you have to offer that substance. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, presses on*) Sometimes it's tempting to rush past certain details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and know he was once in the Air Force, now manages a night shift at a gas station, has been married twice, has no children, enjoys fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I viewed two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, a live broadcast on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011), covered a report about a man named Shad Hostettler in Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. The name of the victim was not mentioned, but Hostettler's mugshot was shown, portraying him as \"pure evil.\" The story was brief, lasting only two minutes, and provided limited details—he was arrested after stabbing her multiple times. I felt the time devoted to this story was sufficient. The second story concerned an early-morning shooting of Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old, in the Sharon Woods area. Buyers was critically injured, and no arrests were made. The SWAT team was investigating. This story seemed brief; I suspect this was due to the racial dynamics, as I've noticed that media coverage often differs when minorities are crime victims. The story about a Med-Flight helicopter with a .22 caliber rifle bullet hole was next, with Crime-Stoppers offering a $5,000 reward for the shooter's arrest. Another story addressed thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures ranging from mid- to low-eighties, presented as a teaser to keep viewers interested. A robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus was also covered, involving a dark-skinned black man in a hoodie. The man was described as six feet tall and 150 pounds, with more attention given to his race and skin color than usual. The final story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin sentenced to 300 months (or 25 years) for allegedly distributing large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. His Hispanic heritage was mentioned, but it wasn't clear why it was relevant to the story.",
            "There exists a deep connection between brothers, an unshakable, immutable bond. Embedded within this bond are numerous emotions: affection, vanity, envy, and harshness, among others. Brothers comprehend one another, more so than any other bond, and can only see themselves mirrored in their brother's eyes. It is in times of greatest peril that the essence of this bond is revealed, whether for good or ill. When these emotions are laid bare, they exact a heavy toll. A part of grasping the feelings born of this fraternal tie involves coping with the repercussions they bring. When one can gaze into their brother's eyes and see their own reflection, they perceive themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. Their actions and the consequences of those actions unveil their genuine character. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme and the accompanying tumultuous emotions. Across a richly described landscape, these two boys embark on a doomed expedition. Bitter disappointment and intense pride collide in the climactic scene, and only one brother survives. The theme is conveyed through the direct portrayal of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s viewpoint, which communicates the protagonist's complex feelings and their perspective on the world, both of which greatly influence his actions.\n\tThe protagonist's actions can be distilled into one dominant emotion: pride. From their first outing together to their final, fateful journey, the protagonist harbors resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle. He had wished for a brother to teach life skills like holding his breath, running, jumping, or climbing vines in Old Woman Swamp. He wanted a brother to compete with in races to Horsehead Landing and to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn. However, Doodle's severe heart condition made these dreams nearly impossible. The young protagonist, filled with wild fantasies, was crushed to realize these goals were unattainable. Even so, he harbored some anger towards the small child, recalling a moment when he considered suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child could entertain such a thought? However, his heart softened when Doodle smiled at him. This simple act sparked hope within him, revealing that his conviction to harm was likely not strong. Deep down, he possessed an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "The brain is a complex, inventive information-processing organ. As technology has evolved from rudimentary to advanced, so have the metaphors used to describe it. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of parchment, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you delve into brain studies, bear in mind that these metaphors are limited and can lead to faulty conclusions.\nInformation processing begins with input from your senses, which convert physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or light particles into electrical signals. The sensory data is repeatedly processed by the brain through both hierarchical and feedback processes. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, hierarchical processing combines simple data like color, orientation, and object borders to identify it as a box. Feedback processing can then help you recognize it more quickly as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in white.\nOnce information is processed, an attention mechanism decides its importance and which cognitive processes should access it. For example, while your brain scans every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, a healthy attention mechanism filters them out so you don't notice each one individually. However, you might pick out your name even in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results are repeatedly influenced by attention.\nTo process information, the brain must first store it. There are various types of memory, such as sensory, working, and long-term. Information is initially encoded based on the type of stimulus. For instance, verbal input can be encoded as visual, auditory, or semantic. Once stored, information must be kept, with working memory, which holds data for about 20 seconds, being maintained by a looping electrical signal through specific neurons. Long-term memory storage is hypothesized to involve certain proteins.\nThere are various theories on how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing from different fields like psychology, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented as nodes, with nodes linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might link to \"table,\" which can link to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the impending danger of both technological advancements and the capitalist system that upholds them through the creation of a dystopian society in his novel Brave New World. The citizens of this society prioritize community over individuality and are conditioned from birth to seek immediate happiness above all else. People are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to a singular ideology as dictated by the World Controller. Analyzing the work through a Marxist lens, one finds Huxley’s underlying concerns about the development of these systems. Terms like homogeneity and reification are frequently used to suggest that Huxley’s novel is a critique of the flaws in the emerging economy of his time.\n\nCapitalism is satirized through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, which keeps the common people unaware of their true economic relations. Instead, they are focused on their own gain, a result of ideological control over the proletariat and common laborers, as seen in the conditioning of Brave New World’s citizens. The lower classes, such as Delta and Gamma, have no independent will; instead, hypnopædia encourages consumption and indulgence. The World Controller manipulates this, and the concept of hegemony, where one group dominates another, is evident. The lower classes are unaware of this manipulation, “buying into” the ideology that supports capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes, such as Alphas and Betas, also accept their place, with few exceptions like Bernard. The interactions between social classes indicate the perceived oppression of capitalism. Relationships between individuals are superficial, as seen in characters’ comments focusing on physical appearance and encounters. The citizens’ complacency with their social status suggests the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, with Marxist thought on the proletariat being reinforced, as they are made to believe in their superiority through continued consumption and obedience.",
            "I've been a University Park student for approximately two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Navigating around campus can be challenging for many students, including myself. My first year, I stayed in an East Halls dorm, the easternmost residential area on campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. It could take up to 25 minutes to walk from my dorm to classes in distant locations like the Willard Building, especially when it's bad weather, which is common in State College. An older alumni told me that in the past, East Halls was separated from the main campus by vast, underutilized lands. Now, those spaces have been developed into sports fields, new structures like the Creamery and health services building, and apartments, as the campus continues to grow. This expansion has made movement around campus increasingly difficult.\n\nThe solution to this mobility issue lies in cycling, but it's not effective unless students use bicycles and the campus is designed to accommodate them. My friend, who recently restarted cycling after years of hiatus, agreed that bikes are the best way to get around campus. Apart from being good for health, cycling is also the most efficient mode of transport. A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of exercise can take you 30 miles or more. I currently live off-campus, equidistant from the center as some dorms. The best decision I've made this year was to buy a bike. Usually, it takes me 25 minutes to walk to my classes in Thomas building. Biking can reduce this time to 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. However, Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas, isn't always easy to bike on. While walking also has its advantages, I lack the time due to my busy schedule. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only option, adding an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily routine, which amounts to over two and a half hours each week, not to mention the time spent walking to other classes, appointments, and more."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about.

While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "My aim in pursuing a social work degree is to work with the Division of Family and Children Services, assisting abused or neglected children and supporting troubled families. The values I bring to the field are service, respect, integrity, a commitment to fostering positive relationships, and continuous professional development. These values aren't just important for social workers; they are deeply personal to me.\n\nGrowing up, I wanted to help others, but I wasn't sure which career path to choose. Throughout high school and college, I saw many people avoid their problems through denial and unhealthy coping mechanisms. Inspired by these experiences, I decided to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, unsure of my future career. Upon graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break. One day, a friend introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was escaping his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he had called the police. I visited the boy's parents, expressing my concerns to the police. The parents seemed nervous and blamed their son for involving outsiders in \"simple\" disputes. This experience sparked my interest in a career in social work to help children navigate family conflicts.\n\nSocial justice is another value crucial to the social work field. Society claims to value individuals but often follows outdated traditions, not true uniqueness. I believe in individuality and standing against social injustices. Throughout my education, I stood up against injustice by expressing my personality through unnatural hair colors, unique clothing, piercings, involvement in GSBA, and fighting against racism and discrimination. I will continue to advocate for social justice.",
            "This paper examines the Biological and Sociocultural models in the context of insomnia. The Biological model explores the genetic and medical components of sleep disorders, while the Sociocultural model examines the environmental influences, such as race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia discusses these models and interprets the research selected to explain them. It also evaluates the research findings, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be categorized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder linked to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while those related to mental disorders are linked to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical issues or substance intake. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia is characterized by difficulty in obtaining or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is a problem with staying awake. Narcolepsy involves sudden loss of muscle tone (cataplexy) and/or automatic behaviors during REM sleep. Dyssomnias deal with sleep initiation and maintenance, whereas Parasomnias are characterized by behavioral and physiological abnormalities during sleep, including Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The review primarily focuses on insomnia and primary sleep disorders, in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders centers on genetics, inherited factors, and physiological aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that the GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons control sleep/wake cycles. When activated, GABAA receptors promote sleep, but if inhibited, they can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep time in mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). This suggests that the findings in mice can be extrapolated to humans, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor. Disruptions in this receptor could impair sleep quality without medication. Socioculturally, if the receptor phenotype is inherited, it could influence sleep, and any alteration could negatively affect daily life, including school, career, and tasks requiring focus.",
            "This paper explores three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with a brief explanation of what CAPD is. Next, it outlines the diagnosis process, including common signs or \"red flags\". Finally, it offers strategies for teachers in mainstream classrooms to support students with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is a condition that affects how efficiently and effectively the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. Essentially, it's a disorder where the brain struggles to process sounds correctly, even though the person can hear normally. This is because the brain area responsible for interpreting and distinguishing between sounds and conversations does not function as it should.\n\nThe concept of CAPD can be traced back to the mid-1950s, initially referred to as \"auditory imperception\" by researchers studying children with communication disorders. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started developing tests for these children in 1954. In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the neurobiology behind dichotic perception. The disorder gained more attention in 1977 following a national conference that stimulated further research.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways: a person might struggle to locate or hear sounds in space, distinguish between multiple sounds, recognize sound patterns, detect changes in speech like sarcasm, be unable to filter out one sound from another, or struggle to understand the sequence of auditory information.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD typically involves systematic observation of listening behaviors and performance on auditory function tests, which can be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists (SLPs), psychologists, and others. These tests may include questionnaires, observations of auditory behaviors, and more advanced tests that record acoustic signals within the ear. There's currently no single, consistent diagnostic tool or known cause for CAPD.",
            "\"Twelfth Night suggests that while disguise can be a powerful tool for long-term deception, ultimately, one must shed that false identity to avoid losing their true self. However, ending a deception can lead to isolation since one may find themselves alienated. This dilemma requires choosing between preserving oneself or maintaining relationships. While some may respond calmly to the revelation, others may be offended by the deception. The theme of deception in gender role reversal is particularly complex, as it raises questions about why an individual would alter their identity. In Viola's case, the deception is a means of self-preservation: 'I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…' (5.1.247-249) Arriving in an unfamiliar land, Viola feels compelled to disguise herself as a man to protect herself from potential attackers. Her ruse succeeds, but it also isolates her from women, depriving her of necessary support. Moreover, her convincing performance as a man leads Olivia to mistake her for Sebastian and fall in love: 'Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.' (5.1.138) Additionally, Viola must grapple with suppressed romantic feelings towards Orsino: 'Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.' (5.1.260-261) This, although progressive by Renaissance standards, may seem to modern readers as an exploration of how deception can reveal hidden emotions, particularly for Olivia and Orsino. The play hints that these characters might have unacknowledged desires forced into the open by Viola's deception. For instance, does Olivia's affection for Cesario stem from Cesario's male appearance, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? It's likely not the latter, as Olivia seems to judge people based on appearances, as seen in her swift change of affection from Cesario to Sebastian and her view of Cesario/Viola as a sister rather than a love interest: 'A sister, you are she.' (5.1.315)",
            "German colonial rule has been widely recognized for its harshness, particularly in connection with the genocide against the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, it would be inaccurate to attribute the entire empire to such a simple characterization; it varied greatly in policies and governance, as well as in educational provision. For instance, in German East Africa (Tanganyika), a substantial number of educated and literate Africans existed by 1919 due to the British finding a well-established educational system. Similarly, educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were commended by contemporary authors. The scenario in South West Africa (now Namibia) was notably different. Unlike East Africa, where the government played a significant role in educating natives via state schools, the responsibility for native education in South West Africa was largely left to missionary societies, receiving minimal government support. The colonial government, however, invested heavily in the education of Europeans, setting up state schools and supporting missionary schools. These educational policies has lasting impacts on South West Africa, even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies boasted many literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa \"the vast majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate.\" Several social, political, and economic factors contributed to this stark contrast. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors and focus on new research regarding the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities toward native Africans.\n\nThere is a considerable amount of scholarly work on education within the German colonial empire, with many sources available in German and written during or shortly after the colonial period. Early works primarily aimed to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later English-language works expanded on this by comparing education across different German colonies and conducting more in-depth analyses. These studies highlighted significant variations in educational systems among German colonies. Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa is particularly relevant to this topic. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that contributed to their differences. According to Cohen, the sizeable settler population in South West Africa explains many of its unique educational system characteristics.\n\nCompared to other German colonial territories, South West Africa had a relatively mild climate, although much of the land is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected these more favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, significantly more than the approximately 5,336 Europeans in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has expanded significantly over the past 100 years, encompassing numerous genres that are difficult to list entirely. This is further complicated by the fact that most genres, such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have given birth to multiple sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. Interestingly, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has emerged as one of the most varied and expressive forms of popular music over the past 40 years. Its expressiveness stems from its wide range of emotions, which often lean towards darker themes. The genre's diversity is evident in its ability to adapt and evolve, leading to the creation of various sub-genres and further divisions, a trend that continues today.\n\nCurrent heavy metal music has developed into a complex landscape with numerous sub-niches, making it challenging to define what constitutes heavy metal. It has absorbed themes from other genres but, like any movement, has its roots in a specific origin. To comprehend today's metal music, one must first understand the essence of the metal movement and why it transcends a simple genre classification.\n\nMetal is often described as a movement characterized by darkness, embodying a \"more\" approach—more bass, volume, violence, and theatricality, while also showcasing musicianship and skill. It is also marked by a culture of drug use, particularly during the psychedelic drug boom of the mid-70s, which inspired musicians to create intense, otherworldly music. The movement draws heavily from the dark, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era, as seen in songs like \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles, which is considered one of the first heavy metal tracks. The lyrics reflect the darker side of the movement:",
            "A few decades prior to the Surrealists' dreamlike paintings, Henri Rousseau was already crafting his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. The Dream, a 1910 artwork by the renowned Post-Impressionist, showcases a woman in awe of the wonders in her dream, as well as Rousseau’s personal aspirations and internal conflicts as an artist. Throughout his career, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and praise from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, but grappled with the choice between conforming to established styles or maintaining his unique artistic identity. The Dream encapsulates this lifelong internal struggle: to either imitate existing styles or forge his own path. To comprehend The Dream from this perspective, one should first acquaint oneself with Rousseau's biography. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, his father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle. Without formal art training, Rousseau worked as a gabelou, a municipal toll service employee, until the age of forty, earning the nickname douanier. After losing his first wife and eight infant children, he found solace in painting, using it as a new beginning. Unlike his contemporaries who idealized and romanticized the peasant in their art, Rousseau was a folk painter, reflecting the hopes and dreams of the common people. His desire for acceptance in the art world is understandable, as he lacked formal education and started his career late, working alongside more talented and recognized artists like Matisse. As Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters, while both artists were competitors, their motivations differed: Matisse was driven by a fear of painting trite subjects, while Rousseau sought to paint conventionally to gain acceptance from the Artiste Français.",
            "Numerous influential thinkers have proposed a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, as well as truth and beauty. I argue that this connection has a fundamental basis. As John Keats asserts in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- / That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of our knowledge comes from education or experience, we often appreciate ethics and aesthetics without formal instruction. Both fields aim to explain rather than dictate; studying morality or beauty seeks to understand why something is good art or moral, rather than providing rules for judgment or creation. Critiques of art or morality rarely capture the essence of what is good or beautiful. For instance, discussions about the Mona Lisa may focus on elements like contrast or context, yet they don't pinpoint why it is great art. When asked about favorite works, people often say, \"There's just something about it,\" indicating a deeper, indescribable quality. Both art and morality possess this transcendental nature, as Flannery O'Connor maintains, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...\". This je ne sais quoi is a potent attribute of art and morality, bridging the gap between them. I believe that our experience of morality and art is profoundly emotional, or \"noumenal\" in Kantian terms, impacting us deeply yet defying comprehensive explanation, especially in literature. As McKean says, \"Literature's moral quality is what sets it apart, making it unique among the arts. While moral standards may not apply to all arts, they're as relevant to literature as they are to life itself.\"",
            "Today's Germany is considered a powerful, unified nation, with a rich cultural heritage that blends influences from the mountains of the Alps, in Munich, to the Baltic Sea, in Kiel. This unique culture can be felt from Cologne, along the Rhine River, through the heart of Germany to Dresden, situated on the Elbe. Given this diversity, it's no surprise that Germany's current identity is a result of various sources and tribes.\n\nThe Germanic ancestors of the Germans hail from a land called Germania. The origin of the name is debated among scholars and historians. Tacitus suggested it came from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before crossing the Rhine to fight against the Gauls. Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between conquered Gauls and unconquered Germanic tribes. The word may have come from a neighboring Gaulish term or from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were loud or noisy.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" that he believed the Germans were original inhabitants of the area, not mixed with other races through immigration or intercourse. He questioned why anyone would leave Asia, Africa, or Italy to settle in Germania, given its harsh conditions, unless they were already from there. The Romans, too, would send out their conquests into Germania for goods and occasionally lead land campaigns, but would typically return to their vast empire. Thus, by the middle of the first century, Germanic tribes lived on the borders of the Roman Empire, trading goods and serving in the Roman army.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind devoid of thought as I took in the scene before me. Detached and observant, my consciousness analyzed the image without emotions or connections. My thoughts flowed in and out rapidly, leaving me with a liquid experience of observation rather than personal thoughts. A fellow artist once recommended a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I'd always wanted to learn to draw, and this book delves into it all, from understanding tools to understanding how our brains interpret lines. One technique it teaches is to frame a picture with a square, simplifying complex scenes into manageable parts.\n\nInitially, I couldn't apply this technique to the mess before me. I was too awestruck to do anything but stare. The toilet, a simple object, now appeared as monumental as the masterpieces of Picasso, Monet, or the Italian Renaissance artists. This was the beginning of my project, \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nI picked up the plunger, feeling a sense of purpose as my hand moved, shaping my thoughts into action. Water swirled peacefully as I tried to dislodge the clogged brown mass. My muscles tensed and relaxed, then jerked in frustration as I failed to move it. I stood, mop in hand, tie slightly uncomfortable around my neck, and stared at the offending clump of processed material. A few more flushes, and then I reached for the toilet paper roll, wrapping it around my hand to protect it. I then slowly dipped my hand into the toilet, like a mother preparing to remove the Thanksgiving turkey from the oven.",
            "Teenagers are dying on American roads due to several combined factors. The National Institutes of Health note that the adolescent brain isn't fully prepared for driving risks. Inexperience is a significant contributor, leading to more fatal crashes, rollovers, speeding, and road departures. Teenagers are also more likely to have accidents when driving with peers, a fact underscored by studies like those conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center. Although some states have implemented provisional licenses to limit driving hours and passengers, these are temporary solutions. The core problem is that teens, collectively, struggle to handle driving risks and responsibilities effectively. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 is too young for a regular driver's license, with research indicating a desire among teens under 19-20 to take risks for excitement. Thus, delaying driving until this tendency subsides could prevent future accidents. With the Baby Boomers' children reaching driving age by 2010, millions of new teen drivers will hit the roads. Legislation could address this by prohibiting anyone under 18 from driving and requiring teens to complete driver's education and a certain number of practical training hours before obtaining a full license. A uniform, national policy would protect teens across the nation, as teen driving fatalities come from various states.",
            "After browsing the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I decided to watch all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films primarily employ creative editing to create optical illusions. My analysis mainly focused on describing the poetic elements of most trick films and examining the unique traits of a few later ones. Trick films of the early 20th century are typically static, composed within a fixed, frontal proscenium, featuring no camera movement, and using long and medium shots, adhering to the one shot per film rule. However, some films from the beginning of the 20th century deviate from these norms by incorporating elements like multiple shots.\n\nA common aspect among these trick films is their filming in an interior set within a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, not moving to follow figures or objects. This style originated from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One limitation of this stage-based approach is that figures in trick films usually move side-to-side and do not walk towards or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along a horizontal axis, never approaching or leaving the frame as the camera remains fixed.\n\nThis frontal proscenium style also results in long and sometimes medium shots, but close-ups are never used in any of the Edison trick films. This mirrors the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where audiences viewed the entire performance at once, framed by the stage borders. Actors in early films typically remain in the middle ground, so close-ups are avoided.\n\nMost early trick films follow the pattern of one conceptual shot per film. This limits their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. It also restricts their narrative or dramatic scope; most focus on brief vaudeville-style tricks such as magic, disappearing, or switching acts with minimal story. However, in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes does not equate to one physical shot. A single \"shot\" may actually be composed of several joined together to create illusions like apparition or disappearance. For example, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a careful examination reveals the moment the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the entire film appears as a single conceptual shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor from Caroline was one of the early and passionate advocates for Republicanism. Although he was primarily a farmer, his political career and professional background shaped his outspoken stance on personal liberty and government. His deep commitment to an agrarian lifestyle informed his views on government, with his arguments on sovereignty, constitutional validity, and the judicial system being heavily influenced by this. Taylor believed that the United States had an opportunity to establish an ideal political system due to the lack of native traditions that could hinder its creation, allowing for a system of self-governance. He strongly believed in natural rights—interdependent rights that, if infringed, diminish the value of the remaining ones—and that these rights should be outside of government control. He argued that the \"state of nature\" allowed the strong and cunning to thrive, but in a civilized society, this must not be the case.\n\nTo achieve this ideal society, Taylor believed that the government should be designed to account for the inherent goodness and evil in humans. He had a strict dualistic view of morality, stating that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He considered good principles to be those that protect private property, improve agriculture, and discourage capitalism. He believed that a government based on these principles would function fairly regardless of its administration, which he saw as inevitably self-interested. Taylor saw self-interest as a natural human trait, but considered it evil if it led to groups exploiting others. He believed a good government was essential to curb man's natural evil and must be carefully monitored to prevent the introduction of harmful principles.\n\nLike many of his contemporaries, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, favoring a highly limited federal government with powers explicitly stated in the document. He recognized that an expansive federal government could be expensive and potentially tyrannical, but he also warned that a literal, uninterpreted approach could become corrupt. He viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, there was a sharp decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project, which was quite concerning. The exact reason for this drop is unclear. The onset of winter in a New England campus likely contributed to a decrease in bicycle and foot commuters. Additionally, December is the end of the fall semester, a time when students and faculty are preoccupied with final tasks like completing schoolwork and grading. This could have led to commuter log submissions being overlooked. Furthermore, the holiday season brings a month-long break for students and faculty, reducing the need for campus visits. The project resumed in late January, which may have contributed to the low February submissions. It's also possible that the initial enthusiasm for the project naturally faded. To counteract this, we hosted the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which boosted log submissions. However, maintaining momentum was challenging due to both a natural decrease in engagement and the impact of holiday and semester breaks on higher education. Another challenge was the deep cultural preference for driving cars, which necessitates incentives for alternative commuting methods. We offered gift certificates as incentives, but it would have been interesting to see if more substantial prizes like bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars would have increased participation. The value of the prizes remained consistent throughout the project, but increasing them over time could have potentially boosted engagement. The gift cards were sufficient initially, but announcing more attractive prizes later in the project might have helped to prevent the decrease in participation seen in December and January.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of security that aims to mirror an index, commodity, or a collection of assets like an index fund but trades like a stock on exchanges. It offers diversification like an index fund and the advantages of owning individual stocks, such as the ability to short sell, use margin, and buy in any quantity, even as little as one share. While ETFs boast these features, they carry commission fees for each trade, similar to stock transactions. ETFs also have a wide range of options available. Despite these advantages, it's essential for investors to assess if these benefits are genuine and to what extent.\n\nFor our analysis, we'll examine the ETF IHF and compare it with its top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets, to determine if owning a single ETF can approximate the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of those ten stocks. We'll also evaluate if there are better configurations of the same stocks that could yield a superior risk/reward ratio or return.\n\nTo simplify our evaluation, we'll consider only the top ten holdings. We'll use the current percentage of assets, adjusted to 100%, to calculate the contributions of each stock to the portfolio's Beta and return if the portfolio consisted solely of these ten stocks in the proportions set by the ETF's holdings. The results are presented in the chart below.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio made up of only the top 10 holdings offers a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase. Additionally, the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF's overall Beta. These findings suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower risk. However, it's possible that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different.\n\nTo determine if the portfolios are statistically different, we'll calculate and normalize the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks to compare their combined standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Dream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe's most highly regarded poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which is traced back by Mabbott to Virgil. Virgil used the term to refer to an island north of Britain, which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. While it's clear that Virgil used the term, there's a more contemporary source that should be credited. Poe had a keen interest in German authors, as evidenced by his familiarity with the works of Goethe. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" notes the similarity between Poe's and Goethe's poems, concluding that Poe was influenced by Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned writer of the poetic drama Faust, which was published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Goethe's death, 1832. Within Faust's second part, there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" This poem tells the story of a king whose wife's gift of a goblet leads to her death, causing him to drink heavily and cry, ultimately leading to his decision to end his life. This character and the description in \"Dream-Land\" share striking similarities, possibly reflecting Poe's own struggles with loss and alcohol. Faust was also adapted into a romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, less than a year before Poe used the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe references Thule twice in his collected works, once using the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land,\" serving as bookends to the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule as dark, lonely, and filled with the ghostly presence of dead friends, seen in a colorless, shaded world. This mirrors the state of the king in \"The King of Thule\" after his loss, as he too is lonely and has lost his will to rule or live, stepping into a shadowy realm. Goethe was a significant author whom Poe would have known due to his respect for Tennyson. Additionally, Poe would have been exposed to Goethe's work through the numerous reproductions following the original publication.",
            "In accordance with California law, could a customer who was hurt after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be compensated with punitive damages by demonstrating that the store manager acted with malice? The manager was informed twice about the spill and did not clean it for half an hour because he was having dinner. A judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages outright. To prove that such damages are justified, she must show that the defendant acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm and that the conduct was despicable. She can argue that the manager should have been aware of the potential harm and still failed to clean the spill, despite knowing that multiple customers had previously been injured in similar incidents. While her argument that the manager's actions were despicable may be less persuasive, the facts—six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 without proper action—support her claim. On October 13, 2009, an employee notified the manager about the spill, but he was on break and did not have time. Another employee reported the spill 15 minutes later, and he responded the same way. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, leading to a serious back injury. She is now suing for damages, and we are considering filing a motion to dismiss the punitive damages claim. Under California law, punitive damages can be awarded for a breach of non-contractual obligations if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Malice is defined as conduct that intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a willful and conscious disregard for others' rights. This is characterized as malicious when the defendant knows the probable dangerous consequences of their actions and deliberately fails to avoid them.",
            "Four years ago, I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. One of the main points of debate was whether Islam is a hostile religion. This question seems even more pertinent now, especially when considering the shift in public perception post-9/11. Initially, the media held a hostile stance towards Islam and extremists, but this has since evolved into an extreme form of tolerance for Islam in America. For instance, in 2001, it's doubtful that a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with known Muslim roots, would have been viable.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography intrigues me because it presents a character that contradicts historical accounts of his personality. Previously, I believed Muhammad compelled conversions and subdued tribes, forcing them to adopt Islam. However, the biography portrays him as a martyr, misunderstood and humble, with people gradually coming to see the truth in his teachings.\n\nMoreover, there are uncanny parallels between Jesus' teachings and Muhammad's miracles. For example, Muhammad is said to have multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men. This style of writing depicts Muhammad as a humble prophet, not requiring proof but simply living in truth and miracles. This approach, however, minimizes Jesus' life and miracles, suggesting a form of attribution by Muhammad.\n\nMany stories in the biography aim to validate 'witnesses' and self-conversions. However, these accounts often come from third-party perspectives, which diminishes their credibility. The narrative structure, with stories told through intermediaries, reduces the impact of the tales and makes them seem less genuine.\n\nWhat bothers me most is the attempt to portray Muhammad as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle man. Historical records contradict this depiction of Muhammad, and I question whether Muslims today are aware of the true history behind his rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs held by Jesus during his time were initially left behind in the evolution of Christian thought that followed. Over time, Christianity has drifted further and further from its origins. Today's world exhibits an increasing awareness and unprecedented progressive tendencies. Traditionalists, who resist any ideas beyond what they were taught, may not have enough influence to steer the whole. Christians will likely gain a deeper historical understanding in the future, leading to a desire to differentiate the doctrines added over time from Jesus' originalintentions. This reversal of Christian history, which could take decades or centuries, will involve stripping away layers of doctrine, akin to rewinding the clock, until only Jesus' original message remains. When this trend spreads through the United States and Europe, it will inspire a return to Jesus' teachings, leading to a stronger, more unified church institution. However, this reverse trend will result in reduced diversity among Christians, as different regions, denominations, and divisions become more similar. Throughout history, reversals have occurred, such as when Christians were persecuted by the Roman Empire before it became Christian. Similarly, the future's great reversal in Christianity will aim to return to the source, undoing diversity in the process. A key factor in this will be interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically, not literally. Since Jesus' lifetime, the progression of Christianity can be traced back to Judaism, with monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures at its core. When the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the Jewish population was divided into various groups, including Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "The Jungle illustrates that, at our core, humans are inherently selfish and concerned only with their own interests and comfort. People strive to improve their own lives without considering those beneath them. The factory owners and managers exemplify this, focusing solely on expanding their businesses at any cost. They disregard the environmental damage caused by their polluting factories and the suffering of their workers. According to Upton Sinclair, the \"line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" highlighting the devastation their actions unleashed. Sinclair portrays the owners' indifference to the harm caused by their factories' emissions and the animal waste from the pens at Packingtown. They also exploit their employees, prioritizing profits over workers' well-being, pushing them to work long hours and potentially lay them off without compensation or job assistance. In the era depicted, there were few laws protecting workers' safety or welfare, allowing managers and owners to operate with impunity, forcing workers to endure harsh conditions. The book implies that those who died in Packingtown were expected to accept their miserable lives without aid or advocacy. Workers had no recourse, as unions often exploited them for their own gain. The workers were so mistreated and trapped in this system that they were likened to slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\"",
            "Numerous writers employ various strategies to evoke specific feelings or attitudes in their readers regarding significant themes. Among these methods, F. Scott Fitzgerald employs several techniques in his novel \"The Great Gatsby.\" He often couples unusual adjective-noun pairs to create a particular atmosphere around a subject. Additionally, he imbues symbols with meaning and subsequently uses these symbols for the same purpose. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald assigns particular meanings to colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink, which he later employs to remind readers of feelings associated with important objects.\n\nFor instance, Fitzgerald associates the colors white and gray with uniformity, where white connotes a higher class and gray signifies age and dullness. He establishes this association early in the novel through frequent references to both colors. Characters like Daisy, Jordan, and Nick are often described as wearing white, while Tom is seen in a white shirt when he meets Myrtle. Even minor details like Nick's party attire and the apartment of Catherine, which is described as a slice of a white cake, emphasize this uniformity. Unimportant subjects are also depicted with these colors: Nick's workplace is described as \"white chasms,\" and the names on his party guest list are \"gray names.\" Moreover, Fitzgerald uses these colors to depict everyday objects and people, further reinforcing their significance.\n\nAfter building up these color associations, Fitzgerald employs them to signify indifference or uniformity. This technique first applies to Daisy. After an extended period without notable references to these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster,\" leading readers to perceive her as less of a character and more of a uniform addition that Gatsby desires. This approach is reiterated when Daisy is described as having a \"gray haze of fur collar\" and again in a white dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter, further emphasizing her role as a uniform object of desire.",
            "San Diego County is highly fertile due to its warm, sunny climate. Common crops grown here include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic, community-supported agriculture in the San Diego region is substantial, with many local groups maintaining lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Numerous organic farms offer tours of their operations and recreational activities such as hiking and birdwatching. This type of operation allows landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitat and providing educational opportunities. While organic farming can fill a profitable niche market and increase local biodiversity, it also comes with higher costs due to the need for intensive labor and management, and lower scale efficiency compared to conventional farming. Practices beneficial to wildlife, like planting cover crops or strategic grazing rotation, may also increase labor costs. Therefore, the landowner in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expert advice to balance profits and environmental conservation. The chosen parcel is located in unincorporated San Diego County, next to the Cleveland National Forest, and is part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion within the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This region is home to over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher. This area has a long history of human habitation, initially by Native Americans, and later by cattle ranchers. The land was part of an original homestead patent and likely used for grazing and/or wood production. The owner of the property researched government programs to find cost mitigation options for a small farmer and used an existing organic farm in the same area as a model.",
            "The impact of culture is substantial in any negotiation. Culture is not merely what it is, but also what it is not and what it represents. It is not monolithic or uniform, and broad generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are oversimplifications. While understanding cultural norms is useful, a successful negotiator should focus on how a culture's values and attitudes influence negotiations. When dealing with a foreign culture, one tends to relate it to their own, leading to inevitable comparisons. To comprehend a foreign culture or mindset, one might study its history and recognize its biases. Instead of criticizing or attempting to alter a culture, it's essential to accept it as it is and operate within its parameters, especially when in a weaker negotiating position or in a foreign setting. Culture extends beyond national boundaries, as companies within a nation often develop their own distinct cultures. Corporate cultures can manifest in dress codes, communication styles, hiring practices, and employee philanthropy policies. Even within the same society, there can be significant diversity in corporate culture, as seen in the variations between American companies. Some cultures present as less stratified but may still harbor deep differences. Values are crucial as they explain the \"why\" behind a culture's behavior. If saving face or harmony is valued, a negotiator will avoid public embarrassment to secure a deal. A negotiator should also learn about their opponent's personal background to enhance the negotiation's effectiveness.",
            "\"The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This phrase is first found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and it serves as the starting point for St. Anselm's argument for God's existence. Notably, it also reflects the stance of the other thinker we'll discuss, Thomas Aquinas. Both authors argue for the same God, so to compare their arguments, we'll assume they both believe in the God of the Bible. This assumption allows us to focus on their arguments specifically for this God, as any other concept of God wouldn't be relevant to their respective arguments. While both present valid points, neither truly offers a comprehensive basis for belief in God.\n\nTo begin our analysis, let's examine St. Anselm's main argument. Anselm posits that understanding God comes through faith, with the proof of God's existence residing within our own minds. He argues that since God is present in our understanding, we can't imagine God's nonexistence. Although his phrasing can be dense, the core idea is that God's existence is evident in our inherent knowledge. This concept aligns with Christian faith's acceptance of truths that lack empirical evidence.\n\nThis differs from St. Thomas Aquinas' approach. Aquinas asserts that God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, without relying on faith. This perspective would be advantageous for evangelism, as it would enable converting people through logic alone. Aquinas presents five logical arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each, he demonstrates that God's existence is logically necessary, akin to knowing the features of a missing puzzle piece without seeing it.",
            "Around 2500 years ago, a future figure, eventually known as the Buddha, was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned worldly life and became enlightened, founding Buddhism. The most traditional form of this religion is called Theravada Buddhism. Over its 2500-year history, it has evolved significantly, as seen in the annual water-cutting ceremony observed in Sri Lanka, though Buddha himself did not teach such rituals. These changes span from cultural traditions to core beliefs. Theravada Buddhism, from both monastic and lay perspectives, has adapted its teachings due to various internal and external influences, some hostile and others benign.\n\nFirst, it's crucial to understand the fundamental tenets of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists take refuge in the Three Jewels—the Buddha, the Dhamma (Buddhist teachings), and the Sangha (community of monks). The Dhamma includes the Tripitaka, comprising the Sutta Pitaka (scriptures), Vinaya Pitaka (rules of conduct), and Abhidhamma Pitaka (metaphysical concepts). Key concepts include Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these ideas is essential for escaping Sansara (the cycle of death and rebirth) and overcoming craving, hatred, and delusion. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for laypeople (five precepts: non-killing, honesty, non-stealing, chastity, and abstinence from intoxicants) and monks, with the most fundamental doctrine being the Four Noble Truths: life is suffering, attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome, and the path to overcoming suffering involves the Eightfold Path.",
            "The United States and Mexico once had a long-standing rivalry that lasted from 1836 to 1893, a rivalry marked by the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), where the U.S. defeated Mexico and gained Texas and the American Southwest. This conflict was one of many clashes between the two nations that subsided before World War I. The rivalry stemmed from disagreements over religion, culture, and material interests, much like other nations that share a border. David M. Pletcher (1977) noted that only Mexico and Cuba have had enduring issues with the U.S., due to their geographical proximity. The religious differences between the nations, rooted in the historical tension between the English and Spanish, contributed to this rivalry. According to Diehl and Goerts (2000), 17 disputes occurred during this period, primarily territorial in nature, such as Mexican raids into U.S. territory and border issues. Schmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry began to ease as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the U.S. and ended with a shift in U.S. ambitions from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico during the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became unexpectedly disabled by a previously unknown illness. At the time, I was a nurse, having chosen this profession to ensure my own safety and security, as I hadn't experienced them in my childhood. The phrase, \"You'll always have a job; people always get sick,\" constantly reinforced this decision, even though my dream was initially to be a scientist or journalist. Despite being 46, single, and with no significant savings or work capacity due to my disability, I have relied on Social Security Disability for the past 15 years. My life now is a constant struggle, and nothing feels secure. However, without the support of my family and a few friends, I wouldn't have made it this far. When facing real crises, it becomes clear that relying solely on oneself is not enough.\n\nLife always presents emergencies, big and small, and no amount of preparation can guarantee overcoming them alone. I strongly believe that we should reduce our reliance on large government systems and encourage Americans to regain trust in each other, helping one another and seeking assistance. The resilience of our forefathers was not built on rugged individualism but on compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources. Pioneers didn't cross the Rockies alone; they traveled in wagon trains.\n\nWhile I advocate being prepared for emergencies with supplies like a disaster kit, first aid, and food storage, I also stress the importance of getting to know and supporting your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the way they do? Are there limitations that influence the path of evolutionary change? Although D’Arcy Thompson noted in 1917 that \"Even now the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" this sentiment remains true today. Recent advancements have applied mathematical modeling to various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can uncover the mechanisms driving the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental changes. By analyzing X-radiographic images of Prunum species, we identified quantitative parameters for modeling hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies using the CerioShell software (Stone, 1995). We generated models of hypothetical shell morphologies to understand the boundaries of possible morphological changes in Prunum, integrating these with experimental and descriptive studies to better comprehend macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a tube that evolves over time through 360 degrees of space. These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The pace at which whorls enlarge varies, and a continuous line separates each whorl, referred to as a suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the last one, called the body whorl. The spire consists of all whorls except the last. The top of the spire is called the apex, and the bottom is the base. The animal emerges through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be examined in apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves first viewing the shell from the apical perspective and then locating the first suture. A line is drawn to divide the shell into two parts, and whorls are counted from this line, estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that move through time and space as the animal grows its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced using the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture, along with the horizontal and vertical radii. This trajectory can be both graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is established, parameters can be adjusted to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained relatively unchanged over the past decade. Despite the nation's progress towards many Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, improvements in child and maternal health are far from what's needed to meet the 2015 targets. The underlying causes of these shortfalls point to the need to bolster Indonesia's healthcare system rather than solely focusing on specific interventions.\n\nIn terms of healthcare delivery, Indonesia has seen an increase in births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% now meeting this target. However, this figure includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot provide medical interventions during complications, leading to a high number of maternal deaths from hemorrhage. Moreover, there has been a decrease in the proportion of diarrhea cases in children under five treated by a healthcare professional. Postnatal care data is incomplete, but it's evident that this is also an area of concern with low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain low at about 4%, and there's a notable disparity between urban (7%) and rural (2%) rates, indicating inequitable healthcare access across the country, with most services concentrated in urban areas. Additionally, there's a 27% gap in healthcare service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, suggesting that the poor struggle more to access services due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nIn considering how to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is how to most effectively address the lack of healthcare services. Should Indonesia develop targeted programs or strengthen the overall healthcare system, including pre- and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children? While targeted programmatic approaches have clear, manageable objectives and can generate faster results, there are drawbacks to consider. Heavy investment in one area can divert funding and human resources from others, leading to duplication of services and uncoordinated efforts.",
            "Victorian literature is renowned for its meticulous attention to detail and focus on aristocratic themes. Two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which stand out due to their use of mystery and the unusual, qualities uncommon in the era's literature. These elements enrich the characters' development by revealing their motivations and feelings. For instance, in Dickens' Oliver Twist, dream sequences are employed to delve into Oliver's psyche, providing insights into his inner turmoil and experiences. The scene where Oliver relives the shooting in Chapter 28 is a prime example, illustrating his lack of control over the situation and the enduring trauma it causes. Oliver's hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit underscore his powerlessness, and the shooting serves as a catalyst for his sense of defeat, suggesting that external forces, perhaps the influence of characters like Fagin, are shaping his despair and limiting his ability to react.\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.”",
            "A few years back, I was a tutor in an after-school program for elementary-aged students. I made efforts to assist them in subjects they were struggling with, particularly in English and reading. I was asked by one instructor to help a boy named Adrian, who was having difficulty reading. I noticed something unusual about Adrian's case; he could pronounce some letters correctly, while others were a mystery. Adrian was of Latino descent, and though he spoke English perfectly, his reading comprehension was problematic. One day, when his mother visited, she couldn't speak English, only Spanish. With my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate, and it became clear that Adrian's issue was not with reading itself, but with the English alphabet and its pronunciations. While I'm unsure if this realization helped Adrian, I hope he's doing better now. I share this story to highlight language barriers in schools, especially in California, and to illustrate that even apparent English proficiency doesn't guarantee reading comprehension. This problem is evident to all, and solutions can be complex. Adrian's case showed that targeted tutoring in English reading helped, but for children with minimal English proficiency, a combination of various approaches is essential. The dual language system is beneficial for all children, not just those whose first language is Spanish. It has been found to improve academic performance, but the idea often faces resistance due to fears of resource waste. Implementing such programs on a larger scale could benefit all students. To achieve this, bilingual aids or tutors could be employed without requiring all teachers to be bilingual.",
            "Throughout our lives, many of us are taught that there is something greater than ourselves, something we can't fully understand. Some of us learn about it in religious settings, others seek it within themselves, while some of us wholeheartedly embrace the beliefs passed down to us by our parents. Conversely, there are those who reject these ideas, believing that there is nothing beyond our personal experiences. We may adopt one belief system only to later change our minds and embrace another. Regardless of the path we choose, we define a part of our identity through our unique spiritual views. We search for a beacon of light to guide us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\nMy father's favorite bird, he said, was the cardinal. We sat on the front porch, listening to the rain batter the tin roof as we smoked. The gutters channeled the rain, drenching the plants around the porch. He stared into the rain, his gaze split between searching and reminiscing. He had lost weight, and his clothes hung loosely on him. His hair was thinner, and he avoided eye contact. I felt alone, afraid, and unable to discuss how much I would miss him with him. I hugged him, pulled my chair closer, and joined him in watching the rain fall in the June twilight.\n\nMy father passed away in December that same year, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation prolonged his suffering rather than easing it, but kept him alive a few extra months beyond the doctors' projections. I couldn't comprehend the value in prolonging his suffering. If God existed, I thought, he must have stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI hadn't wanted to witness my father's passing. So, I chose not to. I didn't want to see the creator of my life end. I preferred to remember him by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than anyone else did, and I knew he wouldn't want me to watch him die. I curled up in my bed for three days, waiting for the news, but no one even called me.",
            "The classic \"Gothic Novel,\" a term coined by Ian Watt, is essentially an oxymoron, combining \"old\" and \"new\" elements. It has been both criticized and celebrated, praised for its 'terrible sublime' effect (Burke). Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the first Gothic novel, blended medieval and modern romantic ideas to establish the Gothic genre. Walpole used old theatrical elements and new mimicry of nature in modern novels to create his \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre frequently references medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. When Walpole published The Castle of Otranto, the term \"gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and periods, often viewed as archaic or unsophisticated compared to modern advancements. The fusion of the theatrical Gothic elements with the novel's new format, which offered readers an intimate view of characters' psychologies, ensured the genre's longevity and timeless appeal. Even when removed from its original context, a reader can still find it both outdated and fresh.\n\nOne prominent theme in Gothic novels is the concept of chivalry. The Castle of Otranto retains and transforms the medieval idea of chivalry, the training of a proper knight. Chivalry is significant to Gothic writers because it represents the ideal of a brave, honorable, and competent knight, and the perceived absence of those qualities in contemporary society. By incorporating chivalric ideas and practices, Gothic novels idealize and romanticize the past, hinting at the evolution towards Romanticism, and strive to improve the present. Walpole, writing during a politically tumultuous time, may have felt that the moral integrity and inherent goodness of the Gothic era had been lost in modern society. This is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies chivalric traits. Before meeting Frederic, he is described as a prince, having suffered tragedy and being presumed killed by infidels. His character, with its exaggerated chivalric imagery, exemplifies the Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the flow of activities that move goods from the point of customer order through to raw materials sourcing, production, and distribution to the customer. The term was coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described it as the process of planning, implementing, and overseeing the supply chain to meet customer needs swiftly and efficiently. Key components of supply chain management include production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nThe first step in the supply chain process is production. This is the cornerstone of the entire supply chain. Production planning involves determining when, where, how, and why goods will be produced. To make informed decisions, managers must understand customer demands. Market analysis is crucial for determining customer needs. Once market demands are understood, managers can decide which products to produce and in what quantities. The next step is choosing the most optimal location for production based on volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. After selecting a location, managers focus on scheduling workloads and equipment maintenance. Production is a critical stage in the supply chain, and meticulous planning is essential to avoid costly delays and inefficiencies.\n\nThe second key element in supply chain management is supply. Supply involves strategic decisions to determine the core capabilities of a facility and to establish partnerships for outsourcing. A company may have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with its own set of equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must choose the division best suited for each product process. Outsourcing work to other companies can enhance flexibility and reduce costs while maintaining quality. The primary goal of outsourcing is to achieve velocity, which refers to the ability to provide quality and flexibility while controlling or maintaining low costs.",
            "Hitler is alive in Myanmar, the sign reads.\n\nEllen Page, the star of Juno, stands alone at a street corner, holding a piece of cardboard with a disturbing message written on it in Sharpie. Myanmar, a Southeast Asian nation, is governed by a dictatorial military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup d'état. In 2007, public protests led by monks began, marking the first such unrest in a decade. Known as the Saffron Revolution, these protests initially saw monks gathering peacefully, but later escalated into violence between the monks and the military, with the military invading monasteries and foreign journalists being arrested and killed. While the official death count is 13, a defector from the army claimed many more people were killed. This is not an isolated incident; governments' suppression of dissent is as old as civilization itself. Examples include Roman emperors claiming divine right to rule, Japanese emperors being considered divine, and the current U.S. President having weekly calls with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide.\n\nFamous instances include the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, where students, intellectuals, and labor activists gathered to protest the government's authoritarian rule, with death tolls ranging from hundreds to thousands. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, involving Hutu militia groups and the Rwandan government systematically killing Tutsis and political moderates, is another tragic example. Hitler's 'Third Reich' saw the systematic murder of Jewish people in multiple countries.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence in jazz is largely owed to his long-lasting career and his innovative abilities to lead his orchestra. Although Ellington's piano presence is often subtle in many of his compositions, he excelled as a composer in creating intricate and detailed pieces that highlighted the individual talents of his band members. Ellington established a framework that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also crafting tightly arranged pieces that showcased each musician's unique style. This approach not only emphasized the overall tone of the orchestra but also enabled him to produce some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's sound and innovation, particularly in \"Creole Love Call,\" where he pioneered the use of the voice as a jazz instrument. This early piece demonstrates Ellington's ability to add texture and color without lyrics and his skill in complementing his soloists' styles. \"Creole Love Call\" consists of six choruses, each showcasing different musical elements and textures:\n\n- Chorus 1: A call and response between voice and reeds, starting with a smooth, melodic voice that transitions to a rougher sound.\n- Chorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that builds upon the basic melody, focusing on extended blue notes.\n- Chorus 3: A high-register clarinet solo backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n- Chorus 4: The full band mimics the first chorus with a call and response by brass and reed sections.\n- Chorus 5: The climactic chorus, with reeds initiating the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from brass and rhythm sections.\n- Chorus 6: A return to the initial structure, with call and response between voice and reeds, this time featuring the \"growl\" technique in the vocal solo.\n- Tag: A vocal run and a dissonant trombone solo end the piece.\n\nEllington's use of the voice to add tonal depth in \"Creole Love Call\" exemplifies a recurring stylistic trait in his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington combines his orchestration skills with his ear for tone color. Here, a call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing marries the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental qualities of Cox's voice to produce a rich and complementary sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further extends these concepts, with Ellington utilizing Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton on muted trombone to great effect in introducing the melody.",
            "From a young age, she felt a persistent craving that remained unfulfilled. This longing began when she was 14, during the earliest stages of her teenage years, and continued into her 17th year. Initially, she thought she wanted something tangible, but over time, her interest shifted to a desire for a romantic connection. Despite many boys being drawn to her and attempting to court her, she felt no genuine attraction. This conundrum puzzled her greatly, but she continued to question it, although she hadn't yet found a satisfactory explanation. She led a peaceful life with her parents, who were calm and understanding, apart from occasional disagreements about her independent nature. Her vibrant and fun personality complemented her kindness, making her well-liked.\n\nHowever, one day, her peaceful routine was disrupted. Hearing her mother scream from the kitchen, she rushed in to find her mother on the ground, in pain. Her mother instructed her to take her to the hospital. With her mother's directions, she carried her to the car and drove her to the hospital. The hospital's antiseptic and sickly smells were overshadowed by her mother's condition. She quickly sought help from the doctors, who rushed to assist her mother, who had fallen from a stepladder while trying to reach a high cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that sticking to a Mediterranean Diet (Med diet), indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean\" diet score, is linked to a lower risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related deaths. The \"alternate Mediterranean\" diet is a modified Mediterranean diet, characterized by higher consumption of plant-based foods (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (instead of saturated fats), and fish, with lower intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that adherence to the Med diet is inversely associated with total and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, and an intervention trial found the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in overweight individuals. However, these prior studies did not concentrate on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. Six times between 1984 and 2004, authors calculated an aMed diet score from self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to estimate nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of participants maintained involvement throughout the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified by reviewing medical or hospital records, autopsy reports, or death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone use were calculated for each FFQ. Beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation for each individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from the previous two years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that might distort results) by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the connection between the aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal cases of CHD and stroke.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years, 2391 new CHD cases, 1763 new stroke cases, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combined CHD and strokes) were identified. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a severe financial crisis. Unemployment surged, the housing market collapsed, and many major American corporations were left in shambles. This recession continues today, prompting us to question: What caused this crisis, and how can we prevent it in the future? Essentially, the crisis stemmed from greedy and naive political decisions that pressured banks and firms to offer sub-prime loans despite the financial system's immaturity and inadequacy. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were urged to back and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted, banks lacked adequate capital reserves, causing the chaos to spread to the repackaged mortgages they sold and, ultimately, to the broader economy.\n\nThe financial crisis can be traced back to 1999, during Bill Clinton's presidency, as he sought to secure a second term. To boost his popularity, the Clinton administration loosened lending restrictions, paving the way for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest home mortgage underwriter, has faced increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income individuals and from shareholders to maintain its remarkable profit growth.\" Holmes accurately predicted the consequences: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, potentially requiring a government rescue similar to the one offered to the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As mentioned earlier, and as Holmes foretold, imprudent lending would inevitably lead to an economic meltdown.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the complex mortgage structures used in the years leading up to the crisis. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were heavily used, further entangling various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to excessive leverage among U.S. households and financial markets, making them extremely sensitive to even minor price changes.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities suffered significant losses. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA's GDP. In the aftermath, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was liquidated, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become heavily regulated commercial banks. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Exposition, that moment in your narrative where you take flight with your writing skills, captivating your audience with compelling prose, or that part where your readers lose focus and either nod off or hit the back button while grumbling about your writing. Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her screen when she encounters excessive information, not even in an amusing way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy dear readers are probably already familiar with the writing advice, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin often falls into the trap of writing long passages where nothing significant happens, or even worse, too much. Exposition is that little voice in your head whispering to get the background out of the way to move on to the main events (not to be confused with the voice urging you to reveal every detail of your characters' histories).\n\nExposition involves conveying what happened to your audience, usually in straightforward language. In film, this occurs when one character provides a lengthy summary of information, like the monologue in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, the author is the one doing the telling.\n\nLet's take an example. While reading a story, you discover that the heroine met her love at a certain place and time, they wed in a grand manner, and her husband was slain in front of her. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to take up two pages, during which they only have two lines of dialogue each. You would expect the author to delve into the husband's character, revealing his deep love for her through his words and actions, and show how his presence enriched her life. A proper introduction to his character would allow you to become emotionally invested in his fate and gain insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, their bond's depth, clues about her thoughts and beliefs as reflected through his eyes, and so on. You would mourn his death with her, growing more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you need to provide substance to the simple storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you have to offer that substance. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, presses on*) Sometimes it's tempting to rush past certain details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and know he was once in the Air Force, now manages a night shift at a gas station, has been married twice, has no children, enjoys fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I viewed two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, a live broadcast on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011), covered a report about a man named Shad Hostettler in Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. The name of the victim was not mentioned, but Hostettler's mugshot was shown, portraying him as \"pure evil.\" The story was brief, lasting only two minutes, and provided limited details—he was arrested after stabbing her multiple times. I felt the time devoted to this story was sufficient. The second story concerned an early-morning shooting of Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old, in the Sharon Woods area. Buyers was critically injured, and no arrests were made. The SWAT team was investigating. This story seemed brief; I suspect this was due to the racial dynamics, as I've noticed that media coverage often differs when minorities are crime victims. The story about a Med-Flight helicopter with a .22 caliber rifle bullet hole was next, with Crime-Stoppers offering a $5,000 reward for the shooter's arrest. Another story addressed thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures ranging from mid- to low-eighties, presented as a teaser to keep viewers interested. A robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus was also covered, involving a dark-skinned black man in a hoodie. The man was described as six feet tall and 150 pounds, with more attention given to his race and skin color than usual. The final story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin sentenced to 300 months (or 25 years) for allegedly distributing large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. His Hispanic heritage was mentioned, but it wasn't clear why it was relevant to the story.",
            "There exists a deep connection between brothers, an unshakable, immutable bond. Embedded within this bond are numerous emotions: affection, vanity, envy, and harshness, among others. Brothers comprehend one another, more so than any other bond, and can only see themselves mirrored in their brother's eyes. It is in times of greatest peril that the essence of this bond is revealed, whether for good or ill. When these emotions are laid bare, they exact a heavy toll. A part of grasping the feelings born of this fraternal tie involves coping with the repercussions they bring. When one can gaze into their brother's eyes and see their own reflection, they perceive themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. Their actions and the consequences of those actions unveil their genuine character. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme and the accompanying tumultuous emotions. Across a richly described landscape, these two boys embark on a doomed expedition. Bitter disappointment and intense pride collide in the climactic scene, and only one brother survives. The theme is conveyed through the direct portrayal of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s viewpoint, which communicates the protagonist's complex feelings and their perspective on the world, both of which greatly influence his actions.\n\tThe protagonist's actions can be distilled into one dominant emotion: pride. From their first outing together to their final, fateful journey, the protagonist harbors resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle. He had wished for a brother to teach life skills like holding his breath, running, jumping, or climbing vines in Old Woman Swamp. He wanted a brother to compete with in races to Horsehead Landing and to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn. However, Doodle's severe heart condition made these dreams nearly impossible. The young protagonist, filled with wild fantasies, was crushed to realize these goals were unattainable. Even so, he harbored some anger towards the small child, recalling a moment when he considered suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child could entertain such a thought? However, his heart softened when Doodle smiled at him. This simple act sparked hope within him, revealing that his conviction to harm was likely not strong. Deep down, he possessed an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "The brain is a complex, inventive information-processing organ. As technology has evolved from rudimentary to advanced, so have the metaphors used to describe it. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of parchment, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you delve into brain studies, bear in mind that these metaphors are limited and can lead to faulty conclusions.\nInformation processing begins with input from your senses, which convert physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or light particles into electrical signals. The sensory data is repeatedly processed by the brain through both hierarchical and feedback processes. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, hierarchical processing combines simple data like color, orientation, and object borders to identify it as a box. Feedback processing can then help you recognize it more quickly as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in white.\nOnce information is processed, an attention mechanism decides its importance and which cognitive processes should access it. For example, while your brain scans every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, a healthy attention mechanism filters them out so you don't notice each one individually. However, you might pick out your name even in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results are repeatedly influenced by attention.\nTo process information, the brain must first store it. There are various types of memory, such as sensory, working, and long-term. Information is initially encoded based on the type of stimulus. For instance, verbal input can be encoded as visual, auditory, or semantic. Once stored, information must be kept, with working memory, which holds data for about 20 seconds, being maintained by a looping electrical signal through specific neurons. Long-term memory storage is hypothesized to involve certain proteins.\nThere are various theories on how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing from different fields like psychology, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented as nodes, with nodes linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might link to \"table,\" which can link to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley critiques the impending danger of both technological advancements and the capitalist system that upholds them through the creation of a dystopian society in his novel Brave New World. The citizens of this society prioritize community over individuality and are conditioned from birth to seek immediate happiness above all else. People are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to a singular ideology as dictated by the World Controller. Analyzing the work through a Marxist lens, one finds Huxley’s underlying concerns about the development of these systems. Terms like homogeneity and reification are frequently used to suggest that Huxley’s novel is a critique of the flaws in the emerging economy of his time.\n\nCapitalism is satirized through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, which keeps the common people unaware of their true economic relations. Instead, they are focused on their own gain, a result of ideological control over the proletariat and common laborers, as seen in the conditioning of Brave New World’s citizens. The lower classes, such as Delta and Gamma, have no independent will; instead, hypnopædia encourages consumption and indulgence. The World Controller manipulates this, and the concept of hegemony, where one group dominates another, is evident. The lower classes are unaware of this manipulation, “buying into” the ideology that supports capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes, such as Alphas and Betas, also accept their place, with few exceptions like Bernard. The interactions between social classes indicate the perceived oppression of capitalism. Relationships between individuals are superficial, as seen in characters’ comments focusing on physical appearance and encounters. The citizens’ complacency with their social status suggests the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, with Marxist thought on the proletariat being reinforced, as they are made to believe in their superiority through continued consumption and obedience.",
            "I've been a University Park student for approximately two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Navigating around campus can be challenging for many students, including myself. My first year, I stayed in an East Halls dorm, the easternmost residential area on campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. It could take up to 25 minutes to walk from my dorm to classes in distant locations like the Willard Building, especially when it's bad weather, which is common in State College. An older alumni told me that in the past, East Halls was separated from the main campus by vast, underutilized lands. Now, those spaces have been developed into sports fields, new structures like the Creamery and health services building, and apartments, as the campus continues to grow. This expansion has made movement around campus increasingly difficult.\n\nThe solution to this mobility issue lies in cycling, but it's not effective unless students use bicycles and the campus is designed to accommodate them. My friend, who recently restarted cycling after years of hiatus, agreed that bikes are the best way to get around campus. Apart from being good for health, cycling is also the most efficient mode of transport. A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of exercise can take you 30 miles or more. I currently live off-campus, equidistant from the center as some dorms. The best decision I've made this year was to buy a bike. Usually, it takes me 25 minutes to walk to my classes in Thomas building. Biking can reduce this time to 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. However, Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas, isn't always easy to bike on. While walking also has its advantages, I lack the time due to my busy schedule. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only option, adding an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily routine, which amounts to over two and a half hours each week, not to mention the time spent walking to other classes, appointments, and more."
