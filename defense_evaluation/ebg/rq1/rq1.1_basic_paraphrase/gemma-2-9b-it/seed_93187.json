            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "This paper examines the biological and sociocultural factors contributing to insomnia. The biological model emphasizes the role of genetics and physiological factors in sleep, while the sociocultural model considers environmental influences such as race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The paper reviews research studies related to both models, analyzing their findings, strengths, and weaknesses to better understand insomnia.\n\nSleep disorders are categorized as primary, secondary to mental disorders, or secondary to medical conditions or substance use. Primary sleep disorders include dyssomnias (e.g., insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep disorders) and parasomnias (e.g., nightmare disorder, sleep terror disorder, sleepwalking disorder). Secondary sleep disorders arise from mental health conditions (Axis I or Axis II disorders) or medical issues. This review focuses primarily on insomnia and primary sleep disorders, exploring their connections to biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders centers on genetic predispositions and physiological mechanisms. Research on orexin neurons in the hypothalamus, which regulate sleep and wakefulness, suggests a link between the GABAB receptor and sleep regulation. Studies in mice have shown that activating the GABAB receptor promotes sleep, while inhibiting it reduces anxiety and induces sleep. These findings suggest a potential genetic basis for sleep disorders, where variations in the GABAB receptor could contribute to sleep problems. The sociocultural implications of this research highlight the interplay between genetics and environment, where inherited variations in the GABAB receptor could influence sleep patterns and potentially affect individuals' academic, professional, and daily functioning.",
            "This paper explores three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with a concise definition of the disorder. Next, it delves into the diagnosis of CAPD, outlining common indicators or \"red flags.\" Finally, the paper concludes by offering strategies that teachers in inclusive classroom settings can employ to support students with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to the brain's ability to effectively process auditory information.  While individuals with CAPD can hear normally, their brains struggle to translate and interpret sounds, making it difficult to distinguish words, separate conversations from background noise, or understand subtle changes in speech.\n\nThe origins of CAPD research can be traced back to the mid-1950s, initially termed \"auditory imperception.\"  Since then, researchers have developed tests and models to better understand the neurological basis of CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways, including difficulty localizing sounds, discriminating between similar sounds, recognizing sound patterns, understanding changes in speech tone, blocking out background noise, synthesizing auditory information, and determining the sequence of sounds.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a comprehensive assessment that combines observation of listening behaviors and standardized tests of auditory function.  These assessments are typically conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, or psychologists. While there is no single definitive test for CAPD, common methods include presenting patients with multiple sounds simultaneously and asking them to identify specific targets.",
            "Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\" explores the complexities of disguise and deception. While acknowledging that disguise can be effective for prolonged deceit, the play ultimately suggests that abandoning a fabricated identity is crucial for self-preservation, as clinging to it risks losing one's true self. However, ending a deception can lead to alienation from others, as some may react negatively to being tricked.\n\nThe play particularly examines the challenges of gender role reversal through disguise. A central question arises: why would someone choose to adopt the identity of the opposite gender? In Viola's case, this decision stems from self-protection in an unfamiliar land.  \n\nAlthough her disguise provides safety, it isolates her from female companionship and creates a complex web of mistaken identities and emotions. Olivia, believing Viola to be male (Cesario), falls in love with her, while Viola herself develops suppressed feelings for Orsino. This situation highlights how deception can inadvertently expose hidden desires and complexities within characters.\n\nWhile Olivia's attraction to Cesario might initially seem progressive, it could also be interpreted as a satirical commentary on societal norms and superficial judgments. Her swift shift of affection from Cesario to Sebastian, followed by her acceptance of Viola as a sister, underscores this point.",
            "German colonialism is often remembered for its brutality, particularly the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa. However, this simplistic view overlooks the diversity of German colonial policies and practices across its vast empire.  Education, for instance, varied greatly. When Britain took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a significant number of educated Africans. Similarly, German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies received praise from contemporaries. \n\nIn stark contrast, South West Africa (present-day Namibia) saw a different approach. Unlike East Africa, where the government actively established schools and promoted education for natives, South West Africa's education was largely left to missionary societies with minimal government support. The German government, however, heavily invested in educating Europeans, establishing state schools and providing substantial backing to missionary institutions. These policies had a lasting impact on South West Africa, even after German rule ended. While other German colonies boasted literate and educated African populations, South West Africa saw the majority of its people remain uneducated and illiterate. This disparity can be attributed to a complex interplay of social, political, and economic factors, which this paper aims to explore in detail, focusing particularly on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nExisting research on education in the German colonial empire, primarily in German from the early 20th century, often focuses on describing the features of each colony's educational system. Later English-language works have expanded this discourse with comparative studies and deeper analyses of specific aspects of education, highlighting significant differences across colonies. Notably, Cohen's study comparing education in South West Africa and East Africa offers a valuable framework for understanding the factors behind their contrasting educational landscapes. Cohen argues that the substantial settler population in South West Africa played a key role in shaping the colony's unique educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa, with its  temperate climate (despite its arid deserts), attracted a relatively large European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided there, significantly more than the 5,336 in East Africa, the colony with the second-largest settler population.",
            "The vast and ever-expanding landscape of popular music has seen a proliferation of genres over the past century, making it nearly impossible to list them all comprehensively. Each genre, from rap and rock to country and jazz, has spawned numerous subgenres, creating a complex and interconnected web of musical styles. Among these, heavy metal rock has emerged as one of the most diverse and expressive genres in the past 40 years. Its emotional range, often leaning towards the darker aspects of the human experience, and its remarkable adaptability, which has led to countless subgenres and sub-subgenres, contribute to its incredible diversity.\n\nThe sheer number of heavy metal niches today makes it challenging to define precisely what constitutes heavy metal. It has absorbed influences from various genres, yet its origins remain crucial to understanding its evolution. To truly grasp the multifaceted world of metal music, one must first delve into the origins of the metal movement itself, recognizing its unique characteristics and cultural impact.\n\nMetal, in essence, is a movement defined by its intensity and embrace of the darker aspects of human experience. It often features amplified volume, powerful bass lines, and a theatricality that sets it apart. Technical proficiency is highly valued in metal bands, showcasing their mastery of their instruments. \n\nThe movement has also been significantly influenced by drug culture, particularly the psychedelic boom of the mid-1970s. This era saw artists experimenting with drugs, resulting in music that explored unconventional and often unsettling themes. Metal's embrace of darkness and visceral emotions was a departure from the prevailing trends in popular music, offering a new perspective on the spectrum of human emotions. Later generations of metal musicians drew inspiration from the Romantic era's emphasis on dark and intense themes, further shaping the genre's aesthetic.\n\nThe Beatles' song \"Helter Skelter,\" often cited as a precursor to heavy metal, exemplifies the movement's darker side. Its chaotic and unsettling lyrics, possibly reflecting the impact of drug use, showcase a departure from the band's typical style. This song, a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier musical direction, demonstrated the Beatles' willingness to explore darker musical territory.",
            "Several decades before the Surrealists explored dreamlike imagery in their art, Henri Rousseau, a Post-Impressionist painter, was meticulously crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. His 1910 painting, \"The Dream,\" depicts a woman marveling at the wonders of her dreamland, but it also reflects Rousseau's own aspirations as an artist. Throughout his career, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and praise from the art world, facing a difficult internal conflict in pursuing this goal. \"The Dream\" encapsulates Rousseau's lifelong struggle: to conform to prevailing artistic styles to gain acceptance from the art community he admired, or to remain creatively independent and forge his own path.\n\nUnderstanding \"The Dream\" requires some familiarity with Rousseau's life. Born in 1844 in France, he received no formal art training and worked as a toll collector for the French government until he was forty. The loss of his wife and eight infant children deeply affected him, prompting him to find solace and a new beginning through painting. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized peasants in their art, Rousseau, a self-taught artist, captured the hopes and dreams of the ordinary working class.\n\nRousseau's desire for recognition was understandable given his circumstances. He started painting later in life, lacked formal training, and was working alongside many established and talented artists like Matisse. While both artists were contemporaries, their motivations were different, as noted by art historian Jan Gordon. Matisse feared creating conventional art, while Rousseau sought to produce something so traditional that he would be accepted into the prestigious \"Artiste Français\" society.",
            "Many philosophers have recognized a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, believing truth and beauty are intertwined.  This connection stems from the fact that our understanding of ethics and aesthetics isn't solely based on education or experience, as Keats suggests in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn.\"  Instead, these concepts are more about describing than prescribing. We strive to explain what makes art beautiful or an action moral, rather than establishing rigid rules for creation or judgment.\n\nFurthermore, critiquing art or morality often falls short of capturing their true essence. Describing the technical elements of a masterpiece like the Mona Lisa, for example, doesn't fully explain its artistic merit. We often find ourselves saying \"There's just something about it\" when asked about our favorite art or literature, acknowledging that something transcends mere description.\n\nSimilarly, ethics seems to possess this ineffable quality. Like Flannery O'Connor states, stories convey truths that words alone cannot express. No matter how meticulously we analyze a work of literature, there remains a transcendent element. Wittgenstein echoes this sentiment, suggesting ethics is transcendental and cannot be fully articulated.  \n\nI believe this \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, is the most compelling aspect of both art and morality. This shared transcendental nature forms a bridge between them. \n\nBoth ethics and art impact us profoundly on a noumenal level, a realm beyond rational explanation. This connection is particularly strong in literary art, as McKean points out. Literature's inherent moral quality distinguishes it from other art forms.  Literature's relevance stems from the values it reflects, mirroring the values inherent in life itself.",
            "Germany is renowned today as a powerful and unified nation, boasting a distinct culture that spans from the Bavarian Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This cultural identity is palpable in cities like Cologne on the Rhine River, weaving its way through the heart of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River. Given this unique heritage, it's unsurprising that modern Germany emerged from a confluence of diverse tribes and influences. \n\nThe ancestral homeland of the Germans is known as Germania. The origin of this name is hotly debated among scholars and historians. Tacitus, a Roman historian, suggested it derived from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were known as Germans before crossing the Rhine to clash with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98).  Julius Caesar, in his account of the Gallic Wars, first used the term \"Germanus\" to differentiate between the conquered Gauls and the unconquered Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine, often under deceptive pretenses (Caesar, 50-40 BC). He borrowed the word from the Gauls themselves. Some believe it referred to a neighboring people in the Gaulish language. Caesar himself wrote in the first book of his Gallic Wars: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC).  Other theories suggest the name originates from the spear used in Germanic warfare, known as a \"ger\" (O.E.D, 2010), or from the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" hinting at the Germans' perceived loudness or boisterousness (\"Names of Germany\").\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" explored the origins of the Germans, stating: “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?” (Tacitus, 98).\n\nWhile the Romans did engage in campaigns and trade with Germanic tribes, they largely avoided permanently settling in Germania. As Germanic tribes emerged in the first century AD, they resided on the borders of the Roman Empire, exchanging goods and contributing their skills by serving in the Roman army (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "I stared down, my mind processing the scene before me in a detached, analytical way. Thoughts flitted in and out, too quickly to form coherent ideas. It felt like my consciousness was simply observing, without any real emotional engagement.  \n\nI had once tried to improve my drawing skills by following the instructions in a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" It taught about how the brain interprets lines and suggested a technique of focusing on a single element by mentally framing it. \n\nThis time, however, I felt overwhelmed by the situation. I was struck by the sheer magnitude of the task, like facing the start of a grand artistic project.  \n\nMy hand, trembling slightly, reached for the toilet brush, attempting to channel my creativity into this mundane task.  The water swirled, clean and serene, as I tried to work through the initial shock. But the stubborn object refused to budge, stuck like a stubborn lump.  \n\nWith a sigh, I gripped the mop and stared at the mess, a symbol of someone else's carelessness. The green tie around my neck felt like a tightrope walker’s rope, constricting my spirit.",
            "Teenage drivers are involved in a disproportionately high number of fatal car accidents. This issue stems from a combination of factors, including the underdeveloped nature of the teen brain, lack of experience, and the influence of peers. Studies show that teen drivers, especially those with younger passengers, are more likely to be involved in crashes. \n\nWhile some states have implemented provisional licenses with restrictions on driving hours and passenger limits, these measures are seen as temporary solutions. The core problem is that young drivers, statistically, are not yet equipped to handle the complexities and risks associated with driving. Experts suggest that the urge for thrill-seeking common among teenagers contributes to this danger. \n\nRaising the driving age to at least 18 could significantly reduce accidents.  A potential legislative solution involves maintaining driver's education in schools but prohibiting anyone under 18 from obtaining a license.  Provisional permits and supervised practice hours could still be implemented, with the number of hours aligned with current state requirements.  \n\nNational legislation on this issue would ensure consistent safety standards across the country and effectively protect young lives.",
            "My analysis of fifteen trick films produced by Edison between 1895 and 1901, housed in the Library of Congress, focused on their visual storytelling techniques and evolutionary developments.  These films primarily rely on creative editing to create illusions, adhering to a set of conventions typical of early cinema. \n\nThese conventions include a fixed camera position within a frontal proscenium, resembling a stage setup, with no camera movement to follow action.  This framing style, borrowed from theatre and vaudeville, often restricts movement to side-to-side, as seen in films like \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900).\n\nAs a result, shots tend to be long or medium shots, with close-ups absent, mirroring the theatrical tradition of presenting the entire performance within the stage's boundaries. The one-shot-equals-one-film approach, prevalent in early cinema, limits the films to a minute or less and often focuses on short, vaudeville-style tricks rather than elaborate narratives. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that a single \"shot\" in these films may actually encompass multiple physically filmed sequences edited together to create illusions like apparitions or disappearances.  For example, \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) appears as a single shot but reveals a separate filming sequence for Mary's severed \"head.\"",
            "John Taylor, a fervent early supporter of Republicanism, viewed his agricultural background and brief political career as shaping his commitment to individualism and limited government. His agrarian ideals heavily influenced his political stances on sovereignty, constitutional interpretation, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed the U.S. had a unique opportunity to establish an ideal government free from traditional constraints, emphasizing self-governance and the inherent rights of man. He stressed the interconnectedness of these rights, arguing that the infringement of one diminishes the value of all. These rights, he believed, should be protected from governmental encroachment.  He perceived the \"state of nature\" as favoring the physically strong and cunning, and sought to prevent this power imbalance in a civilized society.\n\nTo realize this ideal, Taylor advocated for a government that acknowledged both the good and evil inherent in humanity. He held a rigid dualistic view of morality, believing that government, being human-driven, inevitably reflects both virtues and vices. He defined good principles as those that safeguard private property, promote agriculture, and limit capitalism, arguing that such a government would function fairly regardless of its administration, which he acknowledged would be susceptible to self-interest. While recognizing self-interest as a fundamental human motive, he deemed it detrimental when it prioritized personal gain over the public good, leading to societal divisions. A strong government was necessary to contain this inherent evil, but it too must be closely monitored to prevent the adoption of harmful principles.\n\nLike many Republican contemporaries, Taylor championed a strict interpretation of the Constitution, advocating for a limited federal government with powers explicitly outlined therein. He feared the expense and potential for despotism associated with a larger federal entity. However, he cautioned against a purely literal interpretation, emphasizing the importance of understanding the framers' intentions. Furthermore, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true foundational document of the United States, as it more clearly articulated the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than a unified entity.",
            "The project observed a sharp decline in commuter log submissions during the third month, a trend that was concerning. Several factors might have contributed to this, including the onset of winter, the end of the fall semester, and the holiday season, all of which likely led to reduced campus presence. Additionally, it's possible that the initial enthusiasm for the project naturally waned over time. To address this, a \"Carpool Challenge Week\" was launched in March, boosting log submissions. This highlights a key challenge: sustaining project momentum amidst natural engagement fluctuations and seasonal breaks common in higher education.\n\nAnother hurdle was overcoming the deeply ingrained cultural preference for driving.  To encourage alternative commuting, various prizes were offered, including gift certificates to local businesses. While these incentives were effective initially, the authors speculate that larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars, might have further incentivized participation and mitigated the decline. They also suggest that escalating the value of prizes throughout the project, potentially by announcing larger rewards later on, could have been more effective.",
            "An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of investment security designed to mirror the performance of a specific index, commodity, or basket of assets, similar to an index fund. ETFs offer the diversification benefits of index funds while providing the flexibility to trade like individual stocks, allowing investors to engage in activities like short selling, margin trading, and purchasing fractional shares.  \n\nOne significant advantage of ETFs is their lower expense ratios compared to traditional mutual funds. However, investors should be aware that ETFs incur trading commissions, similar to stock transactions. Additionally, while ETFs boast a wide range of investment options, it's crucial for investors to critically assess the claimed benefits, such as diversification, to ensure they align with their investment goals. \n\nThis analysis focuses on ETF IHF and compares its performance to the top 10 holdings, which collectively account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. By examining these holdings, we aim to determine whether owning the ETF provides comparable benefits to owning a diversified portfolio of these individual stocks and explore potential alternative stock configurations that might yield a more optimal risk-adjusted return (measured by the Sharpe ratio).\n\nTo streamline the evaluation, we'll concentrate on the top 10 holdings. We'll calculate the contribution of each stock to the portfolio's beta and return, assuming the portfolio replicates the ETF's asset allocation.\n\nPreliminary findings indicate that a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings could potentially deliver a higher return (6.11%) with a lower beta (0.12) compared to the ETF. However, further statistical analysis is needed to confirm if these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTherefore, we'll calculate the standard deviation of each top 10 stock and normalize it to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation against the ETF IHF's standard deviation.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" one of his finest poems. In it, he uses the term \"Thulé,\" which he likely borrowed from both Virgil and the German author Goethe. While Virgil used \"Thulé\" to describe a mythical island beyond the known world, Poe's use of the term echoes the themes and characters in Goethe's poem \"The King of Thulé.\"  This connection is highlighted by literary scholars who see similarities between the mournful king in Goethe's poem and the speaker in Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" both grappling with loss and a sense of desolation.  \n\nPoe's familiarity with Goethe's work is further supported by his admiration for Tennyson, a poet who was heavily influenced by Goethe. Given Poe's respect for Tennyson and the wide availability of Goethe's works during Poe's time, it's plausible that Poe drew inspiration from \"The King of Thulé\" when crafting \"Dream-Land.\" Both poems explore themes of grief, isolation, and the allure of a shadowy, dreamlike realm.",
            "Could a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a California grocery store be awarded punitive damages if the store manager was informed about the spill twice but chose to ignore it for half an hour while eating dinner?  A judge is unlikely to immediately dismiss the customer's claim for punitive damages. To justify such an award, the customer must demonstrate that the manager's actions were intentional disregard for the potential harm, as well as highly reprehensible. The customer can argue that the manager should have known the risk of not cleaning the spill because multiple customers had slipped and fallen in similar incidents in the past. While the argument that the manager's actions were despicable might be less convincing, it is still reasonable considering the history of slip-and-fall incidents at the store.\n\nThe incident occurred on October 13, 2009, when two employees notified the manager, Paul Martin, about the applesauce spill. Martin, however, dismissed their concerns, citing his dinner break. Despite being informed twice, Martin failed to address the spill, and an hour later, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell, sustaining a serious back injury.  \n\nIn California, punitive damages can be awarded in cases where a defendant's actions involved oppression, fraud, or malice. Malice is defined as intentional harm or conduct that, lacking intent, is \"despicable\" and shows a deliberate disregard for others' safety. Courts have ruled that conduct can be considered malicious when a person is aware of the potential dangers of their actions and willingly chooses to ignore them.",
            "Four years ago, I took an Islam course at CBC where we debated whether Islam is inherently hostile. This question feels even more crucial today. Since 9/11, I've witnessed the media shift from a hostile stance towards Islam to excessive tolerance.  It's hard to imagine a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with his Muslim family background, running in 2001.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography intrigues me because it contradicts my previous understanding. I believed Muhammad forcibly converted people through conquest, but the biography portrays him as a misunderstood martyr who humbly led others to his teachings.\n\nInterestingly, there are parallels between Muhammad's ministry and Jesus' miracles, such as the story of multiplying food. This style of writing suggests an attempt to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, potentially diminishing the significance of Jesus' miracles.\n\nThe biography also relies heavily on third-party accounts, which I find questionable. While intended to demonstrate the authenticity of the stories, this reliance on hearsay weakens their credibility.\n\nUltimately, what bothers me most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly, humble, and wise figure while historical evidence suggests otherwise. I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "Christian thought has significantly diverged from Jesus' original teachings since his life.  This trend towards increasing distance from the source is apparent throughout history. While traditionalists resist change, their influence is likely to diminish as the world becomes more progressive. A growing awareness of this historical evolution will lead Christians in the future to yearn for a return to the core teachings of Jesus. Over decades or centuries, this desire will manifest as a movement stripping away layers of doctrine added over time, ultimately returning Christianity to its original form. This movement, driven by a desire to rediscover Jesus' true message, will sweep through the United States and Europe, unifying Christians in belief and practice across denominations and divisions.  \n\nThis historical trend, similar to past reversals such as the Roman Empire's transformation from persecutor to Christian institution, will see a return to uniformity in Christianity.  \n\nUnderstanding this evolution requires viewing Jesus' words metaphorically, rather than literally.  \n\nTracing the roots of Christianity reveals its origins in Judaism, a religion centered on monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures.  Even before Roman control of Jerusalem in 63 BCE, Judaism itself was diverse, with various groups like Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general populace.",
            "Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\" exposes the inherent greed and self-centeredness of humanity, particularly within the context of industrial capitalism. The novel depicts factory owners and managers as ruthless individuals driven solely by profit maximization, disregarding the well-being of their employees and the environment. Sinclair vividly portrays the stark contrast between the opulence of the factory owners and the squalid living and working conditions of the workers.\n\nThe imagery of \"the line of buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\" highlights the destructive industrial pollution and the callous indifference of the owners towards its consequences.  They prioritize financial gain over human life, symbolized by the \"great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories\" and the unchecked waste from the surrounding animal pens.\n\nThe novel also exposes the exploitative labor practices prevalent in Packingtown. The owners exploit their employees through long hours, unsafe working conditions, and arbitrary layoffs without any safety nets or support. The absence of worker protections allows the owners to treat their employees as expendable commodities, valuing profit above human dignity.  Sinclair uses the phrase \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\" to emphasize the dehumanizing nature of the system.\n\nThe workers, trapped in a cycle of poverty and exploitation, are likened to slaves, highlighting the stark parallels between the conditions in Packingtown and the horrors of chattel slavery.  Their lack of agency and the absence of support systems further emphasize the systemic injustice they face.",
            "Authors employ various techniques to evoke specific feelings or perspectives in readers regarding significant themes. F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully utilizes several of these techniques in his novel *The Great Gatsby*. One notable technique is his unconventional pairing of adjectives and nouns to create a particular aura around certain subjects. Fitzgerald also imbues symbolism with meaning, using colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink to achieve this purpose. In *The Great Gatsby*, he builds layers of meaning around white/gray, associating them with uniformity. White represents a more refined and elevated class, while gray denotes an older, faded quality.  \n\nFitzgerald establishes this meaning early on through consistent use of these colors. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are constantly depicted in white, signifying their social standing and perhaps a sense of superficiality. This prevalence of white extends to other characters and settings, emphasizing the pervasive nature of this association. In contrast, Fitzgerald uses gray to describe less significant elements, suggesting a sense of banality or insignificance.  He uses these colors to color everyday objects and people, reinforcing the established meanings. \n\nBy repeatedly associating white/gray with specific themes, Fitzgerald later utilizes them to convey a sense of unimportance or uniformity in relation to certain characters and objects. This technique is particularly evident in his portrayal of Daisy. After a period of limited use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy in a \"white roadster,\" subtly diminishing her characterization and presenting her as more of an object of desire for Gatsby.  Further instances of Daisy's description in white and gray reinforce this impression, highlighting her perceived conformity and lack of depth.",
            "San Diego County's favorable climate makes it ideal for agriculture, with popular crops including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a strong demand for organic produce, leading to long waiting lists for community supported agriculture (CSA) programs. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms offer tours, hiking trails, birdwatching opportunities, and other recreational activities, demonstrating how farming can combine profit with environmental stewardship. \n\nOne potential strategy for landowners is to utilize government programs to support organic farming practices that benefit both profitability and wildlife habitats. Organic farming, while often more labor-intensive and potentially less efficient than conventional methods, promotes biodiversity and reduces chemical use.  Additional practices, such as cover cropping, rotational grazing, invasive species removal, and habitat management, can further enhance wildlife benefits but may also increase labor costs. \n\nThis example focuses on a 160-acre parcel near Potrero, California, encompassing chaparral, grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This area is crucial due to its location within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, which is part of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This plan aims to protect over a hundred species, including endangered ones like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and mountain yellow-legged frog. \n\nThe land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries, followed by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. \n\nBy researching government programs and examining successful organic farms in the region, landowners can explore ways to balance financial viability with ecological conservation efforts.",
            "Culture significantly influences negotiations, shaping interactions and outcomes.  While generalizations about cultures can be tempting, it's crucial to recognize that cultures are complex and diverse.  Instead of relying on stereotypes, negotiators should strive to understand the specific cultural values and norms at play in each situation. This involves appreciating how these cultural elements might impact communication styles, decision-making processes, and overall negotiation strategies.\n\nApproaching unfamiliar cultures with an open mind and a willingness to learn is essential.  Understanding a culture's history, perspectives, and potential biases can help bridge cultural gaps and foster productive discussions.  Respecting traditions and beliefs, particularly when in a weaker bargaining position, can pave the way for successful negotiations.\n\nFurthermore, it's important to remember that culture extends beyond national boundaries. Companies often develop their own distinct cultures, influencing everything from work hours and dress codes to communication styles and philanthropic practices. Recognizing these internal cultural variations within organizations adds another layer of complexity to the negotiating landscape.\n\nValues lie at the heart of a culture, providing insights into its motivations and priorities.  For example, a culture that values saving face might prioritize avoiding public humiliation, while a culture that emphasizes competitiveness might be more inclined to push for a favorable outcome.  \n\nUltimately, successful negotiation requires a combination of cultural awareness, respect for individual differences, and a willingness to adapt one's approach accordingly.",
            "This essay analyzes the arguments of St. Anselm and St. Thomas Aquinas for the existence of God. Both philosophers assume the existence of the God of the Bible, focusing on their distinct approaches to proving His presence. Anselm emphasizes faith and introspection, arguing that God's existence is inherently known within our minds. He believes that the very concept of God necessitates His existence, making empirical evidence unnecessary. In contrast, Aquinas relies solely on reason and observable evidence, presenting five logical arguments – change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony – to demonstrate God's logical necessity.  \n\nWhile both provide compelling arguments, the essay questions whether either fully establishes a comprehensive basis for belief in God. Anselm's reliance on faith may not satisfy those seeking concrete proof, while Aquinas's arguments, while logical, rely on assumptions that may be debated.",
            "Around the 5th or 6th century BCE, a prince who later became known as Buddha was born. He renounced worldly possessions, achieved enlightenment, and his teachings gave rise to Buddhism. The most traditional branch of Buddhism, Theravada Buddhism, is approximately 2,500 years old. Over time, it has evolved significantly from its original form. This evolution is evident in various aspects, such as the annual water-cutting ceremony in Sri Lanka, a Theravada Buddhist nation. This ceremony, involving both monks and lay people, holds religious significance despite Buddha not mentioning any such festivity during his lifetime. These changes encompass both external practices and core theological principles. The Theravada Buddhist community, both monastic and lay, has adapted its doctrines over time due to both internal and external influences, both positive and negative.\n\nThis discussion will frequently use specific terms: \"internal\" and \"external\" forces. An \"internal force\" originates from members of the Buddhist community, regardless of their monastic status. An \"external force\" comes from non-Buddhist sources.  A \"hostile force\" aims to damage or harm the Buddhist community, stemming from a negative perception of Buddhism. A \"benign force,\" on the other hand, does not intend to harm or help the community, but its actions may have unintended consequences. These terms will be recurring throughout the analysis.\n\nUnderstanding the core doctrines of Theravada Buddhism is crucial. Buddhists seek refuge in the \"triple gem\": the Buddha, the Dhamma (teachings), and the Sangha (community). The Dhamma encompasses the Tripitaka—the three baskets of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains the discourses of Buddha, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. Key metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these concepts is essential to ending Sansara (the cycle of death and rebirth) and achieving enlightenment. Along with Sansara, desires (lobha), hatred (dosa), and delusion (moha) cease. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for conduct. Laypeople adhere to five precepts (non-killing, non-lying, non-stealing, non-sexual misconduct, and abstaining from intoxicants), while monks follow a more extensive set of monastic rules.  The foundational principle in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, Dukkha—life is inherently suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico experienced a long-standing rivalry from 1836 to 1893, marked by numerous conflicts and tensions. The rivalry reached its peak during the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), where the U.S. emerged victorious, gaining Texas and the American Southwest.  This rivalry, rooted in differences in religion, culture, and competing economic interests, mirrored similar tensions between neighboring nations. As David M. Pletcher observed, the U.S. faced enduring diplomatic challenges primarily with Mexico and Cuba, both geographically close and historically rivals. \n\nReligious differences, particularly anti-Catholic sentiment among Americans, further fueled the animosity, echoing the ideological struggles of the Cold War. This distrust stemmed from the historical rivalry between England and Spain, their former colonial rulers.\n\nDuring this 57-year period, 17 disputes arose, primarily concerning territorial issues and border skirmishes. Banditry and outlaws operating across the border were a constant problem until both nations increased their military presence along the frontier.\n\nBy the late 19th century, Mexico's economic dependence on the U.S. and a shift in American interests from territorial expansion to economic influence in Mexico gradually lessened the rivalry.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was unexpectedly disabled by an illness I had never encountered before.  As a nurse, I had chosen my profession for the stability and security I lacked as a child, believing that healthcare was a reliable source of employment. While my true passions lay in science and journalism, I ultimately settled for nursing. However, at the age of 46 and single, I found myself without savings and unable to work due to my disability. After 15 years on Social Security Disability, I have depleted my resources and face daily struggles that threaten my security, safety, and self-esteem. Despite the uncertainty in my life, one certainty remains: I wouldn't have survived these years without the support of my family and close friends, proving that even the strongest individuals need help during times of crisis.\n\nLife inevitably throws curveballs, both big and small.  Despite careful planning, some challenges are too overwhelming to handle alone.  \n\nWhile I agree that we should be wary of relying solely on government assistance, I believe Americans need to rediscover the importance of community and mutual support.  Rather than isolating ourselves in self-sufficiency, we should learn to trust and help one another.  \n\nThe American ideal of \"rugged individualism\" often overshadows the truth: our ancestors persevered not solely through individual strength, but through compassion, respect, and shared resources.  The pioneers who journeyed westward relied on each other to survive.\n\nTherefore, be prepared for emergencies.  Stock up on supplies like a disaster kit, first aid, water purification tablets, and non-perishable food.  If possible, consider gardening or having a wood stove.  But equally important is building strong connections with your neighbors.",
            "The evolution of organisms and the factors that shape their development are complex questions that scientists continue to explore. While fully understanding these processes remains a challenge, mathematical modeling has emerged as a valuable tool for investigating evolutionary and developmental change.  \n\nThis study focuses on the application of mathematical modeling to the evolution of shell morphology in the mollusk genus *Prunum*. By combining mathematical models with experimental observations and traditional descriptive studies, researchers aim to decipher the mechanisms driving changes in shell shape and size over evolutionary time. \n\nTo achieve this, the researchers used X-ray images of *Prunum* species to quantify shell features and create digital models. These models were then used to simulate hypothetical shell morphologies, helping to define the potential range of evolutionary possibilities. The findings from these modeling exercises are being integrated with experimental and descriptive data to gain a more comprehensive understanding of macroevolutionary trends in this group of mollusks.\n\n\nThe study highlights the unique nature of shells, describing them as three-dimensional structures that develop through a series of coiled whorls spiraling around a central axis known as the columella. The size and shape of these whorls, along with the sutures separating them, contribute to the overall form of the shell. The researchers also discuss different ways of viewing and analyzing shells, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. \n\nUltimately, the researchers view shell development as a series of apertures moving through space and time as the organism grows. By tracing the path of these apertures mathematically, they hope to uncover the underlying principles governing shell morphogenesis.",
            "Despite progress in areas like water and sanitation, Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have remained stagnant for the past decade.  While the country is striving to meet the Millennium Development Goals, significant improvements in child and maternal health are lacking to achieve the 2015 targets.  This stagnation highlights the need to strengthen the overall health system rather than relying solely on targeted programs.\n\nAlthough the percentage of births attended by skilled health workers has increased to 72%, this figure includes traditional practitioners who may not be equipped to handle complications, contributing to high maternal mortality rates due to hemorrhage.  Furthermore, the decline in the percentage of children under five treated for diarrhea by healthcare professionals is concerning.  Data on postnatal care is limited but suggests a need for improvement across the country.\n\nCesarean section rates remain low at 4%, with a stark disparity between urban (7%) and rural (2%) areas, underscoring inequalities in healthcare access.  The gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles (27%) further emphasizes the challenges faced by low-income communities in accessing healthcare, likely due to financial constraints.\n\nMoving forward, Indonesia faces a critical question: should it focus on specific programs or strengthen the entire health system? While targeted programs offer quick results and manageable objectives, they can divert resources from other areas and lead to duplication of services.  Investing heavily in one sector can also result in a brain drain, as skilled personnel gravitate towards areas with more funding, as seen with the impact of HIV/AIDS funding on family planning programs.",
            "Victorian novels are typically known for their meticulous attention to detail and focus on the aristocracy. However, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" while considered Victorian novels, deviate from this trend. Both incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, which is uncommon in novels of that era. This stylistic choice strengthens the characters by providing deeper insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\nAn example of this can be seen in a passage from \"Oliver Twist\": \"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\"  \n\nThe novels often utilize mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the content and purpose vary in each case. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these strange occurrences often reveal insights into Oliver's inner turmoil, his suffering, and his understanding of the true nature of events around him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he relives the experience vividly, as if in a dream, while struggling to find help. The passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the unfolding events and the dire state of his health, evident in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing his senses as he doesn't notice the \"unseen hand\" carrying him away. He experiences his despair anew, detached from the initial shock of pain, as the pain becomes a constant, linked to fear rather than surprise.  Oliver's helplessness raises the question of whose will orchestrated his misfortune, as it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the idea that Oliver has little control over his life, unable to even attempt to influence the outcome of an event, even when his life is in danger. The passage also suggests a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if Fagin has broken him, forcing him to accept this despair and hindering his ability to react. Otherwise, it is reasonable to assume Oliver would have made some effort, at least to save himself.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.\"",
            "A few years ago, while working as a tutor in an after-school program for elementary students, I noticed a peculiar reading challenge with a third or fourth-grade boy named Adrian. Despite speaking perfect English, he struggled with pronunciation, understanding some letters perfectly while others were completely foreign to him. His Latino heritage led me to believe his first language was Spanish.  \n\nThe situation became clearer when Adrian's mother, who only spoke Spanish, arrived during a field trip.  With my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate, and it dawned on me that Adrian wasn't necessarily reading poorly, but rather lacked a strong grasp of the English alphabet. \n\nThis experience highlighted the complexities of language barriers in schools, particularly in California.  Even for students who speak English fluently, reading can pose significant obstacles. While tutoring Adrian in English phonics and alphabet recognition proved helpful in his case, the challenges faced by children with limited English proficiency are much more multifaceted.\n\nEffective solutions require a multi-pronged approach. Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes all have their merits, but no single solution is sufficient. Combining these approaches is crucial.\n\nDual language programs offer significant benefits for all children, not just those whose first language is Spanish. Research shows that students in these programs often outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns about resource allocation and lack of benefit for the majority, widespread implementation of dual language programs would benefit all students.\n\nWhile requiring all teachers to be bilingual might be unrealistic, incorporating bilingual aids or tutors could effectively support language learning.",
            "From a young age, many of us are taught about a higher power, something beyond our understanding. Some seek answers in organized religion, while others explore spirituality within themselves.  We often adopt the beliefs of our upbringing, but some reject them entirely, focusing solely on their own experiences. Our perspectives on spirituality evolve over time, leading us on a personal journey to find meaning and guidance in life.  We yearn for light amidst darkness, seeking a path to enlightenment.\n\nThe story then shifts to a poignant moment shared between a father and child. The father, facing his own mortality, reflects on life while listening to the rain. The son, sensing his father's fragility, feels a deep sense of loss and struggles to express his emotions. They sit together in silence, united by their shared experience.\n\nTragically, the father passes away shortly after, leaving his son grappling with grief and questioning his faith. He feels abandoned by a God who seemingly ignores his pleas. The son chooses to avoid witnessing his father's death, honoring his belief that his father wouldn't want him to be a passive observer. He retreats into solitude, waiting for news of his father's passing.  The indifference of those around him adds to his feelings of isolation and pain.",
            "The Gothic novel is a paradoxical blend of old and new, as literary scholar Ian Watt aptly describes it. It has been both criticized and celebrated, sometimes dismissed as superficial and other times lauded for its evocative \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" considered the first Gothic novel, skillfully merges elements of ancient and modern romances to establish a new literary style. Walpole combines traditional theatrical elements with the more intimate, psychologically driven style of modern novels, creating what he calls \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). \n\nThe Gothic genre draws heavily on medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, even though the term \"Gothic\" itself was often used disparagingly at the time, associated with archaism and lack of sophistication compared to the perceived advancements of the modern era. The unique fusion of the theatrical \"Gothic\" with the novel's ability to delve into characters' inner lives contributes to the genre's enduring appeal, allowing it to remain both timeless and strangely novel to readers across generations.\n\nA key concept in Gothic novels is chivalry, reflecting the medieval ideal of knightly training.  Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, often romanticize this concept because it represents the epitome of bravery, honor, and competence—qualities they believed were lacking in contemporary society. By resurrecting chivalric ideals, they implicitly critique the present and yearn for a return to a perceived golden age. Walpole, writing during a time of political turmoil and personal accusations, may have felt a particular sense of disillusionment with modern society, leading him to romanticize the supposed morality and inherent goodness of the past. This sentiment is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits: he is a prince, a tragic figure, and is believed to have been killed by enemies. This idealized portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" (66) foreshadows the Gothic trope of exaggeration and excess.",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the intricate processes involved in moving goods from a customer's order through every stage, including raw materials, supply, production, and distribution, until the product reaches the customer.  Coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, this term highlights the strategic planning, execution, and monitoring of these processes to meet customer needs efficiently and promptly.\n\nSix key elements form the backbone of a successful supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Businesses leverage these elements to deliver exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction, the initial stage, lays the groundwork for the entire supply chain. It involves defining the \"when,\" \"why,\" \"where,\" and \"how\" of production.  Understanding customer demand is paramount, and market analysis serves as a vital indicator. By scrutinizing market trends, managers can determine customer preferences and make informed decisions about product types and quantities.  \n\nOnce production scope is determined, managers identify the optimal production location, considering factors like volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. Determining production schedules and equipment maintenance fall under this stage.  Careful planning at each stage is crucial, as any oversight can lead to significant time and financial losses.  \n\nThe second key element is supply, encompassing strategic decisions regarding core facility capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Companies often have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with distinct equipment, workforce, and specializations. Managers must strategically allocate tasks among these divisions or consider outsourcing to external companies. Outsourcing aims to enhance velocity, achieving quality, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.",
            "Ellen Page, known for her role in the film \"Juno,\" holds a sign on a street corner that reads, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" The sign highlights the ongoing oppression in Myanmar (formerly Burma), a Southeast Asian nation ruled by a military junta that seized power in 1962. \n\nIn 2007, a series of protests, known as the \"Saffron Revolution,\" erupted led by Buddhist monks who were demanding democratic reforms. Initially peaceful, the protests were met with brutal force by the military. Journalists were imprisoned, and some, like Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai, were killed. Despite official claims of limited casualties, defectors from the military suggest the death toll was significantly higher.\n\nThis pattern of government suppression of dissent is not unique to Myanmar. Throughout history, regimes have sought to maintain absolute control, from ancient Roman emperors claiming divine authority to the current U.S. president's alleged meetings with the leader of a fictional group.\n\nExamples of such atrocities include the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in China, where the government violently suppressed student-led protests, and the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s, where Hutu extremists, with government support, systematically killed Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The Holocaust, perpetrated by Nazi Germany, stands as a horrific example of state-sanctioned genocide against Jews.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring legacy in jazz stems from his long career and his exceptional ability to shape his orchestra. Although his piano playing is often understated in his compositions, Ellington was a masterful composer who created intricate and vibrant pieces that showcased the individual talents of his band members. He meticulously crafted musical frameworks that allowed for improvisation while also composing tightly arranged sections and phrases that highlighted the unique styles of each musician. This attention to detail contributed to the distinct and original tonal qualities of his orchestra, making each piece unique and coherent. Ellington's deep understanding of his musicians' individual sounds and how they blended together as an ensemble enabled him to compose some of the most innovative and brilliant works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative use of voice as a \"jazz instrument\" throughout his career, citing \"Creole Love Call\" as an early example.  This piece demonstrates Ellington's ability to use voice for added texture and color without relying on lyrics. It also showcases his talent for complementing the styles of his soloists, a characteristic that permeates his entire body of work.  This slow, bluesy twelve-bar piece, composed of six choruses, features a call-and-response dynamic between voice and reeds, with the voice transitioning from smooth and melodic to rougher towards the end.  A muted trumpet solo follows, elaborating on the melody and emphasizing bluesy notes. A soaring clarinet solo backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase comes next, followed by the full band echoing the first chorus with a call-and-response between brass and reeds. The climactic fifth chorus sees the reeds leading the call-and-response at a higher register, supported by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. The final chorus returns to the structure of the first, with a call-and-response between voice and reeds, this time featuring the voice using a \"growl\" technique, showcasing it as an instrument. The piece concludes with a brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant ending from the trombone.\n\nEllington's innovative use of voice in \"Creole Love Call\" is just one example of the stylistic approach that defines his music.  In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington combines his mastery of orchestration with his keen ear for tonal color. A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing blends the vocal qualities of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice, creating a rich and complementary sound. In \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" Ellington further emphasizes these ideas by featuring Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a mainstay in his orchestra, introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "She had always felt a deep yearning for something she couldn't quite define. This desire began during her teenage years and persisted even at 17. While she yearned for a connection with someone, she found herself uninterested in any boys who showed romantic interest. This lack of romantic inclination puzzled her, leading to much introspection and speculation. Despite her efforts, she couldn't pinpoint the reason for this unusual situation. She continued to navigate life, constantly questioning her desires.\n\nHer family life was usually peaceful. Her parents were calm and rarely argued, and disagreements with their daughter were uncommon. The only area of friction stemmed from her assertive and independent nature, which contrasted with their more subdued personalities.  Despite this, her outgoing and friendly disposition made her well-liked.\n\nHowever, this day was anything but ordinary. As she searched for inspiration, a scream from the kitchen startled her. Racing to her mother's aid, she found her lying on the floor in pain. Her mother, struggling to speak, managed to tell her daughter she needed to go to the hospital.  Relieved that she had taken self-defense classes, the daughter quickly carried her mother to the car and drove her to the hospital.\n\nThe sterile atmosphere of the hospital was overshadowed by her daughter's anxiety for her mother's well-being. She rushed her mother inside, calling for medical assistance. Doctors and nurses quickly gathered around, taking her mother to be examined. \n\nIt turned out her mother had fallen off a step stool while reaching for a vase on a high shelf.",
            "This study examined the connection between adhering to a modified Mediterranean diet (aMed diet) and the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke-related deaths. The aMed diet emphasizes plant-based foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, and fish, while limiting animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted. \n\nPrevious research suggested a link between a traditional Mediterranean diet and reduced risk of heart disease and mortality. This study, focusing on 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 from the Nurses' Health Study, tracked their dietary habits over 20 years using food frequency questionnaires. \n\nThe researchers calculated a cumulative aMed diet score for each participant, taking into account factors like age, smoking, body mass index, hormone use, physical activity, and other lifestyle factors. They found that women with higher aMed scores had a significantly lower risk of developing CHD and stroke compared to those with lower scores. During the study, 2391 cases of CHD, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular deaths occurred. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a 29% reduced risk of CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile.",
            "The U.S. economy suffered a severe financial crisis in 2007, marked by rising unemployment, a collapsing housing market, and the downfall of major corporations. This recession's ongoing impact compels us to examine its causes and potential solutions.  The crisis stemmed from irresponsible and shortsighted political decisions that encouraged banks and firms to issue subprime loans into an already fragile financial system.  Government entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac further exacerbated the situation by packaging these risky mortgages into complex investments known as CDOs and CDSs.  When borrowers defaulted, banks faced capital shortages and transferred their losses onto these repackaged mortgages, ultimately destabilizing the entire economy.\n\nThe roots of this crisis can be traced back to 1999 during the Clinton administration.  President Clinton, seeking re-election, relaxed lending regulations to boost his popularity, inadvertently setting the stage for the subprime crisis years later.  As reported by the New York Times, Fannie Mae, under pressure from the government and shareholders, aggressively expanded its mortgage lending, a move that was foreseen by journalist Steven Holmes to potentially lead to a government bailout similar to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.  \n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the complex structure of mortgages.  Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs intertwined various sectors of the economy with the housing market, leading to excessive leverage and vulnerability to price fluctuations.  When the housing bubble burst, financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities suffered significant losses.  The crisis had a devastating impact on major investment banks, forcing some, like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, into bankruptcy or government intervention, while others, like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, were forced to restructure as commercial banks under strict regulation.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, also came under government control in 2008.",
            "Exposition, the part of a story where you explain background information, can be tricky. While it's important to give readers context, too much exposition can be boring and make them lose interest. \n\nThink of it like this: instead of simply stating facts about a character, show their personality and history through their actions, words, and interactions with others.  \n\nFor example, instead of saying a character was deeply in love with their husband, describe their loving gestures, conversations, and how their husband's presence made them feel. This creates a stronger emotional connection for the reader and makes the character's grief more impactful when their husband dies.\n\nWhen writing, resist the urge to rush through important details about your characters. Take the time to flesh them out and make them feel real to your readers.",
            "I watched two Columbus, Ohio newscasts on August 13, 2011. The first, NBC 4, featured a brief report on Shad Hostettler, a man who had stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. Details were limited, stating only that she had been stabbed multiple times and he had been arrested. \n\nThe second story involved the shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in Sharon Woods. He was critically injured, and the SWAT team was investigating. I felt this story was short, possibly due to Buyers' race. I've noticed a pattern of media downplaying crimes involving minorities compared to those involving white victims.\n\nThe news also covered a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, likely caused by a .22 caliber rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest. \n\nA short weather update followed, mentioning predicted rain and thunderstorms for the weekend. \n\nA robbery at a UDF on Clime Road was reported, with emphasis given to the robber's race and appearance (a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie). This level of detail regarding his race felt unusual.\n\nFinally, the news covered Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin sentenced to 25 years for marijuana distribution to Ohio.  The unusual phrasing of \"300 months\" instead of years was noted, as well as the mention of his Hispanic ethnicity, which seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "The bond between brothers is unique and unbreakable, encompassing a complex mix of emotions like love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers share a deep understanding that transcends ordinary relationships, seeing a reflection of themselves in each other. This bond is most vividly revealed in times of crisis, revealing its true nature, whether positive or negative.  Comprehending the emotions stemming from this fraternal connection involves accepting the consequences that come with them. Looking into a brother's eyes allows one to see their true self, not how others perceive them, but their genuine essence. Their actions and the repercussions of those actions ultimately define their character.  \n\n\"The Scarlet Ibis\" explores this theme through the relationship between two brothers, highlighting the intense emotions that accompany it. Set against a lush and vivid backdrop, the brothers embark on a doomed journey. The story culminates in a clash between bitter disappointment and intense pride, leaving only one brother alive. The theme is conveyed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with his brother, as well as the narrator's perspective, which reveals the protagonist's complex feelings and his perception of the world around him, both of which heavily influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are primarily driven by pride. From their first outings together to their final, tragic expedition, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He yearned for a brother who could keep up with his aspirations, participating in activities like running, jumping, and climbing. He envisioned a brother who could be his companion in adventures and games.  However, Doodle's physical limitations, due to a weak heart, shattered these dreams. This realization deeply disappointed the protagonist, who even contemplated harming Doodle out of frustration. This dark thought, while fleeting, reveals the depth of his anger and resentment. Yet, Doodle's innocent smile melts the protagonist's anger, showcasing a lingering love beneath the surface.",
            "The human brain is a complex system responsible for processing information in creative ways. As technology has evolved, so too have the metaphors used to describe the brain, progressing from simple comparisons like a wax tablet or papyrus to more sophisticated analogies like a computer. However, it's important to remember that these metaphors have limitations and can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory input, where our senses transform physical stimuli into electrochemical signals. These signals are then processed by the brain through two primary mechanisms: bottom-up and top-down processing. Bottom-up processing analyzes basic elements like color and shape to build a complete understanding, while top-down processing utilizes prior knowledge and expectations to speed up recognition. For example, when viewing a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing identifies the individual components, while top-down processing helps us quickly recognize it as a box based on our existing knowledge.\n\nAttention plays a crucial role in filtering and prioritizing information. While our brain processes a vast amount of sensory data, attention allows us to focus on specific stimuli, such as our name in a noisy room, while filtering out irrelevant information, like individual blades of grass. This filtering occurs throughout the processing stages, shaping our perception and understanding.\n\nFor information to be processed, it must first be stored in different types of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. Information is initially encoded based on the type of sensory input, such as visually, auditorily, or semantically. Working memory, which holds information for a short period (around 20 seconds), is thought to be maintained by electrical signals looping through neurons. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is believed to be stored in the structure of specific proteins.\n\nNumerous models attempt to explain how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing upon insights from psychology, computer science, and neuroscience. One prominent model is the semantic network model, which proposes that concepts are represented as nodes interconnected based on their relationships. For instance, \"chair\" would be linked to \"table,\" which in turn might be linked to \"wooden,\" creating a network of interconnected concepts.",
            "Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" critiques the dangers of both technological advancement and the capitalist system that perpetuates it. The novel depicts a dystopian society where individuals are conditioned to prioritize community and instant gratification over personal fulfillment. Citizens are mere cogs in a machine, controlled by the World Controller and confined to a single, imposed ideology. \n\nThrough a Marxist lens, Huxley's anxieties about these emerging systems become apparent. Terms like \"homogeny\" and \"reification,\" central to Marxist thought, suggest that the novel serves as a critique of the flaws inherent in the economic structures of Huxley's time.\n\nCapitalism is satirized through the concept of \"false consciousness,\" where the working class is kept oblivious to their true economic position due to their focus on personal gain. This ideological control, evident in the conditioning of the citizens in \"Brave New World,\" strips lower classes like Deltas and Gammas of their independent will.  They are driven by a hyper-focus on consuming and indulging, a result of manipulation by the World Controller. \n\nThe novel exemplifies \"hegemony,\" where a ruling class exerts dominance over subordinate classes. The lower classes are unaware of this manipulation, unknowingly supporting the capitalist system through their consumerism.  While upper classes like Alphas and Betas are aware, they remain passive and complicit.\n\nRelationships in \"Brave New World\" are superficial and devoid of depth.  Individuality and free expression seem suppressed by the pervasive influence of technology and capitalism.  Love and strong emotions are absent, replaced by shallow interactions focused on physical appearance and momentary pleasure. The characters' acceptance of their societal roles further emphasizes the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, mirroring Marx's idea of the proletariat being conditioned to believe in their own superiority as long as they consume and obey.",
            "As a student at University Park for over two years, I've experienced firsthand the challenges of navigating the sprawling campus. During my freshman year, living in East Halls, the furthest dorms, commuting to classes in central locations like Willard Building could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially during State College's frequent bad weather. \n\nThe campus has significantly expanded since then, with the once-vast, unused land between East Halls and the rest of the university now filled with sports fields, new buildings, and apartments. This growth has made getting around even more difficult.\n\nWhile a bicycle is an excellent solution for campus mobility, it requires both student adoption and infrastructure that caters to cyclists. A friend who recently returned to cycling after a break shared that it's now his preferred mode of transportation due to its efficiency and convenience.\n\nPersonally, I live off-campus, a distance similar to some dorms, and owning a bike has been a game-changer. My daily commute to Thomas Building, a 25-minute walk, is reduced to just 5 minutes by bike. However, Pollock Road, the quickest route, can be challenging for cyclists.\n\nWhile walking is a viable option, my busy schedule makes it impractical. Without my bike, walking to classes and other appointments would consume an additional 2.5 hours per week, a time commitment I simply can't afford."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "This paper examines the biological and sociocultural factors contributing to insomnia. The biological model emphasizes the role of genetics and physiological factors in sleep, while the sociocultural model considers environmental influences such as race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The paper reviews research studies related to both models, analyzing their findings, strengths, and weaknesses to better understand insomnia.\n\nSleep disorders are categorized as primary, secondary to mental disorders, or secondary to medical conditions or substance use. Primary sleep disorders include dyssomnias (e.g., insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep disorders) and parasomnias (e.g., nightmare disorder, sleep terror disorder, sleepwalking disorder). Secondary sleep disorders arise from mental health conditions (Axis I or Axis II disorders) or medical issues. This review focuses primarily on insomnia and primary sleep disorders, exploring their connections to biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders centers on genetic predispositions and physiological mechanisms. Research on orexin neurons in the hypothalamus, which regulate sleep and wakefulness, suggests a link between the GABAB receptor and sleep regulation. Studies in mice have shown that activating the GABAB receptor promotes sleep, while inhibiting it reduces anxiety and induces sleep. These findings suggest a potential genetic basis for sleep disorders, where variations in the GABAB receptor could contribute to sleep problems. The sociocultural implications of this research highlight the interplay between genetics and environment, where inherited variations in the GABAB receptor could influence sleep patterns and potentially affect individuals' academic, professional, and daily functioning.",
            "This paper explores three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with a concise definition of the disorder. Next, it delves into the diagnosis of CAPD, outlining common indicators or \"red flags.\" Finally, the paper concludes by offering strategies that teachers in inclusive classroom settings can employ to support students with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to the brain's ability to effectively process auditory information.  While individuals with CAPD can hear normally, their brains struggle to translate and interpret sounds, making it difficult to distinguish words, separate conversations from background noise, or understand subtle changes in speech.\n\nThe origins of CAPD research can be traced back to the mid-1950s, initially termed \"auditory imperception.\"  Since then, researchers have developed tests and models to better understand the neurological basis of CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways, including difficulty localizing sounds, discriminating between similar sounds, recognizing sound patterns, understanding changes in speech tone, blocking out background noise, synthesizing auditory information, and determining the sequence of sounds.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a comprehensive assessment that combines observation of listening behaviors and standardized tests of auditory function.  These assessments are typically conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, or psychologists. While there is no single definitive test for CAPD, common methods include presenting patients with multiple sounds simultaneously and asking them to identify specific targets.",
            "Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\" explores the complexities of disguise and deception. While acknowledging that disguise can be effective for prolonged deceit, the play ultimately suggests that abandoning a fabricated identity is crucial for self-preservation, as clinging to it risks losing one's true self. However, ending a deception can lead to alienation from others, as some may react negatively to being tricked.\n\nThe play particularly examines the challenges of gender role reversal through disguise. A central question arises: why would someone choose to adopt the identity of the opposite gender? In Viola's case, this decision stems from self-protection in an unfamiliar land.  \n\nAlthough her disguise provides safety, it isolates her from female companionship and creates a complex web of mistaken identities and emotions. Olivia, believing Viola to be male (Cesario), falls in love with her, while Viola herself develops suppressed feelings for Orsino. This situation highlights how deception can inadvertently expose hidden desires and complexities within characters.\n\nWhile Olivia's attraction to Cesario might initially seem progressive, it could also be interpreted as a satirical commentary on societal norms and superficial judgments. Her swift shift of affection from Cesario to Sebastian, followed by her acceptance of Viola as a sister, underscores this point.",
            "German colonialism is often remembered for its brutality, particularly the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa. However, this simplistic view overlooks the diversity of German colonial policies and practices across its vast empire.  Education, for instance, varied greatly. When Britain took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a significant number of educated Africans. Similarly, German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies received praise from contemporaries. \n\nIn stark contrast, South West Africa (present-day Namibia) saw a different approach. Unlike East Africa, where the government actively established schools and promoted education for natives, South West Africa's education was largely left to missionary societies with minimal government support. The German government, however, heavily invested in educating Europeans, establishing state schools and providing substantial backing to missionary institutions. These policies had a lasting impact on South West Africa, even after German rule ended. While other German colonies boasted literate and educated African populations, South West Africa saw the majority of its people remain uneducated and illiterate. This disparity can be attributed to a complex interplay of social, political, and economic factors, which this paper aims to explore in detail, focusing particularly on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nExisting research on education in the German colonial empire, primarily in German from the early 20th century, often focuses on describing the features of each colony's educational system. Later English-language works have expanded this discourse with comparative studies and deeper analyses of specific aspects of education, highlighting significant differences across colonies. Notably, Cohen's study comparing education in South West Africa and East Africa offers a valuable framework for understanding the factors behind their contrasting educational landscapes. Cohen argues that the substantial settler population in South West Africa played a key role in shaping the colony's unique educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa, with its  temperate climate (despite its arid deserts), attracted a relatively large European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided there, significantly more than the 5,336 in East Africa, the colony with the second-largest settler population.",
            "The vast and ever-expanding landscape of popular music has seen a proliferation of genres over the past century, making it nearly impossible to list them all comprehensively. Each genre, from rap and rock to country and jazz, has spawned numerous subgenres, creating a complex and interconnected web of musical styles. Among these, heavy metal rock has emerged as one of the most diverse and expressive genres in the past 40 years. Its emotional range, often leaning towards the darker aspects of the human experience, and its remarkable adaptability, which has led to countless subgenres and sub-subgenres, contribute to its incredible diversity.\n\nThe sheer number of heavy metal niches today makes it challenging to define precisely what constitutes heavy metal. It has absorbed influences from various genres, yet its origins remain crucial to understanding its evolution. To truly grasp the multifaceted world of metal music, one must first delve into the origins of the metal movement itself, recognizing its unique characteristics and cultural impact.\n\nMetal, in essence, is a movement defined by its intensity and embrace of the darker aspects of human experience. It often features amplified volume, powerful bass lines, and a theatricality that sets it apart. Technical proficiency is highly valued in metal bands, showcasing their mastery of their instruments. \n\nThe movement has also been significantly influenced by drug culture, particularly the psychedelic boom of the mid-1970s. This era saw artists experimenting with drugs, resulting in music that explored unconventional and often unsettling themes. Metal's embrace of darkness and visceral emotions was a departure from the prevailing trends in popular music, offering a new perspective on the spectrum of human emotions. Later generations of metal musicians drew inspiration from the Romantic era's emphasis on dark and intense themes, further shaping the genre's aesthetic.\n\nThe Beatles' song \"Helter Skelter,\" often cited as a precursor to heavy metal, exemplifies the movement's darker side. Its chaotic and unsettling lyrics, possibly reflecting the impact of drug use, showcase a departure from the band's typical style. This song, a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier musical direction, demonstrated the Beatles' willingness to explore darker musical territory.",
            "Several decades before the Surrealists explored dreamlike imagery in their art, Henri Rousseau, a Post-Impressionist painter, was meticulously crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. His 1910 painting, \"The Dream,\" depicts a woman marveling at the wonders of her dreamland, but it also reflects Rousseau's own aspirations as an artist. Throughout his career, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and praise from the art world, facing a difficult internal conflict in pursuing this goal. \"The Dream\" encapsulates Rousseau's lifelong struggle: to conform to prevailing artistic styles to gain acceptance from the art community he admired, or to remain creatively independent and forge his own path.\n\nUnderstanding \"The Dream\" requires some familiarity with Rousseau's life. Born in 1844 in France, he received no formal art training and worked as a toll collector for the French government until he was forty. The loss of his wife and eight infant children deeply affected him, prompting him to find solace and a new beginning through painting. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized peasants in their art, Rousseau, a self-taught artist, captured the hopes and dreams of the ordinary working class.\n\nRousseau's desire for recognition was understandable given his circumstances. He started painting later in life, lacked formal training, and was working alongside many established and talented artists like Matisse. While both artists were contemporaries, their motivations were different, as noted by art historian Jan Gordon. Matisse feared creating conventional art, while Rousseau sought to produce something so traditional that he would be accepted into the prestigious \"Artiste Français\" society.",
            "Many philosophers have recognized a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, believing truth and beauty are intertwined.  This connection stems from the fact that our understanding of ethics and aesthetics isn't solely based on education or experience, as Keats suggests in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn.\"  Instead, these concepts are more about describing than prescribing. We strive to explain what makes art beautiful or an action moral, rather than establishing rigid rules for creation or judgment.\n\nFurthermore, critiquing art or morality often falls short of capturing their true essence. Describing the technical elements of a masterpiece like the Mona Lisa, for example, doesn't fully explain its artistic merit. We often find ourselves saying \"There's just something about it\" when asked about our favorite art or literature, acknowledging that something transcends mere description.\n\nSimilarly, ethics seems to possess this ineffable quality. Like Flannery O'Connor states, stories convey truths that words alone cannot express. No matter how meticulously we analyze a work of literature, there remains a transcendent element. Wittgenstein echoes this sentiment, suggesting ethics is transcendental and cannot be fully articulated.  \n\nI believe this \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, is the most compelling aspect of both art and morality. This shared transcendental nature forms a bridge between them. \n\nBoth ethics and art impact us profoundly on a noumenal level, a realm beyond rational explanation. This connection is particularly strong in literary art, as McKean points out. Literature's inherent moral quality distinguishes it from other art forms.  Literature's relevance stems from the values it reflects, mirroring the values inherent in life itself.",
            "Germany is renowned today as a powerful and unified nation, boasting a distinct culture that spans from the Bavarian Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This cultural identity is palpable in cities like Cologne on the Rhine River, weaving its way through the heart of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River. Given this unique heritage, it's unsurprising that modern Germany emerged from a confluence of diverse tribes and influences. \n\nThe ancestral homeland of the Germans is known as Germania. The origin of this name is hotly debated among scholars and historians. Tacitus, a Roman historian, suggested it derived from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were known as Germans before crossing the Rhine to clash with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98).  Julius Caesar, in his account of the Gallic Wars, first used the term \"Germanus\" to differentiate between the conquered Gauls and the unconquered Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine, often under deceptive pretenses (Caesar, 50-40 BC). He borrowed the word from the Gauls themselves. Some believe it referred to a neighboring people in the Gaulish language. Caesar himself wrote in the first book of his Gallic Wars: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC).  Other theories suggest the name originates from the spear used in Germanic warfare, known as a \"ger\" (O.E.D, 2010), or from the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" hinting at the Germans' perceived loudness or boisterousness (\"Names of Germany\").\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" explored the origins of the Germans, stating: “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?” (Tacitus, 98).\n\nWhile the Romans did engage in campaigns and trade with Germanic tribes, they largely avoided permanently settling in Germania. As Germanic tribes emerged in the first century AD, they resided on the borders of the Roman Empire, exchanging goods and contributing their skills by serving in the Roman army (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "I stared down, my mind processing the scene before me in a detached, analytical way. Thoughts flitted in and out, too quickly to form coherent ideas. It felt like my consciousness was simply observing, without any real emotional engagement.  \n\nI had once tried to improve my drawing skills by following the instructions in a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" It taught about how the brain interprets lines and suggested a technique of focusing on a single element by mentally framing it. \n\nThis time, however, I felt overwhelmed by the situation. I was struck by the sheer magnitude of the task, like facing the start of a grand artistic project.  \n\nMy hand, trembling slightly, reached for the toilet brush, attempting to channel my creativity into this mundane task.  The water swirled, clean and serene, as I tried to work through the initial shock. But the stubborn object refused to budge, stuck like a stubborn lump.  \n\nWith a sigh, I gripped the mop and stared at the mess, a symbol of someone else's carelessness. The green tie around my neck felt like a tightrope walker’s rope, constricting my spirit.",
            "Teenage drivers are involved in a disproportionately high number of fatal car accidents. This issue stems from a combination of factors, including the underdeveloped nature of the teen brain, lack of experience, and the influence of peers. Studies show that teen drivers, especially those with younger passengers, are more likely to be involved in crashes. \n\nWhile some states have implemented provisional licenses with restrictions on driving hours and passenger limits, these measures are seen as temporary solutions. The core problem is that young drivers, statistically, are not yet equipped to handle the complexities and risks associated with driving. Experts suggest that the urge for thrill-seeking common among teenagers contributes to this danger. \n\nRaising the driving age to at least 18 could significantly reduce accidents.  A potential legislative solution involves maintaining driver's education in schools but prohibiting anyone under 18 from obtaining a license.  Provisional permits and supervised practice hours could still be implemented, with the number of hours aligned with current state requirements.  \n\nNational legislation on this issue would ensure consistent safety standards across the country and effectively protect young lives.",
            "My analysis of fifteen trick films produced by Edison between 1895 and 1901, housed in the Library of Congress, focused on their visual storytelling techniques and evolutionary developments.  These films primarily rely on creative editing to create illusions, adhering to a set of conventions typical of early cinema. \n\nThese conventions include a fixed camera position within a frontal proscenium, resembling a stage setup, with no camera movement to follow action.  This framing style, borrowed from theatre and vaudeville, often restricts movement to side-to-side, as seen in films like \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900).\n\nAs a result, shots tend to be long or medium shots, with close-ups absent, mirroring the theatrical tradition of presenting the entire performance within the stage's boundaries. The one-shot-equals-one-film approach, prevalent in early cinema, limits the films to a minute or less and often focuses on short, vaudeville-style tricks rather than elaborate narratives. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that a single \"shot\" in these films may actually encompass multiple physically filmed sequences edited together to create illusions like apparitions or disappearances.  For example, \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) appears as a single shot but reveals a separate filming sequence for Mary's severed \"head.\"",
            "John Taylor, a fervent early supporter of Republicanism, viewed his agricultural background and brief political career as shaping his commitment to individualism and limited government. His agrarian ideals heavily influenced his political stances on sovereignty, constitutional interpretation, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed the U.S. had a unique opportunity to establish an ideal government free from traditional constraints, emphasizing self-governance and the inherent rights of man. He stressed the interconnectedness of these rights, arguing that the infringement of one diminishes the value of all. These rights, he believed, should be protected from governmental encroachment.  He perceived the \"state of nature\" as favoring the physically strong and cunning, and sought to prevent this power imbalance in a civilized society.\n\nTo realize this ideal, Taylor advocated for a government that acknowledged both the good and evil inherent in humanity. He held a rigid dualistic view of morality, believing that government, being human-driven, inevitably reflects both virtues and vices. He defined good principles as those that safeguard private property, promote agriculture, and limit capitalism, arguing that such a government would function fairly regardless of its administration, which he acknowledged would be susceptible to self-interest. While recognizing self-interest as a fundamental human motive, he deemed it detrimental when it prioritized personal gain over the public good, leading to societal divisions. A strong government was necessary to contain this inherent evil, but it too must be closely monitored to prevent the adoption of harmful principles.\n\nLike many Republican contemporaries, Taylor championed a strict interpretation of the Constitution, advocating for a limited federal government with powers explicitly outlined therein. He feared the expense and potential for despotism associated with a larger federal entity. However, he cautioned against a purely literal interpretation, emphasizing the importance of understanding the framers' intentions. Furthermore, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true foundational document of the United States, as it more clearly articulated the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than a unified entity.",
            "The project observed a sharp decline in commuter log submissions during the third month, a trend that was concerning. Several factors might have contributed to this, including the onset of winter, the end of the fall semester, and the holiday season, all of which likely led to reduced campus presence. Additionally, it's possible that the initial enthusiasm for the project naturally waned over time. To address this, a \"Carpool Challenge Week\" was launched in March, boosting log submissions. This highlights a key challenge: sustaining project momentum amidst natural engagement fluctuations and seasonal breaks common in higher education.\n\nAnother hurdle was overcoming the deeply ingrained cultural preference for driving.  To encourage alternative commuting, various prizes were offered, including gift certificates to local businesses. While these incentives were effective initially, the authors speculate that larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars, might have further incentivized participation and mitigated the decline. They also suggest that escalating the value of prizes throughout the project, potentially by announcing larger rewards later on, could have been more effective.",
            "An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of investment security designed to mirror the performance of a specific index, commodity, or basket of assets, similar to an index fund. ETFs offer the diversification benefits of index funds while providing the flexibility to trade like individual stocks, allowing investors to engage in activities like short selling, margin trading, and purchasing fractional shares.  \n\nOne significant advantage of ETFs is their lower expense ratios compared to traditional mutual funds. However, investors should be aware that ETFs incur trading commissions, similar to stock transactions. Additionally, while ETFs boast a wide range of investment options, it's crucial for investors to critically assess the claimed benefits, such as diversification, to ensure they align with their investment goals. \n\nThis analysis focuses on ETF IHF and compares its performance to the top 10 holdings, which collectively account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. By examining these holdings, we aim to determine whether owning the ETF provides comparable benefits to owning a diversified portfolio of these individual stocks and explore potential alternative stock configurations that might yield a more optimal risk-adjusted return (measured by the Sharpe ratio).\n\nTo streamline the evaluation, we'll concentrate on the top 10 holdings. We'll calculate the contribution of each stock to the portfolio's beta and return, assuming the portfolio replicates the ETF's asset allocation.\n\nPreliminary findings indicate that a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings could potentially deliver a higher return (6.11%) with a lower beta (0.12) compared to the ETF. However, further statistical analysis is needed to confirm if these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTherefore, we'll calculate the standard deviation of each top 10 stock and normalize it to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation against the ETF IHF's standard deviation.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" one of his finest poems. In it, he uses the term \"Thulé,\" which he likely borrowed from both Virgil and the German author Goethe. While Virgil used \"Thulé\" to describe a mythical island beyond the known world, Poe's use of the term echoes the themes and characters in Goethe's poem \"The King of Thulé.\"  This connection is highlighted by literary scholars who see similarities between the mournful king in Goethe's poem and the speaker in Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" both grappling with loss and a sense of desolation.  \n\nPoe's familiarity with Goethe's work is further supported by his admiration for Tennyson, a poet who was heavily influenced by Goethe. Given Poe's respect for Tennyson and the wide availability of Goethe's works during Poe's time, it's plausible that Poe drew inspiration from \"The King of Thulé\" when crafting \"Dream-Land.\" Both poems explore themes of grief, isolation, and the allure of a shadowy, dreamlike realm.",
            "Could a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a California grocery store be awarded punitive damages if the store manager was informed about the spill twice but chose to ignore it for half an hour while eating dinner?  A judge is unlikely to immediately dismiss the customer's claim for punitive damages. To justify such an award, the customer must demonstrate that the manager's actions were intentional disregard for the potential harm, as well as highly reprehensible. The customer can argue that the manager should have known the risk of not cleaning the spill because multiple customers had slipped and fallen in similar incidents in the past. While the argument that the manager's actions were despicable might be less convincing, it is still reasonable considering the history of slip-and-fall incidents at the store.\n\nThe incident occurred on October 13, 2009, when two employees notified the manager, Paul Martin, about the applesauce spill. Martin, however, dismissed their concerns, citing his dinner break. Despite being informed twice, Martin failed to address the spill, and an hour later, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell, sustaining a serious back injury.  \n\nIn California, punitive damages can be awarded in cases where a defendant's actions involved oppression, fraud, or malice. Malice is defined as intentional harm or conduct that, lacking intent, is \"despicable\" and shows a deliberate disregard for others' safety. Courts have ruled that conduct can be considered malicious when a person is aware of the potential dangers of their actions and willingly chooses to ignore them.",
            "Four years ago, I took an Islam course at CBC where we debated whether Islam is inherently hostile. This question feels even more crucial today. Since 9/11, I've witnessed the media shift from a hostile stance towards Islam to excessive tolerance.  It's hard to imagine a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with his Muslim family background, running in 2001.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography intrigues me because it contradicts my previous understanding. I believed Muhammad forcibly converted people through conquest, but the biography portrays him as a misunderstood martyr who humbly led others to his teachings.\n\nInterestingly, there are parallels between Muhammad's ministry and Jesus' miracles, such as the story of multiplying food. This style of writing suggests an attempt to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, potentially diminishing the significance of Jesus' miracles.\n\nThe biography also relies heavily on third-party accounts, which I find questionable. While intended to demonstrate the authenticity of the stories, this reliance on hearsay weakens their credibility.\n\nUltimately, what bothers me most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly, humble, and wise figure while historical evidence suggests otherwise. I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "Christian thought has significantly diverged from Jesus' original teachings since his life.  This trend towards increasing distance from the source is apparent throughout history. While traditionalists resist change, their influence is likely to diminish as the world becomes more progressive. A growing awareness of this historical evolution will lead Christians in the future to yearn for a return to the core teachings of Jesus. Over decades or centuries, this desire will manifest as a movement stripping away layers of doctrine added over time, ultimately returning Christianity to its original form. This movement, driven by a desire to rediscover Jesus' true message, will sweep through the United States and Europe, unifying Christians in belief and practice across denominations and divisions.  \n\nThis historical trend, similar to past reversals such as the Roman Empire's transformation from persecutor to Christian institution, will see a return to uniformity in Christianity.  \n\nUnderstanding this evolution requires viewing Jesus' words metaphorically, rather than literally.  \n\nTracing the roots of Christianity reveals its origins in Judaism, a religion centered on monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures.  Even before Roman control of Jerusalem in 63 BCE, Judaism itself was diverse, with various groups like Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general populace.",
            "Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\" exposes the inherent greed and self-centeredness of humanity, particularly within the context of industrial capitalism. The novel depicts factory owners and managers as ruthless individuals driven solely by profit maximization, disregarding the well-being of their employees and the environment. Sinclair vividly portrays the stark contrast between the opulence of the factory owners and the squalid living and working conditions of the workers.\n\nThe imagery of \"the line of buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\" highlights the destructive industrial pollution and the callous indifference of the owners towards its consequences.  They prioritize financial gain over human life, symbolized by the \"great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories\" and the unchecked waste from the surrounding animal pens.\n\nThe novel also exposes the exploitative labor practices prevalent in Packingtown. The owners exploit their employees through long hours, unsafe working conditions, and arbitrary layoffs without any safety nets or support. The absence of worker protections allows the owners to treat their employees as expendable commodities, valuing profit above human dignity.  Sinclair uses the phrase \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\" to emphasize the dehumanizing nature of the system.\n\nThe workers, trapped in a cycle of poverty and exploitation, are likened to slaves, highlighting the stark parallels between the conditions in Packingtown and the horrors of chattel slavery.  Their lack of agency and the absence of support systems further emphasize the systemic injustice they face.",
            "Authors employ various techniques to evoke specific feelings or perspectives in readers regarding significant themes. F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully utilizes several of these techniques in his novel *The Great Gatsby*. One notable technique is his unconventional pairing of adjectives and nouns to create a particular aura around certain subjects. Fitzgerald also imbues symbolism with meaning, using colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink to achieve this purpose. In *The Great Gatsby*, he builds layers of meaning around white/gray, associating them with uniformity. White represents a more refined and elevated class, while gray denotes an older, faded quality.  \n\nFitzgerald establishes this meaning early on through consistent use of these colors. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are constantly depicted in white, signifying their social standing and perhaps a sense of superficiality. This prevalence of white extends to other characters and settings, emphasizing the pervasive nature of this association. In contrast, Fitzgerald uses gray to describe less significant elements, suggesting a sense of banality or insignificance.  He uses these colors to color everyday objects and people, reinforcing the established meanings. \n\nBy repeatedly associating white/gray with specific themes, Fitzgerald later utilizes them to convey a sense of unimportance or uniformity in relation to certain characters and objects. This technique is particularly evident in his portrayal of Daisy. After a period of limited use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy in a \"white roadster,\" subtly diminishing her characterization and presenting her as more of an object of desire for Gatsby.  Further instances of Daisy's description in white and gray reinforce this impression, highlighting her perceived conformity and lack of depth.",
            "San Diego County's favorable climate makes it ideal for agriculture, with popular crops including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a strong demand for organic produce, leading to long waiting lists for community supported agriculture (CSA) programs. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms offer tours, hiking trails, birdwatching opportunities, and other recreational activities, demonstrating how farming can combine profit with environmental stewardship. \n\nOne potential strategy for landowners is to utilize government programs to support organic farming practices that benefit both profitability and wildlife habitats. Organic farming, while often more labor-intensive and potentially less efficient than conventional methods, promotes biodiversity and reduces chemical use.  Additional practices, such as cover cropping, rotational grazing, invasive species removal, and habitat management, can further enhance wildlife benefits but may also increase labor costs. \n\nThis example focuses on a 160-acre parcel near Potrero, California, encompassing chaparral, grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This area is crucial due to its location within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, which is part of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This plan aims to protect over a hundred species, including endangered ones like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and mountain yellow-legged frog. \n\nThe land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries, followed by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. \n\nBy researching government programs and examining successful organic farms in the region, landowners can explore ways to balance financial viability with ecological conservation efforts.",
            "Culture significantly influences negotiations, shaping interactions and outcomes.  While generalizations about cultures can be tempting, it's crucial to recognize that cultures are complex and diverse.  Instead of relying on stereotypes, negotiators should strive to understand the specific cultural values and norms at play in each situation. This involves appreciating how these cultural elements might impact communication styles, decision-making processes, and overall negotiation strategies.\n\nApproaching unfamiliar cultures with an open mind and a willingness to learn is essential.  Understanding a culture's history, perspectives, and potential biases can help bridge cultural gaps and foster productive discussions.  Respecting traditions and beliefs, particularly when in a weaker bargaining position, can pave the way for successful negotiations.\n\nFurthermore, it's important to remember that culture extends beyond national boundaries. Companies often develop their own distinct cultures, influencing everything from work hours and dress codes to communication styles and philanthropic practices. Recognizing these internal cultural variations within organizations adds another layer of complexity to the negotiating landscape.\n\nValues lie at the heart of a culture, providing insights into its motivations and priorities.  For example, a culture that values saving face might prioritize avoiding public humiliation, while a culture that emphasizes competitiveness might be more inclined to push for a favorable outcome.  \n\nUltimately, successful negotiation requires a combination of cultural awareness, respect for individual differences, and a willingness to adapt one's approach accordingly.",
            "This essay analyzes the arguments of St. Anselm and St. Thomas Aquinas for the existence of God. Both philosophers assume the existence of the God of the Bible, focusing on their distinct approaches to proving His presence. Anselm emphasizes faith and introspection, arguing that God's existence is inherently known within our minds. He believes that the very concept of God necessitates His existence, making empirical evidence unnecessary. In contrast, Aquinas relies solely on reason and observable evidence, presenting five logical arguments – change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony – to demonstrate God's logical necessity.  \n\nWhile both provide compelling arguments, the essay questions whether either fully establishes a comprehensive basis for belief in God. Anselm's reliance on faith may not satisfy those seeking concrete proof, while Aquinas's arguments, while logical, rely on assumptions that may be debated.",
            "Around the 5th or 6th century BCE, a prince who later became known as Buddha was born. He renounced worldly possessions, achieved enlightenment, and his teachings gave rise to Buddhism. The most traditional branch of Buddhism, Theravada Buddhism, is approximately 2,500 years old. Over time, it has evolved significantly from its original form. This evolution is evident in various aspects, such as the annual water-cutting ceremony in Sri Lanka, a Theravada Buddhist nation. This ceremony, involving both monks and lay people, holds religious significance despite Buddha not mentioning any such festivity during his lifetime. These changes encompass both external practices and core theological principles. The Theravada Buddhist community, both monastic and lay, has adapted its doctrines over time due to both internal and external influences, both positive and negative.\n\nThis discussion will frequently use specific terms: \"internal\" and \"external\" forces. An \"internal force\" originates from members of the Buddhist community, regardless of their monastic status. An \"external force\" comes from non-Buddhist sources.  A \"hostile force\" aims to damage or harm the Buddhist community, stemming from a negative perception of Buddhism. A \"benign force,\" on the other hand, does not intend to harm or help the community, but its actions may have unintended consequences. These terms will be recurring throughout the analysis.\n\nUnderstanding the core doctrines of Theravada Buddhism is crucial. Buddhists seek refuge in the \"triple gem\": the Buddha, the Dhamma (teachings), and the Sangha (community). The Dhamma encompasses the Tripitaka—the three baskets of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains the discourses of Buddha, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. Key metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these concepts is essential to ending Sansara (the cycle of death and rebirth) and achieving enlightenment. Along with Sansara, desires (lobha), hatred (dosa), and delusion (moha) cease. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for conduct. Laypeople adhere to five precepts (non-killing, non-lying, non-stealing, non-sexual misconduct, and abstaining from intoxicants), while monks follow a more extensive set of monastic rules.  The foundational principle in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, Dukkha—life is inherently suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico experienced a long-standing rivalry from 1836 to 1893, marked by numerous conflicts and tensions. The rivalry reached its peak during the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), where the U.S. emerged victorious, gaining Texas and the American Southwest.  This rivalry, rooted in differences in religion, culture, and competing economic interests, mirrored similar tensions between neighboring nations. As David M. Pletcher observed, the U.S. faced enduring diplomatic challenges primarily with Mexico and Cuba, both geographically close and historically rivals. \n\nReligious differences, particularly anti-Catholic sentiment among Americans, further fueled the animosity, echoing the ideological struggles of the Cold War. This distrust stemmed from the historical rivalry between England and Spain, their former colonial rulers.\n\nDuring this 57-year period, 17 disputes arose, primarily concerning territorial issues and border skirmishes. Banditry and outlaws operating across the border were a constant problem until both nations increased their military presence along the frontier.\n\nBy the late 19th century, Mexico's economic dependence on the U.S. and a shift in American interests from territorial expansion to economic influence in Mexico gradually lessened the rivalry.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was unexpectedly disabled by an illness I had never encountered before.  As a nurse, I had chosen my profession for the stability and security I lacked as a child, believing that healthcare was a reliable source of employment. While my true passions lay in science and journalism, I ultimately settled for nursing. However, at the age of 46 and single, I found myself without savings and unable to work due to my disability. After 15 years on Social Security Disability, I have depleted my resources and face daily struggles that threaten my security, safety, and self-esteem. Despite the uncertainty in my life, one certainty remains: I wouldn't have survived these years without the support of my family and close friends, proving that even the strongest individuals need help during times of crisis.\n\nLife inevitably throws curveballs, both big and small.  Despite careful planning, some challenges are too overwhelming to handle alone.  \n\nWhile I agree that we should be wary of relying solely on government assistance, I believe Americans need to rediscover the importance of community and mutual support.  Rather than isolating ourselves in self-sufficiency, we should learn to trust and help one another.  \n\nThe American ideal of \"rugged individualism\" often overshadows the truth: our ancestors persevered not solely through individual strength, but through compassion, respect, and shared resources.  The pioneers who journeyed westward relied on each other to survive.\n\nTherefore, be prepared for emergencies.  Stock up on supplies like a disaster kit, first aid, water purification tablets, and non-perishable food.  If possible, consider gardening or having a wood stove.  But equally important is building strong connections with your neighbors.",
            "The evolution of organisms and the factors that shape their development are complex questions that scientists continue to explore. While fully understanding these processes remains a challenge, mathematical modeling has emerged as a valuable tool for investigating evolutionary and developmental change.  \n\nThis study focuses on the application of mathematical modeling to the evolution of shell morphology in the mollusk genus *Prunum*. By combining mathematical models with experimental observations and traditional descriptive studies, researchers aim to decipher the mechanisms driving changes in shell shape and size over evolutionary time. \n\nTo achieve this, the researchers used X-ray images of *Prunum* species to quantify shell features and create digital models. These models were then used to simulate hypothetical shell morphologies, helping to define the potential range of evolutionary possibilities. The findings from these modeling exercises are being integrated with experimental and descriptive data to gain a more comprehensive understanding of macroevolutionary trends in this group of mollusks.\n\n\nThe study highlights the unique nature of shells, describing them as three-dimensional structures that develop through a series of coiled whorls spiraling around a central axis known as the columella. The size and shape of these whorls, along with the sutures separating them, contribute to the overall form of the shell. The researchers also discuss different ways of viewing and analyzing shells, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. \n\nUltimately, the researchers view shell development as a series of apertures moving through space and time as the organism grows. By tracing the path of these apertures mathematically, they hope to uncover the underlying principles governing shell morphogenesis.",
            "Despite progress in areas like water and sanitation, Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have remained stagnant for the past decade.  While the country is striving to meet the Millennium Development Goals, significant improvements in child and maternal health are lacking to achieve the 2015 targets.  This stagnation highlights the need to strengthen the overall health system rather than relying solely on targeted programs.\n\nAlthough the percentage of births attended by skilled health workers has increased to 72%, this figure includes traditional practitioners who may not be equipped to handle complications, contributing to high maternal mortality rates due to hemorrhage.  Furthermore, the decline in the percentage of children under five treated for diarrhea by healthcare professionals is concerning.  Data on postnatal care is limited but suggests a need for improvement across the country.\n\nCesarean section rates remain low at 4%, with a stark disparity between urban (7%) and rural (2%) areas, underscoring inequalities in healthcare access.  The gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles (27%) further emphasizes the challenges faced by low-income communities in accessing healthcare, likely due to financial constraints.\n\nMoving forward, Indonesia faces a critical question: should it focus on specific programs or strengthen the entire health system? While targeted programs offer quick results and manageable objectives, they can divert resources from other areas and lead to duplication of services.  Investing heavily in one sector can also result in a brain drain, as skilled personnel gravitate towards areas with more funding, as seen with the impact of HIV/AIDS funding on family planning programs.",
            "Victorian novels are typically known for their meticulous attention to detail and focus on the aristocracy. However, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" while considered Victorian novels, deviate from this trend. Both incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, which is uncommon in novels of that era. This stylistic choice strengthens the characters by providing deeper insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\nAn example of this can be seen in a passage from \"Oliver Twist\": \"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\"  \n\nThe novels often utilize mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the content and purpose vary in each case. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these strange occurrences often reveal insights into Oliver's inner turmoil, his suffering, and his understanding of the true nature of events around him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he relives the experience vividly, as if in a dream, while struggling to find help. The passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the unfolding events and the dire state of his health, evident in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing his senses as he doesn't notice the \"unseen hand\" carrying him away. He experiences his despair anew, detached from the initial shock of pain, as the pain becomes a constant, linked to fear rather than surprise.  Oliver's helplessness raises the question of whose will orchestrated his misfortune, as it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the idea that Oliver has little control over his life, unable to even attempt to influence the outcome of an event, even when his life is in danger. The passage also suggests a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if Fagin has broken him, forcing him to accept this despair and hindering his ability to react. Otherwise, it is reasonable to assume Oliver would have made some effort, at least to save himself.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.\"",
            "A few years ago, while working as a tutor in an after-school program for elementary students, I noticed a peculiar reading challenge with a third or fourth-grade boy named Adrian. Despite speaking perfect English, he struggled with pronunciation, understanding some letters perfectly while others were completely foreign to him. His Latino heritage led me to believe his first language was Spanish.  \n\nThe situation became clearer when Adrian's mother, who only spoke Spanish, arrived during a field trip.  With my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate, and it dawned on me that Adrian wasn't necessarily reading poorly, but rather lacked a strong grasp of the English alphabet. \n\nThis experience highlighted the complexities of language barriers in schools, particularly in California.  Even for students who speak English fluently, reading can pose significant obstacles. While tutoring Adrian in English phonics and alphabet recognition proved helpful in his case, the challenges faced by children with limited English proficiency are much more multifaceted.\n\nEffective solutions require a multi-pronged approach. Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes all have their merits, but no single solution is sufficient. Combining these approaches is crucial.\n\nDual language programs offer significant benefits for all children, not just those whose first language is Spanish. Research shows that students in these programs often outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns about resource allocation and lack of benefit for the majority, widespread implementation of dual language programs would benefit all students.\n\nWhile requiring all teachers to be bilingual might be unrealistic, incorporating bilingual aids or tutors could effectively support language learning.",
            "From a young age, many of us are taught about a higher power, something beyond our understanding. Some seek answers in organized religion, while others explore spirituality within themselves.  We often adopt the beliefs of our upbringing, but some reject them entirely, focusing solely on their own experiences. Our perspectives on spirituality evolve over time, leading us on a personal journey to find meaning and guidance in life.  We yearn for light amidst darkness, seeking a path to enlightenment.\n\nThe story then shifts to a poignant moment shared between a father and child. The father, facing his own mortality, reflects on life while listening to the rain. The son, sensing his father's fragility, feels a deep sense of loss and struggles to express his emotions. They sit together in silence, united by their shared experience.\n\nTragically, the father passes away shortly after, leaving his son grappling with grief and questioning his faith. He feels abandoned by a God who seemingly ignores his pleas. The son chooses to avoid witnessing his father's death, honoring his belief that his father wouldn't want him to be a passive observer. He retreats into solitude, waiting for news of his father's passing.  The indifference of those around him adds to his feelings of isolation and pain.",
            "The Gothic novel is a paradoxical blend of old and new, as literary scholar Ian Watt aptly describes it. It has been both criticized and celebrated, sometimes dismissed as superficial and other times lauded for its evocative \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" considered the first Gothic novel, skillfully merges elements of ancient and modern romances to establish a new literary style. Walpole combines traditional theatrical elements with the more intimate, psychologically driven style of modern novels, creating what he calls \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). \n\nThe Gothic genre draws heavily on medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, even though the term \"Gothic\" itself was often used disparagingly at the time, associated with archaism and lack of sophistication compared to the perceived advancements of the modern era. The unique fusion of the theatrical \"Gothic\" with the novel's ability to delve into characters' inner lives contributes to the genre's enduring appeal, allowing it to remain both timeless and strangely novel to readers across generations.\n\nA key concept in Gothic novels is chivalry, reflecting the medieval ideal of knightly training.  Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, often romanticize this concept because it represents the epitome of bravery, honor, and competence—qualities they believed were lacking in contemporary society. By resurrecting chivalric ideals, they implicitly critique the present and yearn for a return to a perceived golden age. Walpole, writing during a time of political turmoil and personal accusations, may have felt a particular sense of disillusionment with modern society, leading him to romanticize the supposed morality and inherent goodness of the past. This sentiment is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits: he is a prince, a tragic figure, and is believed to have been killed by enemies. This idealized portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" (66) foreshadows the Gothic trope of exaggeration and excess.",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the intricate processes involved in moving goods from a customer's order through every stage, including raw materials, supply, production, and distribution, until the product reaches the customer.  Coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, this term highlights the strategic planning, execution, and monitoring of these processes to meet customer needs efficiently and promptly.\n\nSix key elements form the backbone of a successful supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Businesses leverage these elements to deliver exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction, the initial stage, lays the groundwork for the entire supply chain. It involves defining the \"when,\" \"why,\" \"where,\" and \"how\" of production.  Understanding customer demand is paramount, and market analysis serves as a vital indicator. By scrutinizing market trends, managers can determine customer preferences and make informed decisions about product types and quantities.  \n\nOnce production scope is determined, managers identify the optimal production location, considering factors like volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. Determining production schedules and equipment maintenance fall under this stage.  Careful planning at each stage is crucial, as any oversight can lead to significant time and financial losses.  \n\nThe second key element is supply, encompassing strategic decisions regarding core facility capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Companies often have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with distinct equipment, workforce, and specializations. Managers must strategically allocate tasks among these divisions or consider outsourcing to external companies. Outsourcing aims to enhance velocity, achieving quality, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.",
            "Ellen Page, known for her role in the film \"Juno,\" holds a sign on a street corner that reads, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" The sign highlights the ongoing oppression in Myanmar (formerly Burma), a Southeast Asian nation ruled by a military junta that seized power in 1962. \n\nIn 2007, a series of protests, known as the \"Saffron Revolution,\" erupted led by Buddhist monks who were demanding democratic reforms. Initially peaceful, the protests were met with brutal force by the military. Journalists were imprisoned, and some, like Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai, were killed. Despite official claims of limited casualties, defectors from the military suggest the death toll was significantly higher.\n\nThis pattern of government suppression of dissent is not unique to Myanmar. Throughout history, regimes have sought to maintain absolute control, from ancient Roman emperors claiming divine authority to the current U.S. president's alleged meetings with the leader of a fictional group.\n\nExamples of such atrocities include the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in China, where the government violently suppressed student-led protests, and the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s, where Hutu extremists, with government support, systematically killed Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The Holocaust, perpetrated by Nazi Germany, stands as a horrific example of state-sanctioned genocide against Jews.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring legacy in jazz stems from his long career and his exceptional ability to shape his orchestra. Although his piano playing is often understated in his compositions, Ellington was a masterful composer who created intricate and vibrant pieces that showcased the individual talents of his band members. He meticulously crafted musical frameworks that allowed for improvisation while also composing tightly arranged sections and phrases that highlighted the unique styles of each musician. This attention to detail contributed to the distinct and original tonal qualities of his orchestra, making each piece unique and coherent. Ellington's deep understanding of his musicians' individual sounds and how they blended together as an ensemble enabled him to compose some of the most innovative and brilliant works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative use of voice as a \"jazz instrument\" throughout his career, citing \"Creole Love Call\" as an early example.  This piece demonstrates Ellington's ability to use voice for added texture and color without relying on lyrics. It also showcases his talent for complementing the styles of his soloists, a characteristic that permeates his entire body of work.  This slow, bluesy twelve-bar piece, composed of six choruses, features a call-and-response dynamic between voice and reeds, with the voice transitioning from smooth and melodic to rougher towards the end.  A muted trumpet solo follows, elaborating on the melody and emphasizing bluesy notes. A soaring clarinet solo backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase comes next, followed by the full band echoing the first chorus with a call-and-response between brass and reeds. The climactic fifth chorus sees the reeds leading the call-and-response at a higher register, supported by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. The final chorus returns to the structure of the first, with a call-and-response between voice and reeds, this time featuring the voice using a \"growl\" technique, showcasing it as an instrument. The piece concludes with a brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant ending from the trombone.\n\nEllington's innovative use of voice in \"Creole Love Call\" is just one example of the stylistic approach that defines his music.  In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington combines his mastery of orchestration with his keen ear for tonal color. A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing blends the vocal qualities of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice, creating a rich and complementary sound. In \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" Ellington further emphasizes these ideas by featuring Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a mainstay in his orchestra, introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "She had always felt a deep yearning for something she couldn't quite define. This desire began during her teenage years and persisted even at 17. While she yearned for a connection with someone, she found herself uninterested in any boys who showed romantic interest. This lack of romantic inclination puzzled her, leading to much introspection and speculation. Despite her efforts, she couldn't pinpoint the reason for this unusual situation. She continued to navigate life, constantly questioning her desires.\n\nHer family life was usually peaceful. Her parents were calm and rarely argued, and disagreements with their daughter were uncommon. The only area of friction stemmed from her assertive and independent nature, which contrasted with their more subdued personalities.  Despite this, her outgoing and friendly disposition made her well-liked.\n\nHowever, this day was anything but ordinary. As she searched for inspiration, a scream from the kitchen startled her. Racing to her mother's aid, she found her lying on the floor in pain. Her mother, struggling to speak, managed to tell her daughter she needed to go to the hospital.  Relieved that she had taken self-defense classes, the daughter quickly carried her mother to the car and drove her to the hospital.\n\nThe sterile atmosphere of the hospital was overshadowed by her daughter's anxiety for her mother's well-being. She rushed her mother inside, calling for medical assistance. Doctors and nurses quickly gathered around, taking her mother to be examined. \n\nIt turned out her mother had fallen off a step stool while reaching for a vase on a high shelf.",
            "This study examined the connection between adhering to a modified Mediterranean diet (aMed diet) and the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke-related deaths. The aMed diet emphasizes plant-based foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, and fish, while limiting animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted. \n\nPrevious research suggested a link between a traditional Mediterranean diet and reduced risk of heart disease and mortality. This study, focusing on 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 from the Nurses' Health Study, tracked their dietary habits over 20 years using food frequency questionnaires. \n\nThe researchers calculated a cumulative aMed diet score for each participant, taking into account factors like age, smoking, body mass index, hormone use, physical activity, and other lifestyle factors. They found that women with higher aMed scores had a significantly lower risk of developing CHD and stroke compared to those with lower scores. During the study, 2391 cases of CHD, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular deaths occurred. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a 29% reduced risk of CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile.",
            "The U.S. economy suffered a severe financial crisis in 2007, marked by rising unemployment, a collapsing housing market, and the downfall of major corporations. This recession's ongoing impact compels us to examine its causes and potential solutions.  The crisis stemmed from irresponsible and shortsighted political decisions that encouraged banks and firms to issue subprime loans into an already fragile financial system.  Government entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac further exacerbated the situation by packaging these risky mortgages into complex investments known as CDOs and CDSs.  When borrowers defaulted, banks faced capital shortages and transferred their losses onto these repackaged mortgages, ultimately destabilizing the entire economy.\n\nThe roots of this crisis can be traced back to 1999 during the Clinton administration.  President Clinton, seeking re-election, relaxed lending regulations to boost his popularity, inadvertently setting the stage for the subprime crisis years later.  As reported by the New York Times, Fannie Mae, under pressure from the government and shareholders, aggressively expanded its mortgage lending, a move that was foreseen by journalist Steven Holmes to potentially lead to a government bailout similar to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.  \n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the complex structure of mortgages.  Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs intertwined various sectors of the economy with the housing market, leading to excessive leverage and vulnerability to price fluctuations.  When the housing bubble burst, financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities suffered significant losses.  The crisis had a devastating impact on major investment banks, forcing some, like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, into bankruptcy or government intervention, while others, like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, were forced to restructure as commercial banks under strict regulation.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, also came under government control in 2008.",
            "Exposition, the part of a story where you explain background information, can be tricky. While it's important to give readers context, too much exposition can be boring and make them lose interest. \n\nThink of it like this: instead of simply stating facts about a character, show their personality and history through their actions, words, and interactions with others.  \n\nFor example, instead of saying a character was deeply in love with their husband, describe their loving gestures, conversations, and how their husband's presence made them feel. This creates a stronger emotional connection for the reader and makes the character's grief more impactful when their husband dies.\n\nWhen writing, resist the urge to rush through important details about your characters. Take the time to flesh them out and make them feel real to your readers.",
            "I watched two Columbus, Ohio newscasts on August 13, 2011. The first, NBC 4, featured a brief report on Shad Hostettler, a man who had stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. Details were limited, stating only that she had been stabbed multiple times and he had been arrested. \n\nThe second story involved the shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in Sharon Woods. He was critically injured, and the SWAT team was investigating. I felt this story was short, possibly due to Buyers' race. I've noticed a pattern of media downplaying crimes involving minorities compared to those involving white victims.\n\nThe news also covered a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, likely caused by a .22 caliber rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest. \n\nA short weather update followed, mentioning predicted rain and thunderstorms for the weekend. \n\nA robbery at a UDF on Clime Road was reported, with emphasis given to the robber's race and appearance (a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie). This level of detail regarding his race felt unusual.\n\nFinally, the news covered Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin sentenced to 25 years for marijuana distribution to Ohio.  The unusual phrasing of \"300 months\" instead of years was noted, as well as the mention of his Hispanic ethnicity, which seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "The bond between brothers is unique and unbreakable, encompassing a complex mix of emotions like love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers share a deep understanding that transcends ordinary relationships, seeing a reflection of themselves in each other. This bond is most vividly revealed in times of crisis, revealing its true nature, whether positive or negative.  Comprehending the emotions stemming from this fraternal connection involves accepting the consequences that come with them. Looking into a brother's eyes allows one to see their true self, not how others perceive them, but their genuine essence. Their actions and the repercussions of those actions ultimately define their character.  \n\n\"The Scarlet Ibis\" explores this theme through the relationship between two brothers, highlighting the intense emotions that accompany it. Set against a lush and vivid backdrop, the brothers embark on a doomed journey. The story culminates in a clash between bitter disappointment and intense pride, leaving only one brother alive. The theme is conveyed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with his brother, as well as the narrator's perspective, which reveals the protagonist's complex feelings and his perception of the world around him, both of which heavily influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are primarily driven by pride. From their first outings together to their final, tragic expedition, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He yearned for a brother who could keep up with his aspirations, participating in activities like running, jumping, and climbing. He envisioned a brother who could be his companion in adventures and games.  However, Doodle's physical limitations, due to a weak heart, shattered these dreams. This realization deeply disappointed the protagonist, who even contemplated harming Doodle out of frustration. This dark thought, while fleeting, reveals the depth of his anger and resentment. Yet, Doodle's innocent smile melts the protagonist's anger, showcasing a lingering love beneath the surface.",
            "The human brain is a complex system responsible for processing information in creative ways. As technology has evolved, so too have the metaphors used to describe the brain, progressing from simple comparisons like a wax tablet or papyrus to more sophisticated analogies like a computer. However, it's important to remember that these metaphors have limitations and can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory input, where our senses transform physical stimuli into electrochemical signals. These signals are then processed by the brain through two primary mechanisms: bottom-up and top-down processing. Bottom-up processing analyzes basic elements like color and shape to build a complete understanding, while top-down processing utilizes prior knowledge and expectations to speed up recognition. For example, when viewing a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing identifies the individual components, while top-down processing helps us quickly recognize it as a box based on our existing knowledge.\n\nAttention plays a crucial role in filtering and prioritizing information. While our brain processes a vast amount of sensory data, attention allows us to focus on specific stimuli, such as our name in a noisy room, while filtering out irrelevant information, like individual blades of grass. This filtering occurs throughout the processing stages, shaping our perception and understanding.\n\nFor information to be processed, it must first be stored in different types of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. Information is initially encoded based on the type of sensory input, such as visually, auditorily, or semantically. Working memory, which holds information for a short period (around 20 seconds), is thought to be maintained by electrical signals looping through neurons. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is believed to be stored in the structure of specific proteins.\n\nNumerous models attempt to explain how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing upon insights from psychology, computer science, and neuroscience. One prominent model is the semantic network model, which proposes that concepts are represented as nodes interconnected based on their relationships. For instance, \"chair\" would be linked to \"table,\" which in turn might be linked to \"wooden,\" creating a network of interconnected concepts.",
            "Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" critiques the dangers of both technological advancement and the capitalist system that perpetuates it. The novel depicts a dystopian society where individuals are conditioned to prioritize community and instant gratification over personal fulfillment. Citizens are mere cogs in a machine, controlled by the World Controller and confined to a single, imposed ideology. \n\nThrough a Marxist lens, Huxley's anxieties about these emerging systems become apparent. Terms like \"homogeny\" and \"reification,\" central to Marxist thought, suggest that the novel serves as a critique of the flaws inherent in the economic structures of Huxley's time.\n\nCapitalism is satirized through the concept of \"false consciousness,\" where the working class is kept oblivious to their true economic position due to their focus on personal gain. This ideological control, evident in the conditioning of the citizens in \"Brave New World,\" strips lower classes like Deltas and Gammas of their independent will.  They are driven by a hyper-focus on consuming and indulging, a result of manipulation by the World Controller. \n\nThe novel exemplifies \"hegemony,\" where a ruling class exerts dominance over subordinate classes. The lower classes are unaware of this manipulation, unknowingly supporting the capitalist system through their consumerism.  While upper classes like Alphas and Betas are aware, they remain passive and complicit.\n\nRelationships in \"Brave New World\" are superficial and devoid of depth.  Individuality and free expression seem suppressed by the pervasive influence of technology and capitalism.  Love and strong emotions are absent, replaced by shallow interactions focused on physical appearance and momentary pleasure. The characters' acceptance of their societal roles further emphasizes the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, mirroring Marx's idea of the proletariat being conditioned to believe in their own superiority as long as they consume and obey.",
            "As a student at University Park for over two years, I've experienced firsthand the challenges of navigating the sprawling campus. During my freshman year, living in East Halls, the furthest dorms, commuting to classes in central locations like Willard Building could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially during State College's frequent bad weather. \n\nThe campus has significantly expanded since then, with the once-vast, unused land between East Halls and the rest of the university now filled with sports fields, new buildings, and apartments. This growth has made getting around even more difficult.\n\nWhile a bicycle is an excellent solution for campus mobility, it requires both student adoption and infrastructure that caters to cyclists. A friend who recently returned to cycling after a break shared that it's now his preferred mode of transportation due to its efficiency and convenience.\n\nPersonally, I live off-campus, a distance similar to some dorms, and owning a bike has been a game-changer. My daily commute to Thomas Building, a 25-minute walk, is reduced to just 5 minutes by bike. However, Pollock Road, the quickest route, can be challenging for cyclists.\n\nWhile walking is a viable option, my busy schedule makes it impractical. Without my bike, walking to classes and other appointments would consume an additional 2.5 hours per week, a time commitment I simply can't afford."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "This paper examines the biological and sociocultural factors contributing to insomnia. The biological model emphasizes the role of genetics and physiological factors in sleep, while the sociocultural model considers environmental influences such as race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The paper reviews research studies related to both models, analyzing their findings, strengths, and weaknesses to better understand insomnia.\n\nSleep disorders are categorized as primary, secondary to mental disorders, or secondary to medical conditions or substance use. Primary sleep disorders include dyssomnias (e.g., insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep disorders) and parasomnias (e.g., nightmare disorder, sleep terror disorder, sleepwalking disorder). Secondary sleep disorders arise from mental health conditions (Axis I or Axis II disorders) or medical issues. This review focuses primarily on insomnia and primary sleep disorders, exploring their connections to biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders centers on genetic predispositions and physiological mechanisms. Research on orexin neurons in the hypothalamus, which regulate sleep and wakefulness, suggests a link between the GABAB receptor and sleep regulation. Studies in mice have shown that activating the GABAB receptor promotes sleep, while inhibiting it reduces anxiety and induces sleep. These findings suggest a potential genetic basis for sleep disorders, where variations in the GABAB receptor could contribute to sleep problems. The sociocultural implications of this research highlight the interplay between genetics and environment, where inherited variations in the GABAB receptor could influence sleep patterns and potentially affect individuals' academic, professional, and daily functioning.",
            "This paper explores three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with a concise definition of the disorder. Next, it delves into the diagnosis of CAPD, outlining common indicators or \"red flags.\" Finally, the paper concludes by offering strategies that teachers in inclusive classroom settings can employ to support students with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to the brain's ability to effectively process auditory information.  While individuals with CAPD can hear normally, their brains struggle to translate and interpret sounds, making it difficult to distinguish words, separate conversations from background noise, or understand subtle changes in speech.\n\nThe origins of CAPD research can be traced back to the mid-1950s, initially termed \"auditory imperception.\"  Since then, researchers have developed tests and models to better understand the neurological basis of CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways, including difficulty localizing sounds, discriminating between similar sounds, recognizing sound patterns, understanding changes in speech tone, blocking out background noise, synthesizing auditory information, and determining the sequence of sounds.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a comprehensive assessment that combines observation of listening behaviors and standardized tests of auditory function.  These assessments are typically conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, or psychologists. While there is no single definitive test for CAPD, common methods include presenting patients with multiple sounds simultaneously and asking them to identify specific targets.",
            "Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\" explores the complexities of disguise and deception. While acknowledging that disguise can be effective for prolonged deceit, the play ultimately suggests that abandoning a fabricated identity is crucial for self-preservation, as clinging to it risks losing one's true self. However, ending a deception can lead to alienation from others, as some may react negatively to being tricked.\n\nThe play particularly examines the challenges of gender role reversal through disguise. A central question arises: why would someone choose to adopt the identity of the opposite gender? In Viola's case, this decision stems from self-protection in an unfamiliar land.  \n\nAlthough her disguise provides safety, it isolates her from female companionship and creates a complex web of mistaken identities and emotions. Olivia, believing Viola to be male (Cesario), falls in love with her, while Viola herself develops suppressed feelings for Orsino. This situation highlights how deception can inadvertently expose hidden desires and complexities within characters.\n\nWhile Olivia's attraction to Cesario might initially seem progressive, it could also be interpreted as a satirical commentary on societal norms and superficial judgments. Her swift shift of affection from Cesario to Sebastian, followed by her acceptance of Viola as a sister, underscores this point.",
            "German colonialism is often remembered for its brutality, particularly the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa. However, this simplistic view overlooks the diversity of German colonial policies and practices across its vast empire.  Education, for instance, varied greatly. When Britain took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a significant number of educated Africans. Similarly, German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies received praise from contemporaries. \n\nIn stark contrast, South West Africa (present-day Namibia) saw a different approach. Unlike East Africa, where the government actively established schools and promoted education for natives, South West Africa's education was largely left to missionary societies with minimal government support. The German government, however, heavily invested in educating Europeans, establishing state schools and providing substantial backing to missionary institutions. These policies had a lasting impact on South West Africa, even after German rule ended. While other German colonies boasted literate and educated African populations, South West Africa saw the majority of its people remain uneducated and illiterate. This disparity can be attributed to a complex interplay of social, political, and economic factors, which this paper aims to explore in detail, focusing particularly on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nExisting research on education in the German colonial empire, primarily in German from the early 20th century, often focuses on describing the features of each colony's educational system. Later English-language works have expanded this discourse with comparative studies and deeper analyses of specific aspects of education, highlighting significant differences across colonies. Notably, Cohen's study comparing education in South West Africa and East Africa offers a valuable framework for understanding the factors behind their contrasting educational landscapes. Cohen argues that the substantial settler population in South West Africa played a key role in shaping the colony's unique educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa, with its  temperate climate (despite its arid deserts), attracted a relatively large European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided there, significantly more than the 5,336 in East Africa, the colony with the second-largest settler population.",
            "The vast and ever-expanding landscape of popular music has seen a proliferation of genres over the past century, making it nearly impossible to list them all comprehensively. Each genre, from rap and rock to country and jazz, has spawned numerous subgenres, creating a complex and interconnected web of musical styles. Among these, heavy metal rock has emerged as one of the most diverse and expressive genres in the past 40 years. Its emotional range, often leaning towards the darker aspects of the human experience, and its remarkable adaptability, which has led to countless subgenres and sub-subgenres, contribute to its incredible diversity.\n\nThe sheer number of heavy metal niches today makes it challenging to define precisely what constitutes heavy metal. It has absorbed influences from various genres, yet its origins remain crucial to understanding its evolution. To truly grasp the multifaceted world of metal music, one must first delve into the origins of the metal movement itself, recognizing its unique characteristics and cultural impact.\n\nMetal, in essence, is a movement defined by its intensity and embrace of the darker aspects of human experience. It often features amplified volume, powerful bass lines, and a theatricality that sets it apart. Technical proficiency is highly valued in metal bands, showcasing their mastery of their instruments. \n\nThe movement has also been significantly influenced by drug culture, particularly the psychedelic boom of the mid-1970s. This era saw artists experimenting with drugs, resulting in music that explored unconventional and often unsettling themes. Metal's embrace of darkness and visceral emotions was a departure from the prevailing trends in popular music, offering a new perspective on the spectrum of human emotions. Later generations of metal musicians drew inspiration from the Romantic era's emphasis on dark and intense themes, further shaping the genre's aesthetic.\n\nThe Beatles' song \"Helter Skelter,\" often cited as a precursor to heavy metal, exemplifies the movement's darker side. Its chaotic and unsettling lyrics, possibly reflecting the impact of drug use, showcase a departure from the band's typical style. This song, a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier musical direction, demonstrated the Beatles' willingness to explore darker musical territory.",
            "Several decades before the Surrealists explored dreamlike imagery in their art, Henri Rousseau, a Post-Impressionist painter, was meticulously crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. His 1910 painting, \"The Dream,\" depicts a woman marveling at the wonders of her dreamland, but it also reflects Rousseau's own aspirations as an artist. Throughout his career, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and praise from the art world, facing a difficult internal conflict in pursuing this goal. \"The Dream\" encapsulates Rousseau's lifelong struggle: to conform to prevailing artistic styles to gain acceptance from the art community he admired, or to remain creatively independent and forge his own path.\n\nUnderstanding \"The Dream\" requires some familiarity with Rousseau's life. Born in 1844 in France, he received no formal art training and worked as a toll collector for the French government until he was forty. The loss of his wife and eight infant children deeply affected him, prompting him to find solace and a new beginning through painting. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized peasants in their art, Rousseau, a self-taught artist, captured the hopes and dreams of the ordinary working class.\n\nRousseau's desire for recognition was understandable given his circumstances. He started painting later in life, lacked formal training, and was working alongside many established and talented artists like Matisse. While both artists were contemporaries, their motivations were different, as noted by art historian Jan Gordon. Matisse feared creating conventional art, while Rousseau sought to produce something so traditional that he would be accepted into the prestigious \"Artiste Français\" society.",
            "Many philosophers have recognized a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, believing truth and beauty are intertwined.  This connection stems from the fact that our understanding of ethics and aesthetics isn't solely based on education or experience, as Keats suggests in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn.\"  Instead, these concepts are more about describing than prescribing. We strive to explain what makes art beautiful or an action moral, rather than establishing rigid rules for creation or judgment.\n\nFurthermore, critiquing art or morality often falls short of capturing their true essence. Describing the technical elements of a masterpiece like the Mona Lisa, for example, doesn't fully explain its artistic merit. We often find ourselves saying \"There's just something about it\" when asked about our favorite art or literature, acknowledging that something transcends mere description.\n\nSimilarly, ethics seems to possess this ineffable quality. Like Flannery O'Connor states, stories convey truths that words alone cannot express. No matter how meticulously we analyze a work of literature, there remains a transcendent element. Wittgenstein echoes this sentiment, suggesting ethics is transcendental and cannot be fully articulated.  \n\nI believe this \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, is the most compelling aspect of both art and morality. This shared transcendental nature forms a bridge between them. \n\nBoth ethics and art impact us profoundly on a noumenal level, a realm beyond rational explanation. This connection is particularly strong in literary art, as McKean points out. Literature's inherent moral quality distinguishes it from other art forms.  Literature's relevance stems from the values it reflects, mirroring the values inherent in life itself.",
            "Germany is renowned today as a powerful and unified nation, boasting a distinct culture that spans from the Bavarian Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This cultural identity is palpable in cities like Cologne on the Rhine River, weaving its way through the heart of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River. Given this unique heritage, it's unsurprising that modern Germany emerged from a confluence of diverse tribes and influences. \n\nThe ancestral homeland of the Germans is known as Germania. The origin of this name is hotly debated among scholars and historians. Tacitus, a Roman historian, suggested it derived from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were known as Germans before crossing the Rhine to clash with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98).  Julius Caesar, in his account of the Gallic Wars, first used the term \"Germanus\" to differentiate between the conquered Gauls and the unconquered Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine, often under deceptive pretenses (Caesar, 50-40 BC). He borrowed the word from the Gauls themselves. Some believe it referred to a neighboring people in the Gaulish language. Caesar himself wrote in the first book of his Gallic Wars: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC).  Other theories suggest the name originates from the spear used in Germanic warfare, known as a \"ger\" (O.E.D, 2010), or from the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" hinting at the Germans' perceived loudness or boisterousness (\"Names of Germany\").\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" explored the origins of the Germans, stating: “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?” (Tacitus, 98).\n\nWhile the Romans did engage in campaigns and trade with Germanic tribes, they largely avoided permanently settling in Germania. As Germanic tribes emerged in the first century AD, they resided on the borders of the Roman Empire, exchanging goods and contributing their skills by serving in the Roman army (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "I stared down, my mind processing the scene before me in a detached, analytical way. Thoughts flitted in and out, too quickly to form coherent ideas. It felt like my consciousness was simply observing, without any real emotional engagement.  \n\nI had once tried to improve my drawing skills by following the instructions in a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" It taught about how the brain interprets lines and suggested a technique of focusing on a single element by mentally framing it. \n\nThis time, however, I felt overwhelmed by the situation. I was struck by the sheer magnitude of the task, like facing the start of a grand artistic project.  \n\nMy hand, trembling slightly, reached for the toilet brush, attempting to channel my creativity into this mundane task.  The water swirled, clean and serene, as I tried to work through the initial shock. But the stubborn object refused to budge, stuck like a stubborn lump.  \n\nWith a sigh, I gripped the mop and stared at the mess, a symbol of someone else's carelessness. The green tie around my neck felt like a tightrope walker’s rope, constricting my spirit.",
            "Teenage drivers are involved in a disproportionately high number of fatal car accidents. This issue stems from a combination of factors, including the underdeveloped nature of the teen brain, lack of experience, and the influence of peers. Studies show that teen drivers, especially those with younger passengers, are more likely to be involved in crashes. \n\nWhile some states have implemented provisional licenses with restrictions on driving hours and passenger limits, these measures are seen as temporary solutions. The core problem is that young drivers, statistically, are not yet equipped to handle the complexities and risks associated with driving. Experts suggest that the urge for thrill-seeking common among teenagers contributes to this danger. \n\nRaising the driving age to at least 18 could significantly reduce accidents.  A potential legislative solution involves maintaining driver's education in schools but prohibiting anyone under 18 from obtaining a license.  Provisional permits and supervised practice hours could still be implemented, with the number of hours aligned with current state requirements.  \n\nNational legislation on this issue would ensure consistent safety standards across the country and effectively protect young lives.",
            "My analysis of fifteen trick films produced by Edison between 1895 and 1901, housed in the Library of Congress, focused on their visual storytelling techniques and evolutionary developments.  These films primarily rely on creative editing to create illusions, adhering to a set of conventions typical of early cinema. \n\nThese conventions include a fixed camera position within a frontal proscenium, resembling a stage setup, with no camera movement to follow action.  This framing style, borrowed from theatre and vaudeville, often restricts movement to side-to-side, as seen in films like \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900).\n\nAs a result, shots tend to be long or medium shots, with close-ups absent, mirroring the theatrical tradition of presenting the entire performance within the stage's boundaries. The one-shot-equals-one-film approach, prevalent in early cinema, limits the films to a minute or less and often focuses on short, vaudeville-style tricks rather than elaborate narratives. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that a single \"shot\" in these films may actually encompass multiple physically filmed sequences edited together to create illusions like apparitions or disappearances.  For example, \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) appears as a single shot but reveals a separate filming sequence for Mary's severed \"head.\"",
            "John Taylor, a fervent early supporter of Republicanism, viewed his agricultural background and brief political career as shaping his commitment to individualism and limited government. His agrarian ideals heavily influenced his political stances on sovereignty, constitutional interpretation, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed the U.S. had a unique opportunity to establish an ideal government free from traditional constraints, emphasizing self-governance and the inherent rights of man. He stressed the interconnectedness of these rights, arguing that the infringement of one diminishes the value of all. These rights, he believed, should be protected from governmental encroachment.  He perceived the \"state of nature\" as favoring the physically strong and cunning, and sought to prevent this power imbalance in a civilized society.\n\nTo realize this ideal, Taylor advocated for a government that acknowledged both the good and evil inherent in humanity. He held a rigid dualistic view of morality, believing that government, being human-driven, inevitably reflects both virtues and vices. He defined good principles as those that safeguard private property, promote agriculture, and limit capitalism, arguing that such a government would function fairly regardless of its administration, which he acknowledged would be susceptible to self-interest. While recognizing self-interest as a fundamental human motive, he deemed it detrimental when it prioritized personal gain over the public good, leading to societal divisions. A strong government was necessary to contain this inherent evil, but it too must be closely monitored to prevent the adoption of harmful principles.\n\nLike many Republican contemporaries, Taylor championed a strict interpretation of the Constitution, advocating for a limited federal government with powers explicitly outlined therein. He feared the expense and potential for despotism associated with a larger federal entity. However, he cautioned against a purely literal interpretation, emphasizing the importance of understanding the framers' intentions. Furthermore, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true foundational document of the United States, as it more clearly articulated the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than a unified entity.",
            "The project observed a sharp decline in commuter log submissions during the third month, a trend that was concerning. Several factors might have contributed to this, including the onset of winter, the end of the fall semester, and the holiday season, all of which likely led to reduced campus presence. Additionally, it's possible that the initial enthusiasm for the project naturally waned over time. To address this, a \"Carpool Challenge Week\" was launched in March, boosting log submissions. This highlights a key challenge: sustaining project momentum amidst natural engagement fluctuations and seasonal breaks common in higher education.\n\nAnother hurdle was overcoming the deeply ingrained cultural preference for driving.  To encourage alternative commuting, various prizes were offered, including gift certificates to local businesses. While these incentives were effective initially, the authors speculate that larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars, might have further incentivized participation and mitigated the decline. They also suggest that escalating the value of prizes throughout the project, potentially by announcing larger rewards later on, could have been more effective.",
            "An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of investment security designed to mirror the performance of a specific index, commodity, or basket of assets, similar to an index fund. ETFs offer the diversification benefits of index funds while providing the flexibility to trade like individual stocks, allowing investors to engage in activities like short selling, margin trading, and purchasing fractional shares.  \n\nOne significant advantage of ETFs is their lower expense ratios compared to traditional mutual funds. However, investors should be aware that ETFs incur trading commissions, similar to stock transactions. Additionally, while ETFs boast a wide range of investment options, it's crucial for investors to critically assess the claimed benefits, such as diversification, to ensure they align with their investment goals. \n\nThis analysis focuses on ETF IHF and compares its performance to the top 10 holdings, which collectively account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. By examining these holdings, we aim to determine whether owning the ETF provides comparable benefits to owning a diversified portfolio of these individual stocks and explore potential alternative stock configurations that might yield a more optimal risk-adjusted return (measured by the Sharpe ratio).\n\nTo streamline the evaluation, we'll concentrate on the top 10 holdings. We'll calculate the contribution of each stock to the portfolio's beta and return, assuming the portfolio replicates the ETF's asset allocation.\n\nPreliminary findings indicate that a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings could potentially deliver a higher return (6.11%) with a lower beta (0.12) compared to the ETF. However, further statistical analysis is needed to confirm if these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTherefore, we'll calculate the standard deviation of each top 10 stock and normalize it to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation against the ETF IHF's standard deviation.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" one of his finest poems. In it, he uses the term \"Thulé,\" which he likely borrowed from both Virgil and the German author Goethe. While Virgil used \"Thulé\" to describe a mythical island beyond the known world, Poe's use of the term echoes the themes and characters in Goethe's poem \"The King of Thulé.\"  This connection is highlighted by literary scholars who see similarities between the mournful king in Goethe's poem and the speaker in Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" both grappling with loss and a sense of desolation.  \n\nPoe's familiarity with Goethe's work is further supported by his admiration for Tennyson, a poet who was heavily influenced by Goethe. Given Poe's respect for Tennyson and the wide availability of Goethe's works during Poe's time, it's plausible that Poe drew inspiration from \"The King of Thulé\" when crafting \"Dream-Land.\" Both poems explore themes of grief, isolation, and the allure of a shadowy, dreamlike realm.",
            "Could a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a California grocery store be awarded punitive damages if the store manager was informed about the spill twice but chose to ignore it for half an hour while eating dinner?  A judge is unlikely to immediately dismiss the customer's claim for punitive damages. To justify such an award, the customer must demonstrate that the manager's actions were intentional disregard for the potential harm, as well as highly reprehensible. The customer can argue that the manager should have known the risk of not cleaning the spill because multiple customers had slipped and fallen in similar incidents in the past. While the argument that the manager's actions were despicable might be less convincing, it is still reasonable considering the history of slip-and-fall incidents at the store.\n\nThe incident occurred on October 13, 2009, when two employees notified the manager, Paul Martin, about the applesauce spill. Martin, however, dismissed their concerns, citing his dinner break. Despite being informed twice, Martin failed to address the spill, and an hour later, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell, sustaining a serious back injury.  \n\nIn California, punitive damages can be awarded in cases where a defendant's actions involved oppression, fraud, or malice. Malice is defined as intentional harm or conduct that, lacking intent, is \"despicable\" and shows a deliberate disregard for others' safety. Courts have ruled that conduct can be considered malicious when a person is aware of the potential dangers of their actions and willingly chooses to ignore them.",
            "Four years ago, I took an Islam course at CBC where we debated whether Islam is inherently hostile. This question feels even more crucial today. Since 9/11, I've witnessed the media shift from a hostile stance towards Islam to excessive tolerance.  It's hard to imagine a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with his Muslim family background, running in 2001.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography intrigues me because it contradicts my previous understanding. I believed Muhammad forcibly converted people through conquest, but the biography portrays him as a misunderstood martyr who humbly led others to his teachings.\n\nInterestingly, there are parallels between Muhammad's ministry and Jesus' miracles, such as the story of multiplying food. This style of writing suggests an attempt to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, potentially diminishing the significance of Jesus' miracles.\n\nThe biography also relies heavily on third-party accounts, which I find questionable. While intended to demonstrate the authenticity of the stories, this reliance on hearsay weakens their credibility.\n\nUltimately, what bothers me most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly, humble, and wise figure while historical evidence suggests otherwise. I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "Christian thought has significantly diverged from Jesus' original teachings since his life.  This trend towards increasing distance from the source is apparent throughout history. While traditionalists resist change, their influence is likely to diminish as the world becomes more progressive. A growing awareness of this historical evolution will lead Christians in the future to yearn for a return to the core teachings of Jesus. Over decades or centuries, this desire will manifest as a movement stripping away layers of doctrine added over time, ultimately returning Christianity to its original form. This movement, driven by a desire to rediscover Jesus' true message, will sweep through the United States and Europe, unifying Christians in belief and practice across denominations and divisions.  \n\nThis historical trend, similar to past reversals such as the Roman Empire's transformation from persecutor to Christian institution, will see a return to uniformity in Christianity.  \n\nUnderstanding this evolution requires viewing Jesus' words metaphorically, rather than literally.  \n\nTracing the roots of Christianity reveals its origins in Judaism, a religion centered on monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures.  Even before Roman control of Jerusalem in 63 BCE, Judaism itself was diverse, with various groups like Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general populace.",
            "Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\" exposes the inherent greed and self-centeredness of humanity, particularly within the context of industrial capitalism. The novel depicts factory owners and managers as ruthless individuals driven solely by profit maximization, disregarding the well-being of their employees and the environment. Sinclair vividly portrays the stark contrast between the opulence of the factory owners and the squalid living and working conditions of the workers.\n\nThe imagery of \"the line of buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\" highlights the destructive industrial pollution and the callous indifference of the owners towards its consequences.  They prioritize financial gain over human life, symbolized by the \"great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories\" and the unchecked waste from the surrounding animal pens.\n\nThe novel also exposes the exploitative labor practices prevalent in Packingtown. The owners exploit their employees through long hours, unsafe working conditions, and arbitrary layoffs without any safety nets or support. The absence of worker protections allows the owners to treat their employees as expendable commodities, valuing profit above human dignity.  Sinclair uses the phrase \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\" to emphasize the dehumanizing nature of the system.\n\nThe workers, trapped in a cycle of poverty and exploitation, are likened to slaves, highlighting the stark parallels between the conditions in Packingtown and the horrors of chattel slavery.  Their lack of agency and the absence of support systems further emphasize the systemic injustice they face.",
            "Authors employ various techniques to evoke specific feelings or perspectives in readers regarding significant themes. F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully utilizes several of these techniques in his novel *The Great Gatsby*. One notable technique is his unconventional pairing of adjectives and nouns to create a particular aura around certain subjects. Fitzgerald also imbues symbolism with meaning, using colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink to achieve this purpose. In *The Great Gatsby*, he builds layers of meaning around white/gray, associating them with uniformity. White represents a more refined and elevated class, while gray denotes an older, faded quality.  \n\nFitzgerald establishes this meaning early on through consistent use of these colors. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are constantly depicted in white, signifying their social standing and perhaps a sense of superficiality. This prevalence of white extends to other characters and settings, emphasizing the pervasive nature of this association. In contrast, Fitzgerald uses gray to describe less significant elements, suggesting a sense of banality or insignificance.  He uses these colors to color everyday objects and people, reinforcing the established meanings. \n\nBy repeatedly associating white/gray with specific themes, Fitzgerald later utilizes them to convey a sense of unimportance or uniformity in relation to certain characters and objects. This technique is particularly evident in his portrayal of Daisy. After a period of limited use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy in a \"white roadster,\" subtly diminishing her characterization and presenting her as more of an object of desire for Gatsby.  Further instances of Daisy's description in white and gray reinforce this impression, highlighting her perceived conformity and lack of depth.",
            "San Diego County's favorable climate makes it ideal for agriculture, with popular crops including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a strong demand for organic produce, leading to long waiting lists for community supported agriculture (CSA) programs. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms offer tours, hiking trails, birdwatching opportunities, and other recreational activities, demonstrating how farming can combine profit with environmental stewardship. \n\nOne potential strategy for landowners is to utilize government programs to support organic farming practices that benefit both profitability and wildlife habitats. Organic farming, while often more labor-intensive and potentially less efficient than conventional methods, promotes biodiversity and reduces chemical use.  Additional practices, such as cover cropping, rotational grazing, invasive species removal, and habitat management, can further enhance wildlife benefits but may also increase labor costs. \n\nThis example focuses on a 160-acre parcel near Potrero, California, encompassing chaparral, grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This area is crucial due to its location within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, which is part of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This plan aims to protect over a hundred species, including endangered ones like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and mountain yellow-legged frog. \n\nThe land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries, followed by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. \n\nBy researching government programs and examining successful organic farms in the region, landowners can explore ways to balance financial viability with ecological conservation efforts.",
            "Culture significantly influences negotiations, shaping interactions and outcomes.  While generalizations about cultures can be tempting, it's crucial to recognize that cultures are complex and diverse.  Instead of relying on stereotypes, negotiators should strive to understand the specific cultural values and norms at play in each situation. This involves appreciating how these cultural elements might impact communication styles, decision-making processes, and overall negotiation strategies.\n\nApproaching unfamiliar cultures with an open mind and a willingness to learn is essential.  Understanding a culture's history, perspectives, and potential biases can help bridge cultural gaps and foster productive discussions.  Respecting traditions and beliefs, particularly when in a weaker bargaining position, can pave the way for successful negotiations.\n\nFurthermore, it's important to remember that culture extends beyond national boundaries. Companies often develop their own distinct cultures, influencing everything from work hours and dress codes to communication styles and philanthropic practices. Recognizing these internal cultural variations within organizations adds another layer of complexity to the negotiating landscape.\n\nValues lie at the heart of a culture, providing insights into its motivations and priorities.  For example, a culture that values saving face might prioritize avoiding public humiliation, while a culture that emphasizes competitiveness might be more inclined to push for a favorable outcome.  \n\nUltimately, successful negotiation requires a combination of cultural awareness, respect for individual differences, and a willingness to adapt one's approach accordingly.",
            "This essay analyzes the arguments of St. Anselm and St. Thomas Aquinas for the existence of God. Both philosophers assume the existence of the God of the Bible, focusing on their distinct approaches to proving His presence. Anselm emphasizes faith and introspection, arguing that God's existence is inherently known within our minds. He believes that the very concept of God necessitates His existence, making empirical evidence unnecessary. In contrast, Aquinas relies solely on reason and observable evidence, presenting five logical arguments – change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony – to demonstrate God's logical necessity.  \n\nWhile both provide compelling arguments, the essay questions whether either fully establishes a comprehensive basis for belief in God. Anselm's reliance on faith may not satisfy those seeking concrete proof, while Aquinas's arguments, while logical, rely on assumptions that may be debated.",
            "Around the 5th or 6th century BCE, a prince who later became known as Buddha was born. He renounced worldly possessions, achieved enlightenment, and his teachings gave rise to Buddhism. The most traditional branch of Buddhism, Theravada Buddhism, is approximately 2,500 years old. Over time, it has evolved significantly from its original form. This evolution is evident in various aspects, such as the annual water-cutting ceremony in Sri Lanka, a Theravada Buddhist nation. This ceremony, involving both monks and lay people, holds religious significance despite Buddha not mentioning any such festivity during his lifetime. These changes encompass both external practices and core theological principles. The Theravada Buddhist community, both monastic and lay, has adapted its doctrines over time due to both internal and external influences, both positive and negative.\n\nThis discussion will frequently use specific terms: \"internal\" and \"external\" forces. An \"internal force\" originates from members of the Buddhist community, regardless of their monastic status. An \"external force\" comes from non-Buddhist sources.  A \"hostile force\" aims to damage or harm the Buddhist community, stemming from a negative perception of Buddhism. A \"benign force,\" on the other hand, does not intend to harm or help the community, but its actions may have unintended consequences. These terms will be recurring throughout the analysis.\n\nUnderstanding the core doctrines of Theravada Buddhism is crucial. Buddhists seek refuge in the \"triple gem\": the Buddha, the Dhamma (teachings), and the Sangha (community). The Dhamma encompasses the Tripitaka—the three baskets of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains the discourses of Buddha, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. Key metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these concepts is essential to ending Sansara (the cycle of death and rebirth) and achieving enlightenment. Along with Sansara, desires (lobha), hatred (dosa), and delusion (moha) cease. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for conduct. Laypeople adhere to five precepts (non-killing, non-lying, non-stealing, non-sexual misconduct, and abstaining from intoxicants), while monks follow a more extensive set of monastic rules.  The foundational principle in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, Dukkha—life is inherently suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico experienced a long-standing rivalry from 1836 to 1893, marked by numerous conflicts and tensions. The rivalry reached its peak during the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), where the U.S. emerged victorious, gaining Texas and the American Southwest.  This rivalry, rooted in differences in religion, culture, and competing economic interests, mirrored similar tensions between neighboring nations. As David M. Pletcher observed, the U.S. faced enduring diplomatic challenges primarily with Mexico and Cuba, both geographically close and historically rivals. \n\nReligious differences, particularly anti-Catholic sentiment among Americans, further fueled the animosity, echoing the ideological struggles of the Cold War. This distrust stemmed from the historical rivalry between England and Spain, their former colonial rulers.\n\nDuring this 57-year period, 17 disputes arose, primarily concerning territorial issues and border skirmishes. Banditry and outlaws operating across the border were a constant problem until both nations increased their military presence along the frontier.\n\nBy the late 19th century, Mexico's economic dependence on the U.S. and a shift in American interests from territorial expansion to economic influence in Mexico gradually lessened the rivalry.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was unexpectedly disabled by an illness I had never encountered before.  As a nurse, I had chosen my profession for the stability and security I lacked as a child, believing that healthcare was a reliable source of employment. While my true passions lay in science and journalism, I ultimately settled for nursing. However, at the age of 46 and single, I found myself without savings and unable to work due to my disability. After 15 years on Social Security Disability, I have depleted my resources and face daily struggles that threaten my security, safety, and self-esteem. Despite the uncertainty in my life, one certainty remains: I wouldn't have survived these years without the support of my family and close friends, proving that even the strongest individuals need help during times of crisis.\n\nLife inevitably throws curveballs, both big and small.  Despite careful planning, some challenges are too overwhelming to handle alone.  \n\nWhile I agree that we should be wary of relying solely on government assistance, I believe Americans need to rediscover the importance of community and mutual support.  Rather than isolating ourselves in self-sufficiency, we should learn to trust and help one another.  \n\nThe American ideal of \"rugged individualism\" often overshadows the truth: our ancestors persevered not solely through individual strength, but through compassion, respect, and shared resources.  The pioneers who journeyed westward relied on each other to survive.\n\nTherefore, be prepared for emergencies.  Stock up on supplies like a disaster kit, first aid, water purification tablets, and non-perishable food.  If possible, consider gardening or having a wood stove.  But equally important is building strong connections with your neighbors.",
            "The evolution of organisms and the factors that shape their development are complex questions that scientists continue to explore. While fully understanding these processes remains a challenge, mathematical modeling has emerged as a valuable tool for investigating evolutionary and developmental change.  \n\nThis study focuses on the application of mathematical modeling to the evolution of shell morphology in the mollusk genus *Prunum*. By combining mathematical models with experimental observations and traditional descriptive studies, researchers aim to decipher the mechanisms driving changes in shell shape and size over evolutionary time. \n\nTo achieve this, the researchers used X-ray images of *Prunum* species to quantify shell features and create digital models. These models were then used to simulate hypothetical shell morphologies, helping to define the potential range of evolutionary possibilities. The findings from these modeling exercises are being integrated with experimental and descriptive data to gain a more comprehensive understanding of macroevolutionary trends in this group of mollusks.\n\n\nThe study highlights the unique nature of shells, describing them as three-dimensional structures that develop through a series of coiled whorls spiraling around a central axis known as the columella. The size and shape of these whorls, along with the sutures separating them, contribute to the overall form of the shell. The researchers also discuss different ways of viewing and analyzing shells, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. \n\nUltimately, the researchers view shell development as a series of apertures moving through space and time as the organism grows. By tracing the path of these apertures mathematically, they hope to uncover the underlying principles governing shell morphogenesis.",
            "Despite progress in areas like water and sanitation, Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have remained stagnant for the past decade.  While the country is striving to meet the Millennium Development Goals, significant improvements in child and maternal health are lacking to achieve the 2015 targets.  This stagnation highlights the need to strengthen the overall health system rather than relying solely on targeted programs.\n\nAlthough the percentage of births attended by skilled health workers has increased to 72%, this figure includes traditional practitioners who may not be equipped to handle complications, contributing to high maternal mortality rates due to hemorrhage.  Furthermore, the decline in the percentage of children under five treated for diarrhea by healthcare professionals is concerning.  Data on postnatal care is limited but suggests a need for improvement across the country.\n\nCesarean section rates remain low at 4%, with a stark disparity between urban (7%) and rural (2%) areas, underscoring inequalities in healthcare access.  The gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles (27%) further emphasizes the challenges faced by low-income communities in accessing healthcare, likely due to financial constraints.\n\nMoving forward, Indonesia faces a critical question: should it focus on specific programs or strengthen the entire health system? While targeted programs offer quick results and manageable objectives, they can divert resources from other areas and lead to duplication of services.  Investing heavily in one sector can also result in a brain drain, as skilled personnel gravitate towards areas with more funding, as seen with the impact of HIV/AIDS funding on family planning programs.",
            "Victorian novels are typically known for their meticulous attention to detail and focus on the aristocracy. However, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" while considered Victorian novels, deviate from this trend. Both incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, which is uncommon in novels of that era. This stylistic choice strengthens the characters by providing deeper insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\nAn example of this can be seen in a passage from \"Oliver Twist\": \"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\"  \n\nThe novels often utilize mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the content and purpose vary in each case. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these strange occurrences often reveal insights into Oliver's inner turmoil, his suffering, and his understanding of the true nature of events around him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he relives the experience vividly, as if in a dream, while struggling to find help. The passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the unfolding events and the dire state of his health, evident in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing his senses as he doesn't notice the \"unseen hand\" carrying him away. He experiences his despair anew, detached from the initial shock of pain, as the pain becomes a constant, linked to fear rather than surprise.  Oliver's helplessness raises the question of whose will orchestrated his misfortune, as it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the idea that Oliver has little control over his life, unable to even attempt to influence the outcome of an event, even when his life is in danger. The passage also suggests a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if Fagin has broken him, forcing him to accept this despair and hindering his ability to react. Otherwise, it is reasonable to assume Oliver would have made some effort, at least to save himself.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.\"",
            "A few years ago, while working as a tutor in an after-school program for elementary students, I noticed a peculiar reading challenge with a third or fourth-grade boy named Adrian. Despite speaking perfect English, he struggled with pronunciation, understanding some letters perfectly while others were completely foreign to him. His Latino heritage led me to believe his first language was Spanish.  \n\nThe situation became clearer when Adrian's mother, who only spoke Spanish, arrived during a field trip.  With my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate, and it dawned on me that Adrian wasn't necessarily reading poorly, but rather lacked a strong grasp of the English alphabet. \n\nThis experience highlighted the complexities of language barriers in schools, particularly in California.  Even for students who speak English fluently, reading can pose significant obstacles. While tutoring Adrian in English phonics and alphabet recognition proved helpful in his case, the challenges faced by children with limited English proficiency are much more multifaceted.\n\nEffective solutions require a multi-pronged approach. Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes all have their merits, but no single solution is sufficient. Combining these approaches is crucial.\n\nDual language programs offer significant benefits for all children, not just those whose first language is Spanish. Research shows that students in these programs often outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns about resource allocation and lack of benefit for the majority, widespread implementation of dual language programs would benefit all students.\n\nWhile requiring all teachers to be bilingual might be unrealistic, incorporating bilingual aids or tutors could effectively support language learning.",
            "From a young age, many of us are taught about a higher power, something beyond our understanding. Some seek answers in organized religion, while others explore spirituality within themselves.  We often adopt the beliefs of our upbringing, but some reject them entirely, focusing solely on their own experiences. Our perspectives on spirituality evolve over time, leading us on a personal journey to find meaning and guidance in life.  We yearn for light amidst darkness, seeking a path to enlightenment.\n\nThe story then shifts to a poignant moment shared between a father and child. The father, facing his own mortality, reflects on life while listening to the rain. The son, sensing his father's fragility, feels a deep sense of loss and struggles to express his emotions. They sit together in silence, united by their shared experience.\n\nTragically, the father passes away shortly after, leaving his son grappling with grief and questioning his faith. He feels abandoned by a God who seemingly ignores his pleas. The son chooses to avoid witnessing his father's death, honoring his belief that his father wouldn't want him to be a passive observer. He retreats into solitude, waiting for news of his father's passing.  The indifference of those around him adds to his feelings of isolation and pain.",
            "The Gothic novel is a paradoxical blend of old and new, as literary scholar Ian Watt aptly describes it. It has been both criticized and celebrated, sometimes dismissed as superficial and other times lauded for its evocative \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" considered the first Gothic novel, skillfully merges elements of ancient and modern romances to establish a new literary style. Walpole combines traditional theatrical elements with the more intimate, psychologically driven style of modern novels, creating what he calls \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). \n\nThe Gothic genre draws heavily on medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, even though the term \"Gothic\" itself was often used disparagingly at the time, associated with archaism and lack of sophistication compared to the perceived advancements of the modern era. The unique fusion of the theatrical \"Gothic\" with the novel's ability to delve into characters' inner lives contributes to the genre's enduring appeal, allowing it to remain both timeless and strangely novel to readers across generations.\n\nA key concept in Gothic novels is chivalry, reflecting the medieval ideal of knightly training.  Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, often romanticize this concept because it represents the epitome of bravery, honor, and competence—qualities they believed were lacking in contemporary society. By resurrecting chivalric ideals, they implicitly critique the present and yearn for a return to a perceived golden age. Walpole, writing during a time of political turmoil and personal accusations, may have felt a particular sense of disillusionment with modern society, leading him to romanticize the supposed morality and inherent goodness of the past. This sentiment is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits: he is a prince, a tragic figure, and is believed to have been killed by enemies. This idealized portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" (66) foreshadows the Gothic trope of exaggeration and excess.",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the intricate processes involved in moving goods from a customer's order through every stage, including raw materials, supply, production, and distribution, until the product reaches the customer.  Coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, this term highlights the strategic planning, execution, and monitoring of these processes to meet customer needs efficiently and promptly.\n\nSix key elements form the backbone of a successful supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Businesses leverage these elements to deliver exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction, the initial stage, lays the groundwork for the entire supply chain. It involves defining the \"when,\" \"why,\" \"where,\" and \"how\" of production.  Understanding customer demand is paramount, and market analysis serves as a vital indicator. By scrutinizing market trends, managers can determine customer preferences and make informed decisions about product types and quantities.  \n\nOnce production scope is determined, managers identify the optimal production location, considering factors like volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. Determining production schedules and equipment maintenance fall under this stage.  Careful planning at each stage is crucial, as any oversight can lead to significant time and financial losses.  \n\nThe second key element is supply, encompassing strategic decisions regarding core facility capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Companies often have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with distinct equipment, workforce, and specializations. Managers must strategically allocate tasks among these divisions or consider outsourcing to external companies. Outsourcing aims to enhance velocity, achieving quality, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.",
            "Ellen Page, known for her role in the film \"Juno,\" holds a sign on a street corner that reads, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" The sign highlights the ongoing oppression in Myanmar (formerly Burma), a Southeast Asian nation ruled by a military junta that seized power in 1962. \n\nIn 2007, a series of protests, known as the \"Saffron Revolution,\" erupted led by Buddhist monks who were demanding democratic reforms. Initially peaceful, the protests were met with brutal force by the military. Journalists were imprisoned, and some, like Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai, were killed. Despite official claims of limited casualties, defectors from the military suggest the death toll was significantly higher.\n\nThis pattern of government suppression of dissent is not unique to Myanmar. Throughout history, regimes have sought to maintain absolute control, from ancient Roman emperors claiming divine authority to the current U.S. president's alleged meetings with the leader of a fictional group.\n\nExamples of such atrocities include the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in China, where the government violently suppressed student-led protests, and the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s, where Hutu extremists, with government support, systematically killed Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The Holocaust, perpetrated by Nazi Germany, stands as a horrific example of state-sanctioned genocide against Jews.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring legacy in jazz stems from his long career and his exceptional ability to shape his orchestra. Although his piano playing is often understated in his compositions, Ellington was a masterful composer who created intricate and vibrant pieces that showcased the individual talents of his band members. He meticulously crafted musical frameworks that allowed for improvisation while also composing tightly arranged sections and phrases that highlighted the unique styles of each musician. This attention to detail contributed to the distinct and original tonal qualities of his orchestra, making each piece unique and coherent. Ellington's deep understanding of his musicians' individual sounds and how they blended together as an ensemble enabled him to compose some of the most innovative and brilliant works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative use of voice as a \"jazz instrument\" throughout his career, citing \"Creole Love Call\" as an early example.  This piece demonstrates Ellington's ability to use voice for added texture and color without relying on lyrics. It also showcases his talent for complementing the styles of his soloists, a characteristic that permeates his entire body of work.  This slow, bluesy twelve-bar piece, composed of six choruses, features a call-and-response dynamic between voice and reeds, with the voice transitioning from smooth and melodic to rougher towards the end.  A muted trumpet solo follows, elaborating on the melody and emphasizing bluesy notes. A soaring clarinet solo backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase comes next, followed by the full band echoing the first chorus with a call-and-response between brass and reeds. The climactic fifth chorus sees the reeds leading the call-and-response at a higher register, supported by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. The final chorus returns to the structure of the first, with a call-and-response between voice and reeds, this time featuring the voice using a \"growl\" technique, showcasing it as an instrument. The piece concludes with a brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant ending from the trombone.\n\nEllington's innovative use of voice in \"Creole Love Call\" is just one example of the stylistic approach that defines his music.  In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington combines his mastery of orchestration with his keen ear for tonal color. A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing blends the vocal qualities of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice, creating a rich and complementary sound. In \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" Ellington further emphasizes these ideas by featuring Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a mainstay in his orchestra, introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "She had always felt a deep yearning for something she couldn't quite define. This desire began during her teenage years and persisted even at 17. While she yearned for a connection with someone, she found herself uninterested in any boys who showed romantic interest. This lack of romantic inclination puzzled her, leading to much introspection and speculation. Despite her efforts, she couldn't pinpoint the reason for this unusual situation. She continued to navigate life, constantly questioning her desires.\n\nHer family life was usually peaceful. Her parents were calm and rarely argued, and disagreements with their daughter were uncommon. The only area of friction stemmed from her assertive and independent nature, which contrasted with their more subdued personalities.  Despite this, her outgoing and friendly disposition made her well-liked.\n\nHowever, this day was anything but ordinary. As she searched for inspiration, a scream from the kitchen startled her. Racing to her mother's aid, she found her lying on the floor in pain. Her mother, struggling to speak, managed to tell her daughter she needed to go to the hospital.  Relieved that she had taken self-defense classes, the daughter quickly carried her mother to the car and drove her to the hospital.\n\nThe sterile atmosphere of the hospital was overshadowed by her daughter's anxiety for her mother's well-being. She rushed her mother inside, calling for medical assistance. Doctors and nurses quickly gathered around, taking her mother to be examined. \n\nIt turned out her mother had fallen off a step stool while reaching for a vase on a high shelf.",
            "This study examined the connection between adhering to a modified Mediterranean diet (aMed diet) and the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke-related deaths. The aMed diet emphasizes plant-based foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, and fish, while limiting animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted. \n\nPrevious research suggested a link between a traditional Mediterranean diet and reduced risk of heart disease and mortality. This study, focusing on 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 from the Nurses' Health Study, tracked their dietary habits over 20 years using food frequency questionnaires. \n\nThe researchers calculated a cumulative aMed diet score for each participant, taking into account factors like age, smoking, body mass index, hormone use, physical activity, and other lifestyle factors. They found that women with higher aMed scores had a significantly lower risk of developing CHD and stroke compared to those with lower scores. During the study, 2391 cases of CHD, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular deaths occurred. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a 29% reduced risk of CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile.",
            "The U.S. economy suffered a severe financial crisis in 2007, marked by rising unemployment, a collapsing housing market, and the downfall of major corporations. This recession's ongoing impact compels us to examine its causes and potential solutions.  The crisis stemmed from irresponsible and shortsighted political decisions that encouraged banks and firms to issue subprime loans into an already fragile financial system.  Government entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac further exacerbated the situation by packaging these risky mortgages into complex investments known as CDOs and CDSs.  When borrowers defaulted, banks faced capital shortages and transferred their losses onto these repackaged mortgages, ultimately destabilizing the entire economy.\n\nThe roots of this crisis can be traced back to 1999 during the Clinton administration.  President Clinton, seeking re-election, relaxed lending regulations to boost his popularity, inadvertently setting the stage for the subprime crisis years later.  As reported by the New York Times, Fannie Mae, under pressure from the government and shareholders, aggressively expanded its mortgage lending, a move that was foreseen by journalist Steven Holmes to potentially lead to a government bailout similar to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.  \n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the complex structure of mortgages.  Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs intertwined various sectors of the economy with the housing market, leading to excessive leverage and vulnerability to price fluctuations.  When the housing bubble burst, financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities suffered significant losses.  The crisis had a devastating impact on major investment banks, forcing some, like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, into bankruptcy or government intervention, while others, like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, were forced to restructure as commercial banks under strict regulation.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, also came under government control in 2008.",
            "Exposition, the part of a story where you explain background information, can be tricky. While it's important to give readers context, too much exposition can be boring and make them lose interest. \n\nThink of it like this: instead of simply stating facts about a character, show their personality and history through their actions, words, and interactions with others.  \n\nFor example, instead of saying a character was deeply in love with their husband, describe their loving gestures, conversations, and how their husband's presence made them feel. This creates a stronger emotional connection for the reader and makes the character's grief more impactful when their husband dies.\n\nWhen writing, resist the urge to rush through important details about your characters. Take the time to flesh them out and make them feel real to your readers.",
            "I watched two Columbus, Ohio newscasts on August 13, 2011. The first, NBC 4, featured a brief report on Shad Hostettler, a man who had stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. Details were limited, stating only that she had been stabbed multiple times and he had been arrested. \n\nThe second story involved the shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in Sharon Woods. He was critically injured, and the SWAT team was investigating. I felt this story was short, possibly due to Buyers' race. I've noticed a pattern of media downplaying crimes involving minorities compared to those involving white victims.\n\nThe news also covered a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, likely caused by a .22 caliber rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest. \n\nA short weather update followed, mentioning predicted rain and thunderstorms for the weekend. \n\nA robbery at a UDF on Clime Road was reported, with emphasis given to the robber's race and appearance (a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie). This level of detail regarding his race felt unusual.\n\nFinally, the news covered Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin sentenced to 25 years for marijuana distribution to Ohio.  The unusual phrasing of \"300 months\" instead of years was noted, as well as the mention of his Hispanic ethnicity, which seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "The bond between brothers is unique and unbreakable, encompassing a complex mix of emotions like love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers share a deep understanding that transcends ordinary relationships, seeing a reflection of themselves in each other. This bond is most vividly revealed in times of crisis, revealing its true nature, whether positive or negative.  Comprehending the emotions stemming from this fraternal connection involves accepting the consequences that come with them. Looking into a brother's eyes allows one to see their true self, not how others perceive them, but their genuine essence. Their actions and the repercussions of those actions ultimately define their character.  \n\n\"The Scarlet Ibis\" explores this theme through the relationship between two brothers, highlighting the intense emotions that accompany it. Set against a lush and vivid backdrop, the brothers embark on a doomed journey. The story culminates in a clash between bitter disappointment and intense pride, leaving only one brother alive. The theme is conveyed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with his brother, as well as the narrator's perspective, which reveals the protagonist's complex feelings and his perception of the world around him, both of which heavily influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are primarily driven by pride. From their first outings together to their final, tragic expedition, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He yearned for a brother who could keep up with his aspirations, participating in activities like running, jumping, and climbing. He envisioned a brother who could be his companion in adventures and games.  However, Doodle's physical limitations, due to a weak heart, shattered these dreams. This realization deeply disappointed the protagonist, who even contemplated harming Doodle out of frustration. This dark thought, while fleeting, reveals the depth of his anger and resentment. Yet, Doodle's innocent smile melts the protagonist's anger, showcasing a lingering love beneath the surface.",
            "The human brain is a complex system responsible for processing information in creative ways. As technology has evolved, so too have the metaphors used to describe the brain, progressing from simple comparisons like a wax tablet or papyrus to more sophisticated analogies like a computer. However, it's important to remember that these metaphors have limitations and can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory input, where our senses transform physical stimuli into electrochemical signals. These signals are then processed by the brain through two primary mechanisms: bottom-up and top-down processing. Bottom-up processing analyzes basic elements like color and shape to build a complete understanding, while top-down processing utilizes prior knowledge and expectations to speed up recognition. For example, when viewing a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing identifies the individual components, while top-down processing helps us quickly recognize it as a box based on our existing knowledge.\n\nAttention plays a crucial role in filtering and prioritizing information. While our brain processes a vast amount of sensory data, attention allows us to focus on specific stimuli, such as our name in a noisy room, while filtering out irrelevant information, like individual blades of grass. This filtering occurs throughout the processing stages, shaping our perception and understanding.\n\nFor information to be processed, it must first be stored in different types of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. Information is initially encoded based on the type of sensory input, such as visually, auditorily, or semantically. Working memory, which holds information for a short period (around 20 seconds), is thought to be maintained by electrical signals looping through neurons. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is believed to be stored in the structure of specific proteins.\n\nNumerous models attempt to explain how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing upon insights from psychology, computer science, and neuroscience. One prominent model is the semantic network model, which proposes that concepts are represented as nodes interconnected based on their relationships. For instance, \"chair\" would be linked to \"table,\" which in turn might be linked to \"wooden,\" creating a network of interconnected concepts.",
            "Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" critiques the dangers of both technological advancement and the capitalist system that perpetuates it. The novel depicts a dystopian society where individuals are conditioned to prioritize community and instant gratification over personal fulfillment. Citizens are mere cogs in a machine, controlled by the World Controller and confined to a single, imposed ideology. \n\nThrough a Marxist lens, Huxley's anxieties about these emerging systems become apparent. Terms like \"homogeny\" and \"reification,\" central to Marxist thought, suggest that the novel serves as a critique of the flaws inherent in the economic structures of Huxley's time.\n\nCapitalism is satirized through the concept of \"false consciousness,\" where the working class is kept oblivious to their true economic position due to their focus on personal gain. This ideological control, evident in the conditioning of the citizens in \"Brave New World,\" strips lower classes like Deltas and Gammas of their independent will.  They are driven by a hyper-focus on consuming and indulging, a result of manipulation by the World Controller. \n\nThe novel exemplifies \"hegemony,\" where a ruling class exerts dominance over subordinate classes. The lower classes are unaware of this manipulation, unknowingly supporting the capitalist system through their consumerism.  While upper classes like Alphas and Betas are aware, they remain passive and complicit.\n\nRelationships in \"Brave New World\" are superficial and devoid of depth.  Individuality and free expression seem suppressed by the pervasive influence of technology and capitalism.  Love and strong emotions are absent, replaced by shallow interactions focused on physical appearance and momentary pleasure. The characters' acceptance of their societal roles further emphasizes the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, mirroring Marx's idea of the proletariat being conditioned to believe in their own superiority as long as they consume and obey.",
            "As a student at University Park for over two years, I've experienced firsthand the challenges of navigating the sprawling campus. During my freshman year, living in East Halls, the furthest dorms, commuting to classes in central locations like Willard Building could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially during State College's frequent bad weather. \n\nThe campus has significantly expanded since then, with the once-vast, unused land between East Halls and the rest of the university now filled with sports fields, new buildings, and apartments. This growth has made getting around even more difficult.\n\nWhile a bicycle is an excellent solution for campus mobility, it requires both student adoption and infrastructure that caters to cyclists. A friend who recently returned to cycling after a break shared that it's now his preferred mode of transportation due to its efficiency and convenience.\n\nPersonally, I live off-campus, a distance similar to some dorms, and owning a bike has been a game-changer. My daily commute to Thomas Building, a 25-minute walk, is reduced to just 5 minutes by bike. However, Pollock Road, the quickest route, can be challenging for cyclists.\n\nWhile walking is a viable option, my busy schedule makes it impractical. Without my bike, walking to classes and other appointments would consume an additional 2.5 hours per week, a time commitment I simply can't afford."
