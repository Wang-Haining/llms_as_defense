            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Cultural understanding is essential in negotiations, though culture itself defies simple definition. Rather than being a uniform entity, culture is complex and multifaceted. It's misleading to make sweeping generalizations about national characteristics, such as claiming all people from a particular country share identical traits. Instead, negotiators should focus on understanding how specific cultural aspects influence the negotiation process and interpret these through the lens of their own cultural background.\n\nSuccessfully navigating cultural differences requires comprehensive understanding, from historical context to inherent biases. Rather than criticizing or attempting to modify cultural norms, negotiators should accept and work within them, particularly when in a disadvantaged position. When negotiating in unfamiliar cultural territory, showing respect for local customs and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers.\n\nCultural differences exist not only between nations but also within organizations. Corporate cultures can vary significantly, even within the same country, manifesting in different work schedules, dress codes, communication styles, and philanthropic approaches. Even within American companies, cultural variations can be observed across different regions and settings, demonstrating the complexity of cultural diversity within a single society. While some cultures may appear more homogeneous, deeper examination often reveals subtle variations.\n\nUnderstanding cultural values is crucial as they explain behavioral motivations. For instance, in cultures prioritizing face-saving and group harmony, negotiators won't risk public embarrassment to achieve success. Similarly, those from cultures valuing aggressive negotiation may resist quick settlements. While these cultural patterns are important to consider, successful negotiators also recognize the importance of understanding their counterparts on an individual level.",
            "The passage \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" appears in Psalm 14 and serves as the foundation for both St. Anselm's and Thomas Aquinas's arguments for God's existence. To effectively compare their perspectives, we must accept their shared premise of the Biblical God's existence, rather than considering alternative divine concepts. While both philosophers present compelling arguments, neither provides a complete foundation for divine belief.\n\nSt. Anselm's approach centers on finding divine proof through internal reflection and faith. His argument suggests that since we can comprehend God in our understanding, we cannot truly conceive of His non-existence. Though sometimes complex in its expression, his core message is that divine proof resides within human consciousness, requiring no external validation. This internal validation approach exemplifies the Christian concept of faith.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas proposes that God's existence can be demonstrated purely through rational thinking and observable evidence, without requiring faith. This approach would particularly benefit Christian evangelism, as it could convince potential converts through pure logic rather than requiring acceptance of unprovable concepts. Aquinas presents five logical arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. His methodology resembles completing a puzzle - even with one piece missing, you can deduce its characteristics and existence through logical reasoning based on the surrounding pieces.",
            "Authors employ various literary devices to evoke specific emotions or perspectives in their readers, with some methods proving more successful than others. In The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald demonstrates masterful use of these techniques. He creates unique effects by combining unexpected adjectives with nouns and by developing symbolic meanings through color imagery. Particularly notable is his use of colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. Throughout the novel, Fitzgerald carefully constructs meaning around these colors, especially white/gray and red/pink, using them to trigger specific emotional responses when readers encounter important elements of the story.\n\nThe white/gray color scheme in Fitzgerald's work represents conformity and standardization, with white suggesting refinement and higher social status, while gray indicates aging and deterioration. This symbolism is established early in the novel through repeated references. Characters frequently appear in white attire - Daisy and Jordan are consistently described \"in white,\" Nick dons \"white flannels\" for Gatsby's gathering, Tom appears in a \"white shirt\" during his meeting with Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white.\" The only notable exception occurs during Nick's observations of Gatsby's party, where \"primary colors\" dominate the scene. Fitzgerald reinforces these color associations by applying them to mundane elements: New York's streets become \"white chasms,\" party guests' names fade to \"gray names,\" and Catherine's living space is depicted as part of a uniform \"white cake of apartment-houses.\"\n\nHaving established these color associations, Fitzgerald strategically employs them to convey deeper meaning, particularly in characterizing Daisy. After a period without significant color references, Fitzgerald deliberately presents Daisy \"dressed in white\" in a \"white roadster,\" encouraging readers to view her as a symbol of conformity rather than a fully developed character - merely an object of Gatsby's desire. This characterization is further reinforced through additional white and gray imagery, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and her \"white\" dress before the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County's favorable Mediterranean climate makes it an agricultural powerhouse, yielding diverse crops including vegetables, fruits, honey, and herbs. The region shows strong demand for organic, community-supported agriculture, with local farms often maintaining waitlists. Many organic operations enhance their revenue by offering educational tours and recreational activities, allowing landowners to benefit from government initiatives while supporting wildlife habitat and creating additional income streams.\n\nWhile organic farming promotes greater biodiversity through chemical-free practices, it comes with unique challenges. These include higher labor costs, more intensive management requirements, and potentially lower yields compared to conventional farming. Additional wildlife-friendly practices, such as cover cropping and strategic grazing, further increase operational costs, making financial assistance and expert guidance valuable for balancing profitability with habitat preservation.\n\nThe case study focuses on a 160-acre property near Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. The land, comprising chaparral, Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This area provides habitat for numerous endangered and threatened species, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat and California gnatcatcher.\n\nThe property's history reflects the region's cultural heritage, from its indigenous inhabitants to its late 1800s settlers who used the land for cattle ranching and wood harvesting. Originally established through a homestead patent, the land likely supported grazing and timber production for many years. This case study examined real estate options and government programs available to small farmers interested in sustainable agriculture and wildlife conservation, using a local organic farm as a model.",
            "The relationship between brothers is defined by an eternal, unshakeable connection that encompasses various emotions including affection, honor, envy, and brutality. Siblings share a unique understanding that allows them to see themselves reflected in each other, particularly during challenging times when their true nature emerges. These emotional revelations often come at a significant price, as brothers must face the implications of their feelings and actions. When siblings truly see themselves in each other, they glimpse their authentic selves rather than their public persona.\n\nThis dynamic is powerfully illustrated in \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" where two brothers' relationship unfolds against a richly detailed backdrop. Their journey, though ultimately futile, culminates in a dramatic scene where pride and disappointment collide, resulting in tragedy. The story's themes are conveyed through the characterization of Doodle and his interactions with his brother, while the narrator's perspective reveals the complex emotional landscape that drives their actions.\n\nThe protagonist's behavior is fundamentally driven by pride. He harbors resentment toward his brother Doodle from their earliest interactions, having dreamed of a sibling who could match him in physical activities like swimming, running, and climbing. Doodle's severe heart condition makes these aspirations impossible, crushing the protagonist's expectations. The narrator's initial hostility toward Doodle is so severe that he even contemplates murder, though this dark impulse is dispelled by Doodle's innocent smile. This transformation reveals an underlying love beneath the surface, suggesting that his negative feelings weren't deeply rooted but rather stemmed from disappointed expectations.",
            "The human brain functions as a sophisticated information processor with remarkable complexity and inventiveness. Our understanding of it has evolved alongside technology, with historical comparisons ranging from wax tablets to modern computers, though it's important to note these analogies have their limitations.\n\nThe brain's information processing begins when sensory organs convert physical stimuli into electrochemical signals. These signals undergo dual processing: bottom-up processing assembles basic sensory data (like colors and edges) into recognizable objects, while top-down processing uses existing knowledge to enhance and speed up recognition. For instance, when viewing a black box against white space, both processes work together to help you correctly interpret what you're seeing.\n\nThe brain employs an attention filtering system to prioritize information processing. This system determines which signals deserve conscious awareness - for example, filtering out individual grass blades while walking but highlighting personally relevant information like hearing your name in a crowded space.\n\nInformation storage in the brain occurs through multiple memory systems: sensory, working, and long-term memory. Information undergoes encoding specific to its sensory type - verbal information, for example, can be encoded based on appearance, sound, or meaning. Working memory temporarily stores information through neural electrical circuits lasting about 20 seconds, while long-term memory appears to be preserved through protein structures.\n\nKnowledge organization in the brain has been explained through various models, drawing from human memory studies, computer science, and neurophysiology. One prominent model, the semantic network, suggests that information is organized as interconnected concept nodes. For example, mental concepts like \"chair\" connect to related concepts like \"table\" and \"wooden\" in an elaborate network of associations.",
            "The 2007 financial crisis in the United States caused widespread economic devastation, marked by rising unemployment, a housing market collapse, and the downfall of major corporations. This economic downturn's effects continue to resonate, prompting critical questions about its origins and prevention. The crisis emerged from misguided political decisions that encouraged banks to issue risky subprime loans within an inadequate financial system. The situation worsened when government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were compelled to convert these mortgages into complex financial instruments (CDOs and CDS'). When borrowers began defaulting, banks' insufficient capital reserves triggered a chain reaction that contaminated the broader economy.\n\nThe crisis's origins can be traced to 1999 during President Clinton's administration. Seeking re-election, Clinton's team loosened lending regulations, inadvertently setting the stage for the subsequent subprime crisis. A New York Times journalist, Steven Holmes, presciently warned about Fannie Mae's increased pressure to expand lending to lower-income borrowers while maintaining profit growth. Holmes accurately predicted that such practices could require government intervention during an economic downturn.\n\nThe crisis was amplified by innovative but risky mortgage products. The widespread use of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs created deep interconnections between the housing market and other economic sectors. This led to excessive leverage among U.S. households and financial markets, making them highly susceptible to price fluctuations.\n\nWhen housing prices eventually collapsed, financial institutions holding mortgage-backed securities suffered severe consequences. The five largest U.S. investment banks reported mortgage debts of $4.1 trillion in 2007, representing roughly 30% of the nation's GDP. This led to the fire sale of Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers' collapse, and forced Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to convert to commercial banks. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, carrying $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were ultimately placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "Exposition can be a tricky element in storytelling. While writers might feel tempted to showcase their literary prowess through lengthy explanations, this often leads to readers losing interest or becoming frustrated. Even experienced writers sometimes fall into the trap of including excessive information that doesn't serve the story.\n\nRemember: exposition isn't your ally in storytelling.\n\nWhile most writers are familiar with the golden rule \"Show, don't tell,\" it's easy to fall into the trap of writing lengthy passages where either nothing significant occurs or too much information is dumped at once. Writers often face two temptations: either rushing through background information to get to the exciting parts, or overwhelming readers with unnecessary details about characters' histories.\n\nExposition is essentially narrative explanation - telling rather than showing what happened. In movies, it often appears as information-heavy dialogue between characters, while in written fiction, it's the author directly explaining things to readers.\n\nConsider this scenario: imagine reading about a heroine's life where her meeting, marriage, and her husband's tragic murder are condensed into two pages with minimal dialogue. This approach fails to engage readers emotionally. Instead, the story should demonstrate the husband's character through his actions and words, showing how he enriched the heroine's life. This deeper characterization helps readers form an emotional connection and better understand both characters, making the tragedy more impactful.\n\nThe key is to flesh out the basic plot points with meaningful details and character development.\n\nWriters must resist the urge to rapidly list character traits and backstory (like someone's military service, current job, marital status, hobbies, and breakfast preferences) without proper development. Such information dumps often disconnect readers from the story rather than drawing them in.",
            "I analyzed two news broadcasts from NBC 4 in Columbus, Ohio on August 13, 2011. The primary story covered a domestic violence incident in Ashley, Ohio, where Shad Hostettler allegedly stabbed his wife multiple times. The brief two-minute coverage seemed appropriate given the developing nature of the story.\n\nThe broadcast then covered the critical shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area, with SWAT Team involvement and no immediate suspects. I noticed the coverage was notably brief, which appeared to reflect a concerning pattern of minimal media attention when victims are minorities, contrasting with the extensive coverage typically given to white victims.\n\nFollowing this was a report about a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter, identified as caused by a .22 caliber rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.\n\nThe weather segment briefly discussed predicted rain and thunderstorms, with weekend temperatures expected in the mid to low eighties. This seemed intentionally short to maintain viewer interest.\n\nThe coverage included a UDF store robbery on Clime Road in Columbus, where I noticed disproportionate emphasis on the suspect's race and skin tone in the description. The final story detailed the conviction of Texas Drug-Kingpin Rene Rodriguez for marijuana distribution to Ohio. Interestingly, they expressed his 25-year sentence as \"300 months\" and unnecessarily highlighted his ethnicity.",
            "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are investment vehicles that track specific market segments while offering stock-like trading flexibility. They combine the diversification benefits of index funds with stock trading features, including short selling, margin buying, and single-share purchasing options. While ETFs charge lower fees compared to typical mutual funds, investors must pay trading commissions similar to stocks. The market offers a diverse range of ETF options, though prudent investors should carefully verify claimed benefits such as diversification.\n\nThis analysis focuses on the ETF IHF, comparing it with its top 10 holdings to assess whether owning the ETF provides similar advantages to holding a diverse portfolio of its constituent stocks. We'll also explore if alternative configurations of these stocks might yield better performance metrics.\n\nFor practical purposes, our analysis concentrates on the top 10 holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. By normalizing these holdings to 100%, we can calculate how each stock contributes to the portfolio's Beta and Return, comparing these metrics to the complete ETF.\n\nThe analysis reveals that a portfolio containing just the top 10 holdings outperforms the ETF by 6.11% (a 16% return increase) while maintaining a Beta that's 0.12 lower than the full ETF. Though these results suggest superior performance from the top 10 holdings portfolio, further statistical analysis is needed to determine if the performance difference is statistically significant. This evaluation requires calculating and normalizing the standard deviation of each top 10 stock for comparison with the ETF IHF's overall standard deviation.",
            "Analysis of Figure 17 reveals a significant decline in commuter log submissions during the project's third month. This decline can be attributed to several factors. The winter season in New England naturally reduces bicycle and pedestrian commuting. The timing coincides with the fall semester's end, when the academic community is overwhelmed with final assignments and grading. The holiday season and subsequent academic break also contribute to reduced campus attendance. While these factors explain the December and January dips, the February decline remains somewhat puzzling. It's possible that this reflects a natural waning of enthusiasm following the initial project launch. To counter this downward trend, we implemented a Carpool Challenge Week in March, which successfully boosted participation.\n\nA key challenge was maintaining momentum despite both natural engagement decline and academic calendar disruptions. Additionally, we faced the deeply ingrained American cultural preference for personal vehicle use, which emphasizes convenience and independence. To encourage alternative transportation, we distributed incentives such as gift certificates to local businesses. In retrospect, offering increasingly valuable prizes throughout the project timeline - perhaps escalating from gift cards to major items like bicycles or even eco-friendly vehicles - might have been more effective in sustaining participation. While our initial incentives proved adequate, introducing progressively more substantial rewards could have prevented the observed participation decline and potentially increased engagement during traditionally low-participation periods.",
            "While examining the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I analyzed fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These productions utilized innovative editing techniques to create magical effects. My research primarily concentrated on analyzing the common characteristics of these trick films while noting some unique features that emerged in later examples. The typical trick film of this era was characterized by several conventions: it was filmed on a set, used a front-facing theatrical view, maintained a static camera position, employed long to medium camera distances, and consisted of what appeared to be a single continuous shot.\n\nThese films consistently shared the theatrical staging approach, filming indoor scenes from a fixed front view similar to a stage performance. The camera remained stationary rather than tracking the action or subjects. This style, deeply influenced by theater and magic show presentations, resulted in predominantly lateral movement of performers, who rarely approached or retreated from the camera. This is exemplified in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where actors move horizontally across the frame while the camera maintains its position.\n\nThe theatrical composition naturally led to the predominant use of long shots and occasional medium shots, completely avoiding close-ups. This mirrored the theatrical experience where audiences viewed the entire stage continuously. The middle-ground positioning of actors, who seldom moved toward the camera, eliminated any opportunity for close-up shots.\n\nMost of these early trick films appeared to consist of a single shot, typically running under a minute. This format limited their storytelling potential, resulting in brief vaudeville-style performances featuring magic tricks, disappearances, and transformations rather than complex narratives. However, what appeared as one continuous shot to viewers often comprised multiple shots cleverly edited together to create illusions. \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) demonstrates this technique, where careful observation reveals the subtle transition point where the shot of the \"severed head\" is incorporated, though it appears seamless to casual viewers.",
            "The Gothic Novel presents an inherent contradiction, combining \"old\" and \"new\" elements as noted by Ian Watt. This literary form has faced mixed reception, with critics both dismissing it as shallow and celebrating its ability to evoke the sublime, as Burke observed. Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, considered the first Gothic novel, merged classical romantic elements with modern storytelling techniques to establish the genre's foundation. Walpole blended traditional theatrical components with contemporary narrative approaches to create what he called \"A Gothic Story.\"\n\nThe genre heavily draws from medieval theatrical traditions, architectural elements, and cultural customs. By Otranto's publication, the term \"gothic\" had acquired multiple meanings across various contexts and was often viewed as primitive compared to modern developments in society and literature. The genre's enduring appeal stems from its unique fusion of theatrical Gothic elements with the novel's capacity for psychological insight, making it simultaneously timeless and contemporary for readers across different eras.\n\nChivalry emerges as a central Gothic theme, particularly in The Castle of Otranto. The medieval chivalric code, which outlined knightly conduct, is both preserved and transformed in the novel. Gothic authors, especially Walpole, emphasized chivalry to highlight the perceived decline of noble ideals in their contemporary society. This idealization of the medieval past, which foreshadowed the Romantic movement, served as a critique of present conditions. Walpole, writing during political turmoil, appeared to long for the moral certainty of the gothic era, believing it absent in his time. This perspective is evident in his characterization of Frederic, who embodies traditional chivalric virtues but is portrayed with typical Gothic excess, as seen in his depiction as a noble prince who has endured hardship and is believed to have died fighting infidels.",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the entire process of moving products from initial customer orders through raw materials, production, and final distribution. This term was first introduced by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982 to describe the comprehensive process of planning, implementing, and controlling supply chain operations to meet customer needs efficiently. The framework consists of six crucial components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information, which business managers utilize to optimize customer service.\n\nProduction, the initial phase, serves as the cornerstone of the supply chain process. During this stage, managers must determine the what, when, where, and how of production. They analyze market trends to understand customer demands, which guides decisions about product types and quantities. Once these factors are established, managers select appropriate production facilities based on volume capabilities and quality requirements, while ensuring customer satisfaction remains paramount. The production phase also involves careful planning of workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. The importance of meticulous planning in this phase cannot be overstated, as demonstrated by major retailers like Walmart and Target, which maintain detailed protocols for every aspect of their operations, from employee dress codes to shipment handling.\n\nSupply, the second key element, involves making strategic decisions about facility capabilities and potential outsourcing partnerships. Companies often operate multiple production divisions for a single product, each with its own equipment, workforce, and specialized capabilities. Managers must determine the most suitable division for each production process and may opt for outsourcing to achieve velocity – the ability to maintain quality and flexibility while optimizing costs.",
            "The Victorian era's literary landscape was dominated by novels known for their meticulous detail and aristocratic focus. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights stand apart from this convention. These works incorporate mysterious elements and unusual narratives that deviate from typical Victorian literature, which serves to enhance character development and provide deeper insights into their psychological states and motivations.\n\nThe novels frequently employ dream sequences and hallucinatory states as literary devices, though each work uses them differently. In Oliver Twist, these supernatural moments often illuminate Oliver's inner consciousness, revealing his emotional struggles and his growing understanding of his circumstances. Chapter 28's depiction of Oliver's shooting demonstrates this technique effectively. In the scene, Oliver experiences a dreamlike state where he relives the shooting, interacting with hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The passage emphasizes Oliver's powerlessness and deteriorating physical condition through his sensory confusion and persistent pain.\n\nThe scene's portrayal of Oliver's overwhelming helplessness raises questions about agency and fate. His inability to respond actively to life-threatening danger suggests both his fundamental powerlessness and the possibility that Fagin's influence has begun to erode his will to resist. The passage's description of time's distortion - with day barely existing and night becoming paradoxically both endless and brief - further reinforces the character's psychological distress and loss of control.",
            "While working as a tutor in an after-school program, I encountered a young Latino student named Adrian who struggled with reading. Despite speaking flawless English, he had unusual difficulties with certain letters. The mystery was solved when I met his Spanish-speaking mother - Adrian's reading challenges stemmed from unfamiliarity with the English alphabet rather than comprehension issues.\n\nThis experience highlights the complexities of language barriers in education, particularly in California. Even students who speak English fluently may face unexpected challenges with reading. While Adrian's situation required focused tutoring on English alphabet and pronunciation, many students with limited English proficiency need more comprehensive solutions. No single approach - whether dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, or ESL classes - can solve this issue alone. Success requires implementing multiple strategies simultaneously.\n\nThe dual language system, in particular, shows promise for all students, not just Spanish speakers. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs perform better academically than their peers. While some worry this approach wastes resources or only benefits a minority, making bilingual education standard practice would advantage everyone. Rather than requiring all teachers to be bilingual (which would be impractical), schools could employ bilingual specialists and tutors to support this approach.",
            "Most of us grow up learning about a higher power - something beyond our mortal understanding. Whether through religious institutions or personal exploration, we seek spiritual meaning. While some embrace their inherited faith, others reject it entirely, convinced that nothing exists beyond their own reality. Our spiritual journey often involves trying different belief systems as we attempt to find our place in the universe and seek guidance through life's darkness.\n\nI remember a conversation with my father on our porch during a rainstorm, sharing cigarettes as water cascaded from the gutters. When I asked about his favorite bird, he mentioned the cardinal, his gaze distant and contemplative. His illness had taken its toll - his clothes hung loose, his hair thinning. Words about his impending departure remained unspoken between us, too painful to acknowledge. Instead, we sat closer together, watching the rain fall in the growing darkness.\n\nThat December, shortly after I turned twenty-two, my father died. The aggressive treatments had only prolonged his suffering beyond the doctors' estimates, leaving me questioning the purpose of such extended pain. My faith wavered; I stopped praying, feeling abandoned by a God I no longer understood.\n\nI chose not to witness his final moments, wanting to preserve memories of his life rather than his death. Understanding him as only a child could, I knew he wouldn't want me to watch his passing. I isolated myself for three days, waiting for news of his death. The news never came through a phone call - I was left to face this profound loss in solitude.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline, though primarily a farmer, emerged as a passionate advocate for Republicanism, with his agricultural background deeply influencing his views on government, personal liberty, and civic matters. His farming perspective shaped his positions on sovereignty, constitutional interpretation, and judicial matters.\n\nTaylor saw America's unique position as advantageous, believing the absence of established traditions allowed for creating an authentic system of self-governance. He championed the interconnected nature of natural rights, arguing that compromising one right would inevitably weaken all others, thus placing them beyond governmental control. He criticized the notion that society should mirror nature's law of might-makes-right.\n\nIn Taylor's vision of an ideal society, government needed to address humanity's moral duality. He maintained that governmental systems reflect human virtues and flaws alike. His definition of positive principles centered on protecting private property, advancing agriculture, and resisting capitalism. Taylor believed that self-interest, while fundamental to human nature, became problematic only when it prioritized special interests over public welfare. He advocated for governmental oversight to check humanity's negative tendencies while remaining vigilant against corrupt principles.\n\nAs a committed Republican, Taylor advocated for strict constitutional interpretation and minimal federal authority, limiting government powers to those explicitly stated in the Constitution. He warned against an expansive federal system, seeing it as potentially tyrannical due to its cost. However, he cautioned against overly literal constitutional interpretation, emphasizing the importance of considering the founders' intent. Notably, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as the nation's true founding document, as it better reflected his view of America as a union of sovereign states rather than a single unified nation.",
            "I gazed downward, observing the scene before me with detached neutrality. My mind processed what I saw mechanically, refusing to form emotional connections. Thoughts flowed through my consciousness like water, creating an almost pure sensory experience rather than coherent reflection.\n\nI once bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" on a fellow artist's recommendation, hoping to fulfill my childhood dream of learning to draw. The book taught everything from basic tool handling to complex mental processes. One key technique involved using a frame to simplify complex scenes - turning an intricate kitchen scene into a manageable still life of a fruit bowl.\n\nIn this moment, however, I couldn't apply such artistic framing. I was too captivated by what lay before me. While great artists had their signature colors - Picasso's blue period, Monet's greens, the Renaissance masters' vibrant palettes - here was the beginning of my own artistic statement: a study in brown.\n\nMy fingers grasped my tool as I prepared for what could have been my masterpiece. The water moved gracefully, clear and pristine. Particles separated and disappeared into the current. With increasing urgency, I hit the toilet handle again, but the stubborn brown mass remained fixed to the bowl's bottom, unmoved.\n\nThere I stood in my Rite Aid uniform, green tie choking my neck, mop in hand, contemplating this unwanted \"gift\" left by some inconsiderate customer. After several unsuccessful flushes and moments of philosophical reflection, I reached for toilet paper, wrapping my hand thoroughly until it resembled protective wear. Then, like reaching for a roasting turkey, I reluctantly lowered my hand toward the bowl...",
            "Young drivers face a significant mortality risk on the roads. Multiple elements contribute to this dangerous situation affecting America's youngest motorists. Research from the National Institutes of Health indicates that adolescents' cognitive development hasn't reached the level necessary for safe driving. Lack of experience is another crucial factor, leading to higher instances of fatal crashes, vehicle flips, excessive speed, and road departures.\n\nThe presence of peer passengers significantly increases risk factors - a common scenario among teen drivers. Research conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center demonstrates a clear link between passenger age and accident frequency.\n\nWhile states like California have implemented provisional licensing systems limiting driving hours and passenger numbers for teens, these measures may be insufficient. Statistics consistently show that young drivers struggle to manage driving risks and responsibilities effectively. Research by psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, as reported in USA Today, indicates that even 18-year-olds may be too young to drive safely, citing their natural inclination toward thrill-seeking behavior. This tendency suggests that delaying driving privileges until this risk-taking propensity diminishes could be beneficial. The situation becomes more pressing considering the impending surge of new teen drivers as Baby Boomers' children reach driving age.\n\nA potential solution could involve nationwide legislation establishing 18 as the minimum driving age. This framework would maintain driver's education in schools while implementing a graduated licensing system with mandatory training hours, similar to existing state requirements like California's model of 6 hours of professional instruction and 50 hours of supervised practice. Given that teen driving statistics show similar patterns across states, implementing uniform national standards could effectively address this safety concern.\n\nThis proposed legislative approach builds upon existing concepts rather than introducing entirely new ideas.",
            "This research examines Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) across three key aspects. It begins with a definition, followed by diagnostic procedures and identifiable traits, and concludes with classroom accommodation strategies for teachers working with CAPD students in mainstream settings.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), involves the brain's ability to process auditory information effectively. While individuals with CAPD have normal hearing capabilities, their brains struggle to properly interpret and process auditory inputs, such as distinguishing between different sounds or filtering out background noise.\n\nThe disorder was first identified in the 1950s under the term \"auditory imperception.\" Italian scientists Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari pioneered testing methods in 1954, followed by Kimura's breakthrough in dichotic testing in 1961. A significant 1977 national conference sparked increased research interest in pediatric CAPD.\n\nCAPD symptoms are diverse, including difficulties with: sound localization, distinguishing between different sounds, recognizing sound patterns, detecting vocal nuances (like sarcasm), processing sequential sounds, synthesizing audio information meaningfully, and processing sounds in the correct order.\n\nDiagnosis requires comprehensive evaluation through various methods, including behavioral observations and auditory function assessments. Multiple professionals, such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists, may be involved in the diagnostic process. Currently, there is no single standardized diagnostic tool, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Diagnostic procedures often involve tests with multiple simultaneous audio stimuli, requiring patients to differentiate specific elements, and may include sophisticated acoustic response measurements.",
            "My goal in pursuing social work education is to build a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on supporting troubled families and protecting abused or neglected children. I bring essential qualities to the social work profession, including dedication to service, respectful behavior, ethical conduct, and a commitment to fostering better relationships while maintaining professional growth. These principles aren't merely professional requirements – they reflect my personal values.\n\nMy journey to social work wasn't straightforward. During my academic years, I observed many peers avoiding their problems or adopting unhealthy coping mechanisms, which led me to earn a Psychology degree from Piedmont College in 2009. A pivotal moment occurred that summer when I met a teenage boy seeking refuge from abusive parents at a friend's house. After he reported his parents to the police, I visited their home to help. When speaking with the officers and parents, I noticed the parents' defensive behavior as they dismissed serious family conflicts as \"simple disputes.\" This experience crystallized my decision to pursue social work, specifically to advocate for children in troubled family situations.\n\nSocial justice is another cornerstone of my professional and personal philosophy. I've always questioned society's paradoxical approach to individuality – claiming to value it while simultaneously promoting conformity. Throughout my academic years, I actively challenged social injustice through various forms of self-expression: sporting unconventional hair colors, embracing unique fashion choices, getting multiple piercings, openly supporting LGBTQ+ rights through GSBA involvement, and consistently opposing racism and discrimination. My commitment to social justice remains unwavering, and I continue to stand against societal inequities.",
            "This paper examines insomnia through the lens of both Biological and Sociocultural models. While the biological perspective examines inherited genetic factors and medical conditions, the sociocultural approach investigates how environmental factors, including race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status, influence the condition. The paper analyzes various research studies related to these models and evaluates their strengths and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified into three main categories: primary sleep disorders, those connected to other mental disorders, and those linked to various other causes. Primary sleep disorders are further divided into Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while mental disorder-related sleep issues are connected to Axis I or Axis II conditions. Medical conditions or substance use can cause other sleep disorders. Dyssomnias include several conditions, notably Primary Insomnia (difficulty sleeping) and Primary Hypersomnia (difficulty staying awake), both requiring a month-long duration for diagnosis. Other conditions include Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia NOS. Parasomnias, which involve abnormal behaviors or physiological events during sleep, include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias NOS.\n\nThe biological model emphasizes the role of genetics and physiology in sleep disorders. Research has shown that orexin-containing neurons in the hypothalamus control sleep-wake cycles, with GABAB receptors playing a crucial role. Studies on mice demonstrated that GABAA receptor activation promotes sleep, while GABAB agonists increase sleep duration. These findings suggest potential genetic and environmental influences on human sleep patterns, with receptor dysfunction potentially requiring medical intervention. Such biological factors can significantly impact an individual's daily functioning, affecting their academic, professional, and personal lives.",
            "As a student who has spent over two years at University Park, I've experienced firsthand the challenges of campus navigation. My experience began in East Halls, situated at the campus's eastern edge, where a simple journey to central locations like Willard building could consume nearly half an hour on foot, particularly during State College's frequently adverse weather conditions. The campus has undergone significant transformation - what was once vacant land surrounding East Halls has been developed into athletic fields, modern facilities like the new Creamery and health services building, and residential complexes. This expansion has made campus navigation increasingly challenging.\n\nThe optimal solution to this mobility challenge is cycling, though its effectiveness depends on both student participation and appropriate infrastructure. This perspective was reinforced by a conversation with a friend who had recently returned to cycling, acknowledging its practicality and efficiency. Bicycling not only promotes physical health but also represents the most energy-efficient mode of transportation - a simple breakfast can fuel a 30-mile journey.\n\nLiving off-campus now, at a distance comparable to some dorms, I've found that purchasing a bicycle was an extremely wise choice. It has transformed what would be a 25-minute walk to Thomas building into a mere 5-minute ride. While Pollock Road offers the most direct route, it presents its own challenges for cyclists. Though walking remains an option, it's impractical for my schedule. Without a bicycle, I would spend an additional 2.5 hours weekly just walking to and from Thomas building alone, not counting other campus destinations. This significant time investment makes cycling not just convenient, but necessary for managing my busy schedule efficiently.",
            "In Brave New World, Aldous Huxley presents a critique of advancing technology and capitalism through a dystopian society where communal values supersede individual identity, and instant gratification is the primary goal. The World Controller manipulates the population, who are essentially trapped within a prescribed way of thinking. Through a Marxist interpretation, the novel reveals Huxley's skepticism toward these developing systems, employing concepts like homogeneity and reification to comment on contemporary economic trends.\n\nThe novel illustrates the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where the masses are kept ignorant of true class relationships due to their focus on personal gain. This is demonstrated through the conditioning of lower castes (Delta, Gamma, etc.), who are programmed through hypnopædia to perpetually consume and indulge. The concept of hegemony is evident as the ruling class maintains complete control over subordinate classes, who unknowingly support the capitalistic structure. While upper classes (Alphas and Betas) have the potential for awareness, most, except for few individuals like Bernard, accept their predetermined roles without question.\n\nThe novel portrays a world devoid of meaningful personal connections, with characters lacking psychological depth – possibly suggesting that the combination of technology and capitalism strips humanity of its essence. Genuine emotions, including love, are absent, replaced by superficial interactions characterized by physical observations and casual sexual encounters. The various social classes' acceptance of their positions reflects capitalism's socioeconomic impact, with each group conditioned to believe in their purpose while continuing to consume and conform, exemplifying the Marxist view of how the proletariat is manipulated through false consciousness.",
            "Reflecting on a college course about Islam I took nearly four years ago, I remember how we debated whether Islam was inherently hostile - a question that remains particularly relevant today. The media's portrayal of Islam has notably shifted from post-9/11 hostility to what seems like excessive accommodation, exemplified by the historic presidency bid of Barack Obama, despite his family's Muslim connections.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography presents an interesting contradiction to my previous understanding of his character. While historical accounts I'm familiar with portrayed him as someone who forcibly converted conquered peoples to Islam, the biography depicts him as a misunderstood, humble figure whose teachings naturally attracted followers.\n\nI noticed striking parallels between Jesus's ministry and Muhammad's reported miracles, such as the story of multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men. This narrative approach seems designed to present Muhammad as a modest prophet who performed miracles matter-of-factly. However, this appears to diminish Jesus's unique miracles and ministry by creating similar stories around Muhammad.\n\nThe biography frequently relies on chain-narrative testimonials about conversions to Islam, where stories are passed down through multiple sources. Rather than strengthening the authenticity of these accounts, this method of storytelling actually makes them seem less credible.\n\nMost concerning is the biography's portrayal of Muhammad as a humble, wise, and gentle religious leader, which appears to conflict with historical records of his rise to power. This raises questions about whether contemporary Muslims are aware of the historical context of Muhammad's ascension to leadership.",
            "Christianity rapidly diverged from Jesus's original teachings after his death, with successive generations moving increasingly away from its initial form. Today, despite resistance from traditionalists, there's a growing progressive consciousness that may lead to significant changes in Christian thought. In the coming years, Christians are likely to develop a stronger interest in distinguishing between original teachings and later additions to their faith. This will eventually trigger a massive reversal in Christian history, with believers gradually stripping away accumulated doctrines to rediscover Jesus's original message.\n\nThis movement will likely spread throughout Western nations, prompting people to worship in ways that mirror early Christianity. While churches will maintain their institutional importance, the current diversity in Christian denominations will gradually give way to greater uniformity in beliefs and practices. This pattern of dramatic historical reversals isn't unprecedented – consider how the Roman Empire shifted from persecuting Christians to embracing Christianity, or how America evolved from slavery to having African-American leaders.\n\nThis religious transformation will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus's teachings metaphorically rather than literally. To understand this evolution, we must look back to Christianity's roots in Judaism. Before the Roman occupation of Jerusalem in 63 BCE, Judaism had already established its core principles of monotheism, divine revelation, and biblical authority. The Jewish community was diverse, split between various groups including Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general population.",
            "Through the lens of The Jungle, we can observe humanity's inherent selfishness and greed. The novel illustrates how people prioritize their own advancement while disregarding those beneath them in social status. This theme is particularly evident in the portrayal of factory owners and managers, who relentlessly pursue corporate growth and profits with complete disregard for collateral damage.\n\nSinclair vividly depicts this through imagery of industrial devastation, describing factories with \"great chimneys\" spewing endless streams of smoke into the sky. This portrayal emphasizes the owners' indifference to environmental damage and public health, as they ignore the consequences of industrial pollution and unsanitary conditions in Packingtown's animal pens.\n\nThe exploitation extends deeply into labor practices. The workplace is described as a \"seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds\" where profit consistently trumps human dignity. Workers face arbitrary layoffs, dangerous working conditions, and exhausting schedules, with no job security or protective regulations. The absence of labor laws during this period allowed management to prioritize productivity over worker safety and wellbeing.\n\nThe situation in Packingtown created a system of de facto slavery, particularly affecting poor immigrants. Workers were trapped in a cycle of poverty and exploitation, with no meaningful support systems or legitimate organizations to defend their rights. While labor unions existed, they often exploited rather than helped workers. The novel draws a direct parallel between these industrial workers and chattel slavery, noting that under such desperate conditions, where survival depends on the whims of ruthless employers, moral degradation becomes inevitable.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-land\" among his finest poetic works. The poem features the word \"Thulé\" twice, which has historical roots in Virgil's writings about a mysterious northern island beyond Britain that marked the boundary of the ancient Greek world. While Virgil's influence is undeniable, there's a more contemporary source worth noting, given Poe's known appreciation of German literature.\n\nThis connection is particularly significant as it demonstrates Poe's knowledge of Goethe's work. Scholar Karl J. Arndt has noted the similarities between their poetry, suggesting Poe drew inspiration from Goethe.\n\nGoethe, as noted in the Oxford Companion to English Literature, was renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two segments (1808 and 1832). Within \"Faust Part Two\" lies \"The King of Thulé,\" a poignant tale about a grieving king who, after receiving a goblet from his dying wife, succumbs to drinking and eventually chooses death, throwing the cherished goblet into the ocean. The parallels between this king and the narrator in \"Dream-Land\" suggest a possible reflection of Poe's own struggles with loss and alcohol.\n\nPoe uses \"Thule\" in both \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land,\" with the latter featuring it prominently as bookends. Reading \"Dream-Land\" alongside \"The King of Thulé\" reveals striking thematic similarities: both works explore themes of darkness, loneliness, and haunting memories. The speaker in \"Dream-Land\" seems to inhabit the same melancholic world as Goethe's king.\n\nPoe's familiarity with Goethe would have been natural, not only through the German author's various contemporary adaptations but also through Poe's admiration of Tennyson, who was known to appreciate Goethe's work.",
            "This case examines whether punitive damages could be awarded in California for a slip-and-fall incident at D&D Markets. The incident occurred when Jennifer Palmer fell on an unremedied applesauce spill, resulting in serious back injuries. The store manager, Paul Martin, had been notified twice about the spill but ignored it for 30 minutes while on his dinner break.\n\nThe legal analysis suggests Palmer's punitive damage claim would likely survive summary dismissal. Under California Civil Code § 3294(a), punitive damages can be awarded if a defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Malice is defined as either intentional harm or \"despicable\" conduct showing willful disregard for others' safety. The precedent set in Taylor v. Superior Court establishes that malicious conduct includes cases where defendants are aware of probable dangers but deliberately fail to address them.\n\nPalmer's case is strengthened by several factors: The manager was notified twice about the hazard, six similar accidents had occurred at the store in 2009, and Martin deliberately ignored the situation despite knowing the risks. While proving the conduct was \"despicable\" might be challenging, Palmer can make a reasonable argument that Martin's conscious disregard for customer safety, especially given the store's history of accidents, meets the legal threshold for punitive damages under California law.",
            "There was an emptiness within her that persisted, starting at age 14 and continuing through her seventeenth year. As time passed, she realized it wasn't a thing she yearned for, but rather a person. Curiously, despite receiving attention from various boys, none sparked her interest. This peculiarity led to considerable self-reflection, though she never reached any satisfactory conclusions about her romantic indifference. She simply continued living while pondering these feelings.\n\nHer home life was typically serene, with parents who rarely quarreled, either with each other or with her. The only occasional tensions arose from her strong-willed, independent nature. While her parents embodied tranquility, she possessed a vibrant, outgoing personality that, combined with her kindness, made her well-liked by others.\n\nHowever, this particular day shattered their usual peace when her mother's scream echoed from the kitchen. Rushing to investigate, she found her mother sprawled on the floor, clearly in agony. Between labored breaths, her mother requested to be taken to the hospital. Thanks to her strength training, she managed to carry her mother to the car and place her in the backseat.\n\nAt the hospital, despite the typical clinical atmosphere heavy with anxiety and antiseptic, she remained focused solely on her mother's wellbeing. She rushed in carrying her mother, calling urgently for medical assistance. Healthcare workers quickly transferred her mother to a gurney and whisked her away for examination, leaving the daughter to wait anxiously.\n\nThe incident, it turned out, had occurred when her mother fell while trying to retrieve a vase from the topmost cabinet using a stepstool.",
            "The research aimed to demonstrate that following a Mediterranean Diet (Med diet), measured by the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" helps reduce the likelihood of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and related deaths. The aMed diet, a variation of the traditional Mediterranean diet, emphasizes consuming more plant-based foods (fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, but not potatoes), fish, and monounsaturated fats while limiting animal products and saturated fats. It also permits moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious research has shown that following a Mediterranean diet is linked to lower overall and cardiovascular mortality rates. Additionally, a clinical trial demonstrated that the Med diet was superior to low-fat diets in achieving weight loss and improving cholesterol ratios in obese people. However, these earlier studies didn't specifically examine stroke outcomes.\n\nThe investigation tracked 74,886 female nurses aged 38-63 years, who had no previous cardiovascular disease or diabetes, as part of the larger Nurses' Health Study involving 121,700 women across 11 US states. Between 1984 and 2004, researchers calculated aMed diet scores six times using validated food frequency questionnaires (FFQs). The study maintained over 95% participation throughout its 20-year duration. Cases of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical records, autopsies, or death certificates, with some cases (17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal heart attacks) classified as \"probable\" when records were unavailable.\n\nTo better represent long-term dietary patterns, researchers used cumulative averages of aMed scores from repeated FFQs. They controlled for potential confounding factors including age, smoking, body mass index, hormonal factors, supplement use, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, they analyzed the relationship between aMed scores and cardiovascular outcomes. The results showed that women with higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet had significantly lower risks of both CHD and stroke. Over the 20-year study period, they documented 2,391 CHD cases, 1,763 stroke cases, and 1,077 cardiovascular deaths. Women in the highest aMed score category showed a 29% lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest category.",
            "A photo captures actress Ellen Page (now known as Elliot Page) holding a cardboard sign with an unsettling message linking Hitler to Burma. Burma (Myanmar), a Southeast Asian nation, has been under military control since a 1962 coup. In 2007, the country witnessed its first major protests in ten years, dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution\" due to the Buddhist monks' distinctive robes who led the demonstrations. While initially peaceful, these protests escalated into violent confrontations between monks and the military regime, which began raiding monasteries nationwide. Foreign media faced severe persecution, exemplified by the killing of Japanese photographer Kenji Nagai. Though official records cite 13 deaths, defected Colonel Hla Win suggested thousands were actually killed.\n\nThis pattern of governmental oppression isn't unique to modern times. Throughout history, rulers have sought absolute control over their populations. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, Japanese emperors were considered deities, and modern political leaders often align themselves with influential religious figures to maintain power.\n\nSimilar instances of authoritarian violence include the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in China, where casualty figures vary dramatically between government reports (200-300) and Red Cross estimates (2,000-3,000). The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s saw government-backed Hutu militias systematically eliminating Tutsis and political moderates. The Holocaust under Hitler's Third Reich, targeting Jews across multiple countries, stands as another devastating example of state-sponsored violence.",
            "Duke Ellington's influence on jazz is primarily attributed to his enduring career and exceptional ability to mold his orchestra's sound. While his piano work may be understated in many compositions, his genius as a composer shone through in creating intricate pieces that capitalized on his musicians' individual talents. He expertly designed musical frameworks that balanced structured orchestration with room for improvisation, tailoring parts to highlight each band member's unique style. This approach resulted in distinctive orchestral sounds that perfectly suited each composition. His deep understanding of both individual musicians and ensemble dynamics enabled him to create some of jazz's most groundbreaking works.\n\nCreole Love Call, as noted in the Grove Music dictionary, exemplifies Ellington's innovative use of vocals as a pure instrumental element, free from lyrics. This twelve-bar blues composition, structured in six choruses, demonstrates his skill in complementing soloists:\n\nThe first chorus features an interplay between voice and reeds, evolving from smooth to rougher tones.\nThe second showcases a muted trumpet solo expanding on the main melody.\nThe third presents a high-register clarinet solo with subtle piano accompaniment.\nThe fourth involves the full band recreating the opening chorus's call-and-response pattern.\nThe fifth reaches its peak with high-register reeds leading the call-and-response.\nThe sixth revisits the opening structure but incorporates vocal \"growl\" technique.\nThe piece concludes with a brief tag combining a vocal run and dissonant trombone ending.\n\nThis innovative vocal approach became a hallmark of Ellington's style, as evidenced in later works like Hot and Bothered, where he masterfully blended Bubber Miley's muted trumpet with Baby Cox's scat singing. This technique evolved further in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone introduces the melody, showcasing Ellington's continued exploration of unique instrumental voices.",
            "What factors determine evolutionary patterns in organisms, and what limitations might shape evolutionary trajectories? Despite D'Arcy Thompson's 1917 observation about the lack of mathematical descriptions for biological forms - an observation that remains relevant today - progress has been made in applying mathematical models to understand mollusk shell development, both in individual growth and evolutionary history.\n\nOur research investigates how mathematical modeling of developmental and evolutionary changes in Prunum, combined with experimental work, can reveal mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental modifications. We analyzed X-ray images of Prunum species to identify measurable characteristics that could be used to model both theoretical and actual shell shapes using the CerioShell software. By modeling potential shell forms, we explored the boundaries of possible morphological variations in Prunum, integrating these findings with experimental and observational studies to better comprehend major evolutionary changes in this group.\n\nA mollusk shell can be conceptualized as a tube that rotates through space, creating 360-degree turns called whorls around a central axis (the columella). The growth rate of these whorls can vary, with suture lines marking the boundaries between them. The final whorl, known as the body whorl, is typically the largest, while the spire encompasses all previous whorls. The shell structure extends from the apex (top) to the base, with the aperture serving as the opening for the animal.\n\nShells can be examined from multiple angles: apical (top), basal (bottom), apertural (front), and abapertural (back). The standard presentation shows the aperture facing the viewer with the apex pointing upward. Whorl counting begins from the initial suture line when viewed from above, with measurements made to the nearest quarter whorl.\n\nThe shell's development can be understood as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. This growth pattern can be tracked using coordinates of aperture centers and their dimensions, allowing for mathematical representation and manipulation of shell development parameters.",
            "Indonesia's progress in reducing infant and neonatal mortality has been minimal over the past decade. Despite achieving several Millennium Development Goals, particularly in water and sanitation, the country's improvements in maternal and child health fall significantly behind target expectations for 2015. This underperformance stems from various factors that suggest a need for comprehensive health system enhancement rather than isolated program interventions.\n\nWhile Indonesia has achieved 72% coverage of births attended by skilled health workers, this figure includes traditional practitioners like midwives who lack capabilities to handle medical complications, particularly hemorrhage cases. This statistic, therefore, presents an overly optimistic picture of progress. Furthermore, there's been a reduction in professional treatment of childhood diarrhea cases, and postnatal care remains inadequate nationwide.\n\nThe country's cesarean section rate of 4% is below expected levels, with a notable urban-rural disparity (7% vs. 2%). This highlights significant geographical inequities in healthcare access. Additionally, a 27% gap in healthcare utilization exists between the wealthiest and poorest population segments, suggesting financial barriers to access, primarily due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn addressing these maternal and neonatal care challenges, Indonesia faces a strategic choice between targeted programmatic interventions and broader health system strengthening. While vertical, program-specific approaches offer focused objectives and quick results, they have significant drawbacks. These include resource diversion from other health sectors (as seen in HIV/AIDS funding impact on family planning), staff concentration in well-funded areas, and service duplication across uncoordinated programs, leading to increased administrative burden.",
            "Over the last century, Popular Music has evolved into such a vast array of genres that creating an exhaustive list has become challenging. Each major genre - including rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk - has developed numerous subdivisions and further subcategories. Heavy Metal rock, in particular, has emerged as one of popular music's most varied and emotionally rich genres in the past four decades. While often exploring darker themes, it demonstrates remarkable emotional range and adaptability. This flexibility has led to continuous branching into new sub-genres, creating an ongoing evolution that continues today.\n\nThe heavy metal landscape has become so diverse that defining its core characteristics has grown increasingly complex. While it has absorbed influences from various musical styles, understanding its origins is crucial. To comprehend contemporary metal music's widespread presence, one must grasp both its nature as a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal distinguishes itself as a movement characterized by intensity and darkness. It can be described as music of excess - featuring amplified bass, increased volume, heightened aggression, and theatrical elements. Unlike primitive music forms, metal demands technical proficiency, with musicians demonstrating exceptional instrumental skills. The movement was significantly influenced by the psychedelic drug culture of the mid-1970s, which led to experimental, otherworldly recordings. Metal introduced unprecedented dark, visceral qualities to popular music, which traditionally avoided such emotional territory. Modern metal also draws inspiration from the dark themes prevalent in the Romantic Era. This darkness is exemplified in various lyrics, including those from \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles, which some consider an early heavy metal song. The Beatles created this darker, heavier track to compete with the Rolling Stones' sound, including it on their White Album.",
            "Several decades prior to Surrealism's emergence, Henri Rousseau was already creating his own visionary artworks. His 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, carries dual significance - depicting both a woman's mystical dream experience and symbolizing Rousseau's personal artistic aspirations. Throughout his career, he yearned for artistic recognition while grappling with a fundamental choice: whether to adopt conventional painting styles for acceptance or maintain his distinctive creative voice.\n\nTo understand The Dream's significance, context about Rousseau's life is essential. Born in 1844 in Laval, France, to a moderately successful tinsmith, Rousseau lacked formal artistic training. Until age forty, he worked as a municipal toll collector, often mistakenly called a customs inspector. Personal tragedy marked his life, with his first wife Clémence's death following the loss of eight children, leaving him with just one daughter, Julia. Art became his solace and new beginning. Unlike his contemporaries who idealized peasant life in their works, Rousseau's perspective reflected his working-class background and aspirations.\n\nHis desire for artistic acceptance becomes more comprehensible given his circumstances: he began painting late in life without formal training, competing alongside established modern artists. Despite years of work, recognition came late, around the same time Matisse was gaining prominence. As Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters, their motivations differed fundamentally: while Matisse sought to avoid artistic conventionality, Rousseau desperately wanted to create conventional art that would earn him acceptance into the Artiste Français.",
            "Throughout history, philosophers have noted a profound relationship between moral principles and artistic beauty. This connection appears to stem from a deeper truth, as captured in Keats' famous lines from \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" about the unity of beauty and truth. Unlike conventional knowledge acquired through formal education or life experiences, our understanding of ethics and aesthetics seems to come from a more intuitive place. Both fields aim to describe rather than dictate, attempting to explain why we find certain actions moral or certain works beautiful, instead of providing strict guidelines.\n\nWhen analyzing art or moral behavior, we often find that conventional explanations fall short. Take the Mona Lisa, for instance - while we can discuss its technical aspects and historical significance, these elements alone don't fully explain its artistic merit. People often preface their appreciation of art with phrases like \"There's just something about it,\" suggesting an ineffable quality. This same phenomenon applies to moral understanding. As O'Connor suggests with storytelling, some truths can only be conveyed through indirect means, and both artistic and ethical appreciation possess elements that defy complete analytical description.\n\nThe connection between morality and art is particularly strong because both operate on a deeper, almost mystical level that we can experience but struggle to fully articulate - what Kant would call the noumenal realm. This relationship is especially evident in literature, which uniquely combines artistic expression with moral significance. As McKean points out, literature's distinctive feature is its moral dimension, making it particularly relevant to human experience since both living and literature inherently involve value judgments and ethical considerations.",
            "Modern Germany represents a unified nation with a distinctive cultural identity that spans from Munich near the Alps to Kiel by the Baltic Sea, and from Cologne along the Rhine to Dresden on the Elbe. This cohesive culture emerged from diverse tribal origins and multiple historical influences.\n\nThe ancestral homeland, Germania, has a name whose origins remain debated among academics. According to Tacitus, the name derived from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe that was known as Germans before their Rhine crossing and conflicts with the Gauls. The term \"Germanus\" was first documented by Julius Caesar in his Gallic Wars chronicles, borrowed from the Gauls to differentiate between conquered and unconquered peoples. Various theories suggest the name could mean \"neighbor\" in Gaulish, reference their \"ger\" spear, or stem from the Old Irish \"garim\" (to shout).\n\nTacitus's 98 AD work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" portrayed the Germans as indigenous people, largely unmixed with other groups. He argued that Germany's harsh climate and wild landscape made it an unlikely destination for voluntary migration from more hospitable regions like Asia, Africa, or Italy.\n\nEven the Romans maintained a limited presence in Germania, primarily engaging in trade and occasional military campaigns rather than permanent settlement. Germanic tribes, emerging in the mid-first century, established themselves along the Roman Empire's borders, trading goods and offering their military service to the Roman army while maintaining their independence.",
            "Shakespeare's Twelfth Night explores how disguise, while effective for temporary deception, ultimately demands resolution lest one's true identity becomes permanently obscured. The aftermath of revealing such deception often leads to social complications, forcing individuals to choose between maintaining their authentic selves or preserving their relationships. While some people might accept the revelation of deception gracefully, others may feel betrayed and respond with hostility.\n\nThe theme of gender-based deception raises particularly complex questions, primarily regarding motivation. In the case of Viola, her cross-dressing serves as a survival strategy in unfamiliar territory, as evidenced when she acknowledges the captain's help in preserving her safety through this disguise. However, this protective measure comes at a cost, isolating her from female companionship and creating unexpected romantic complications. Her convincing male persona leads to Olivia's misplaced affections and creates a complex dynamic with Orsino, who struggles with his feelings for someone he believes to be male.\n\nFor contemporary audiences, the play can be interpreted as an exploration of how deception can unveil hidden desires and emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. While one might question whether Olivia's attraction to Cesario suggests repressed same-sex desires, it's more likely that Shakespeare intended to satirize the superficiality of attraction based solely on appearances. This interpretation is supported by Olivia's quick transition of affections from Cesario to Sebastian, and her eventual acceptance of Viola as a sister rather than a romantic interest.",
            "The German colonial empire's legacy is complex, particularly regarding its educational policies across different territories. While infamous for acts of brutality, such as the Ovaherero and Nama genocide in German South West Africa, the empire's administrative approaches varied significantly by region. For instance, when British forces assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a considerable number of well-educated African inhabitants. Similar educational achievements were documented in Kamerun and other German colonies.\n\nHowever, German South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) developed quite differently. Unlike East Africa's government-led educational system, South West Africa delegated native education primarily to missionary organizations, offering them minimal state support. Conversely, the colonial government heavily invested in European settlers' education, creating state schools and providing substantial support to missionary institutions serving white colonists. This disparity resulted in lasting educational inequalities, with most of the native population remaining illiterate, unlike in other German colonies.\n\nThe academic literature on education in German colonies is extensive, with early 20th-century German sources focusing mainly on describing educational systems. Later English-language studies introduced comparative analyses and explored specific aspects of colonial education. Cohen's research, comparing South West Africa and East Africa, particularly emphasizes how the large settler population in South West Africa influenced its distinct educational approach.\n\nSouth West Africa's relatively moderate climate, despite its desert regions, attracted a significant European population. By 1913, it hosted nearly 15,000 white settlers, almost triple the European population in East Africa, the next most populated German colony. This demographic pattern significantly influenced the territory's social and educational policies.",
            "The United States and Mexico experienced a significant rivalry lasting 57 years (1836-1893), as noted by Diehl and Goerts (2000). This conflict reached its peak during the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), resulting in the US annexation of Texas and the Southwest. The antagonism, which persisted until just before WWI, was rooted in religious, cultural, and material differences between the two nations (Schmitt 1974).\n\nThis pattern is common among neighboring countries, where shared borders often lead to conflicting interests and rivalries. According to Pletcher (1977), Mexico and Cuba stand out as the only Latin American nations with sustained diplomatic tensions with the United States, while other countries in the region maintained positive relations.\n\nReligious differences played a crucial role in the conflict. Frahm (2001) notes that American opposition to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries paralleled their later resistance to fascism and communism. This religious-ideological divide, similar to the US-Soviet tensions during the Cold War, stemmed from inherited Anglo-Spanish antagonisms that complicated diplomatic relations between the two nations.\n\nDuring the 57-year rivalry period, Diehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 disputes, primarily involving territorial issues and border security problems. Both nations eventually had to deploy military forces to address cross-border bandit activity (Schmitt 1974).\n\nThe rivalry gradually diminished as Mexico became economically dependent on the United States, and American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic influence in Mexico during the late 19th century (Schmitt 1974).",
            "An unexpected illness left me disabled at age 46, completely transforming my life. As a nurse - a career I had chosen for its promised stability rather than pursuing my dreams of science or journalism - I found myself unable to work and financially vulnerable.\n\nAfter 15 years on disability benefits, I've lost nearly everything I once owned. Though I manage to survive, each day brings new challenges to my sense of security and self-worth. What's become crystal clear is that I couldn't have endured without the support of family and friends. When crisis hits, even the strongest among us need help.\n\nLife's emergencies, both major and minor, are inevitable. No matter how well-prepared we are, some challenges are simply too enormous to face alone. While I agree that Americans shouldn't rely solely on government support - which is already strained - I believe the solution lies in rebuilding community trust and mutual aid rather than isolating ourselves in individual preparation.\n\nThe common narrative about America being built on \"rugged individualism\" is misleading. Our ancestors survived through community, compassion, and resource-sharing. The pioneer wagons reached their destination through cooperation, not isolation.\n\nI advocate for personal preparedness - I maintain emergency supplies, from first-aid kits to non-perishable food. If you can manage sustainable living through farming or food preservation, that's wonderful. But more importantly, invest in your community relationships.\n\nThe real key to survival isn't just stockpiling supplies - it's building connections with those around you.",
            "Around 2500 years ago, in the 5th or 6th century BCE, the man who would become known as the Buddha was born into royalty. His journey to enlightenment and subsequent teachings formed the foundation of Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism emerging as its most traditional branch. The religion has evolved considerably since its inception, as evidenced in practices like Sri Lanka's annual water-cutting ceremony, which, despite having no direct connection to Buddha's original teachings, has become an important religious event for both monks and laypeople. These evolutionary changes extend beyond mere customs to affect the fundamental salvation principles of the faith. The Theravada Buddhist community has adapted its theological principles over time in response to various influences, both from within and outside the faith, some supportive and others antagonistic.\n\nFor clarity, several key terms require definition. Forces originating from within the Buddhasasana (Buddhist community), regardless of whether from monks or laypeople, are considered internal. Those from non-Buddhist sources are external. Hostile forces are those that aim to harm or undermine Buddhism, while benign forces are neutral in intent, though their effects may ultimately help or harm the faith.\n\nThe fundamental principles of Theravada Buddhism center on the triple gem: Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha. The Dhamma is preserved in the Tripitaka, or three baskets of Buddhist scripture: the Sutta Pitaka (discourses), Vinaya Pitaka (disciplinary rules), and Abhidhamma Pitaka (metaphysical teachings). Core concepts include Anatta (non-self), Dukkha (suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Understanding these principles is essential for ending Sansara (the cycle of rebirth) and eliminating lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The religion prescribes behavioral guidelines: five precepts for laypeople (prohibiting killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxication) and additional rules for monks. The foundation of Buddhist doctrine lies in the four noble truths, beginning with the recognition of suffering, its cause in attachment, and the possibility of its cessation."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.

            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Cultural understanding is essential in negotiations, though culture itself defies simple definition. Rather than being a uniform entity, culture is complex and multifaceted. It's misleading to make sweeping generalizations about national characteristics, such as claiming all people from a particular country share identical traits. Instead, negotiators should focus on understanding how specific cultural aspects influence the negotiation process and interpret these through the lens of their own cultural background.\n\nSuccessfully navigating cultural differences requires comprehensive understanding, from historical context to inherent biases. Rather than criticizing or attempting to modify cultural norms, negotiators should accept and work within them, particularly when in a disadvantaged position. When negotiating in unfamiliar cultural territory, showing respect for local customs and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers.\n\nCultural differences exist not only between nations but also within organizations. Corporate cultures can vary significantly, even within the same country, manifesting in different work schedules, dress codes, communication styles, and philanthropic approaches. Even within American companies, cultural variations can be observed across different regions and settings, demonstrating the complexity of cultural diversity within a single society. While some cultures may appear more homogeneous, deeper examination often reveals subtle variations.\n\nUnderstanding cultural values is crucial as they explain behavioral motivations. For instance, in cultures prioritizing face-saving and group harmony, negotiators won't risk public embarrassment to achieve success. Similarly, those from cultures valuing aggressive negotiation may resist quick settlements. While these cultural patterns are important to consider, successful negotiators also recognize the importance of understanding their counterparts on an individual level.",
            "The passage \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" appears in Psalm 14 and serves as the foundation for both St. Anselm's and Thomas Aquinas's arguments for God's existence. To effectively compare their perspectives, we must accept their shared premise of the Biblical God's existence, rather than considering alternative divine concepts. While both philosophers present compelling arguments, neither provides a complete foundation for divine belief.\n\nSt. Anselm's approach centers on finding divine proof through internal reflection and faith. His argument suggests that since we can comprehend God in our understanding, we cannot truly conceive of His non-existence. Though sometimes complex in its expression, his core message is that divine proof resides within human consciousness, requiring no external validation. This internal validation approach exemplifies the Christian concept of faith.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas proposes that God's existence can be demonstrated purely through rational thinking and observable evidence, without requiring faith. This approach would particularly benefit Christian evangelism, as it could convince potential converts through pure logic rather than requiring acceptance of unprovable concepts. Aquinas presents five logical arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. His methodology resembles completing a puzzle - even with one piece missing, you can deduce its characteristics and existence through logical reasoning based on the surrounding pieces.",
            "Authors employ various literary devices to evoke specific emotions or perspectives in their readers, with some methods proving more successful than others. In The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald demonstrates masterful use of these techniques. He creates unique effects by combining unexpected adjectives with nouns and by developing symbolic meanings through color imagery. Particularly notable is his use of colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. Throughout the novel, Fitzgerald carefully constructs meaning around these colors, especially white/gray and red/pink, using them to trigger specific emotional responses when readers encounter important elements of the story.\n\nThe white/gray color scheme in Fitzgerald's work represents conformity and standardization, with white suggesting refinement and higher social status, while gray indicates aging and deterioration. This symbolism is established early in the novel through repeated references. Characters frequently appear in white attire - Daisy and Jordan are consistently described \"in white,\" Nick dons \"white flannels\" for Gatsby's gathering, Tom appears in a \"white shirt\" during his meeting with Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white.\" The only notable exception occurs during Nick's observations of Gatsby's party, where \"primary colors\" dominate the scene. Fitzgerald reinforces these color associations by applying them to mundane elements: New York's streets become \"white chasms,\" party guests' names fade to \"gray names,\" and Catherine's living space is depicted as part of a uniform \"white cake of apartment-houses.\"\n\nHaving established these color associations, Fitzgerald strategically employs them to convey deeper meaning, particularly in characterizing Daisy. After a period without significant color references, Fitzgerald deliberately presents Daisy \"dressed in white\" in a \"white roadster,\" encouraging readers to view her as a symbol of conformity rather than a fully developed character - merely an object of Gatsby's desire. This characterization is further reinforced through additional white and gray imagery, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and her \"white\" dress before the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",

Many organic operations enhance their revenue by offering educational tours and recreational activities, allowing landowners to benefit from government initiatives while supporting wildlife habitat and creating additional income streams.\n\nWhile organic farming promotes greater biodiversity through chemical-free practices, it comes with unique challenges. These include higher labor costs, more intensive management requirements, and potentially lower yields compared to conventional farming. Additional wildlife-friendly practices, such as cover cropping and strategic grazing, further increase operational costs, making financial assistance and expert guidance valuable for balancing profitability with habitat preservation.\n\nThe case study focuses on a 160-acre property near Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. The land, comprising chaparral, Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This area provides habitat for numerous endangered and threatened species, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat and California gnatcatcher.\n\nThe property's history reflects the region's cultural heritage, from its indigenous inhabitants to its late 1800s settlers who used the land for cattle ranching and wood harvesting. Originally established through a homestead patent, the land likely supported grazing and timber production for many years. This case study examined real estate options and government programs available to small farmers interested in sustainable agriculture and wildlife conservation, using a local organic farm as a model.",
            "The relationship between brothers is defined by an eternal, unshakeable connection that encompasses various emotions including affection, honor, envy, and brutality. Siblings share a unique understanding that allows them to see themselves reflected in each other, particularly during challenging times when their true nature emerges. These emotional revelations often come at a significant price, as brothers must face the implications of their feelings and actions. When siblings truly see themselves in each other, they glimpse their authentic selves rather than their public persona.\n\nThis dynamic is powerfully illustrated in \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" where two brothers' relationship unfolds against a richly detailed backdrop. Their journey, though ultimately futile, culminates in a dramatic scene where pride and disappointment collide, resulting in tragedy. The story's themes are conveyed through the characterization of Doodle and his interactions with his brother, while the narrator's perspective reveals the complex emotional landscape that drives their actions.\n\nThe protagonist's behavior is fundamentally driven by pride. He harbors resentment toward his brother Doodle from their earliest interactions, having dreamed of a sibling who could match him in physical activities like swimming, running, and climbing. Doodle's severe heart condition makes these aspirations impossible, crushing the protagonist's expectations. The narrator's initial hostility toward Doodle is so severe that he even contemplates murder, though this dark impulse is dispelled by Doodle's innocent smile. This transformation reveals an underlying love beneath the surface, suggesting that his negative feelings weren't deeply rooted but rather stemmed from disappointed expectations.",
            "The human brain functions as a sophisticated information processor with remarkable complexity and inventiveness. Our understanding of it has evolved alongside technology, with historical comparisons ranging from wax tablets to modern computers, though it's important to note these analogies have their limitations.\n\nThe brain's information processing begins when sensory organs convert physical stimuli into electrochemical signals. These signals undergo dual processing: bottom-up processing assembles basic sensory data (like colors and edges) into recognizable objects, while top-down processing uses existing knowledge to enhance and speed up recognition. For instance, when viewing a black box against white space, both processes work together to help you correctly interpret what you're seeing.\n\nThe brain employs an attention filtering system to prioritize information processing. This system determines which signals deserve conscious awareness - for example, filtering out individual grass blades while walking but highlighting personally relevant information like hearing your name in a crowded space.\n\nInformation storage in the brain occurs through multiple memory systems: sensory, working, and long-term memory. Information undergoes encoding specific to its sensory type - verbal information, for example, can be encoded based on appearance, sound, or meaning. Working memory temporarily stores information through neural electrical circuits lasting about 20 seconds, while long-term memory appears to be preserved through protein structures.\n\nKnowledge organization in the brain has been explained through various models, drawing from human memory studies, computer science, and neurophysiology. One prominent model, the semantic network, suggests that information is organized as interconnected concept nodes. For example, mental concepts like \"chair\" connect to related concepts like \"table\" and \"wooden\" in an elaborate network of associations.",
            "The 2007 financial crisis in the United States caused widespread economic devastation, marked by rising unemployment, a housing market collapse, and the downfall of major corporations. This economic downturn's effects continue to resonate, prompting critical questions about its origins and prevention. The crisis emerged from misguided political decisions that encouraged banks to issue risky subprime loans within an inadequate financial system. The situation worsened when government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were compelled to convert these mortgages into complex financial instruments (CDOs and CDS'). When borrowers began defaulting, banks' insufficient capital reserves triggered a chain reaction that contaminated the broader economy.\n\nThe crisis's origins can be traced to 1999 during President Clinton's administration. Seeking re-election, Clinton's team loosened lending regulations, inadvertently setting the stage for the subsequent subprime crisis. A New York Times journalist, Steven Holmes, presciently warned about Fannie Mae's increased pressure to expand lending to lower-income borrowers while maintaining profit growth. Holmes accurately predicted that such practices could require government intervention during an economic downturn.\n\nThe crisis was amplified by innovative but risky mortgage products. The widespread use of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs created deep interconnections between the housing market and other economic sectors. This led to excessive leverage among U.S. households and financial markets, making them highly susceptible to price fluctuations.\n\nWhen housing prices eventually collapsed, financial institutions holding mortgage-backed securities suffered severe consequences. The five largest U.S. investment banks reported mortgage debts of $4.1 trillion in 2007, representing roughly 30% of the nation's GDP. This led to the fire sale of Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers' collapse, and forced Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to convert to commercial banks. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, carrying $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were ultimately placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "Exposition can be a tricky element in storytelling. While writers might feel tempted to showcase their literary prowess through lengthy explanations, this often leads to readers losing interest or becoming frustrated. Even experienced writers sometimes fall into the trap of including excessive information that doesn't serve the story.\n\nRemember: exposition isn't your ally in storytelling.\n\nWhile most writers are familiar with the golden rule \"Show, don't tell,\" it's easy to fall into the trap of writing lengthy passages where either nothing significant occurs or too much information is dumped at once. Writers often face two temptations: either rushing through background information to get to the exciting parts, or overwhelming readers with unnecessary details about characters' histories.\n\nExposition is essentially narrative explanation - telling rather than showing what happened. In movies, it often appears as information-heavy dialogue between characters, while in written fiction, it's the author directly explaining things to readers.\n\nConsider this scenario: imagine reading about a heroine's life where her meeting, marriage, and her husband's tragic murder are condensed into two pages with minimal dialogue. This approach fails to engage readers emotionally. Instead, the story should demonstrate the husband's character through his actions and words, showing how he enriched the heroine's life. This deeper characterization helps readers form an emotional connection and better understand both characters, making the tragedy more impactful.\n\nThe key is to flesh out the basic plot points with meaningful details and character development.\n\nWriters must resist the urge to rapidly list character traits and backstory (like someone's military service, current job, marital status, hobbies, and breakfast preferences) without proper development. Such information dumps often disconnect readers from the story rather than drawing them in.",
            "I analyzed two news broadcasts from NBC 4 in Columbus, Ohio on August 13, 2011. The primary story covered a domestic violence incident in Ashley, Ohio, where Shad Hostettler allegedly stabbed his wife multiple times. The brief two-minute coverage seemed appropriate given the developing nature of the story.\n\nThe broadcast then covered the critical shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area, with SWAT Team involvement and no immediate suspects. I noticed the coverage was notably brief, which appeared to reflect a concerning pattern of minimal media attention when victims are minorities, contrasting with the extensive coverage typically given to white victims.\n\nFollowing this was a report about a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter, identified as caused by a .22 caliber rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.\n\nThe weather segment briefly discussed predicted rain and thunderstorms, with weekend temperatures expected in the mid to low eighties. This seemed intentionally short to maintain viewer interest.\n\nThe coverage included a UDF store robbery on Clime Road in Columbus, where I noticed disproportionate emphasis on the suspect's race and skin tone in the description. The final story detailed the conviction of Texas Drug-Kingpin Rene Rodriguez for marijuana distribution to Ohio. Interestingly, they expressed his 25-year sentence as \"300 months\" and unnecessarily highlighted his ethnicity.",
            "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are investment vehicles that track specific market segments while offering stock-like trading flexibility. They combine the diversification benefits of index funds with stock trading features, including short selling, margin buying, and single-share purchasing options. While ETFs charge lower fees compared to typical mutual funds, investors must pay trading commissions similar to stocks. The market offers a diverse range of ETF options, though prudent investors should carefully verify claimed benefits such as diversification.\n\nThis analysis focuses on the ETF IHF, comparing it with its top 10 holdings to assess whether owning the ETF provides similar advantages to holding a diverse portfolio of its constituent stocks. We'll also explore if alternative configurations of these stocks might yield better performance metrics.\n\nFor practical purposes, our analysis concentrates on the top 10 holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. By normalizing these holdings to 100%, we can calculate how each stock contributes to the portfolio's Beta and Return, comparing these metrics to the complete ETF.\n\nThe analysis reveals that a portfolio containing just the top 10 holdings outperforms the ETF by 6.11% (a 16% return increase) while maintaining a Beta that's 0.12 lower than the full ETF. Though these results suggest superior performance from the top 10 holdings portfolio, further statistical analysis is needed to determine if the performance difference is statistically significant. This evaluation requires calculating and normalizing the standard deviation of each top 10 stock for comparison with the ETF IHF's overall standard deviation.",
            "Analysis of Figure 17 reveals a significant decline in commuter log submissions during the project's third month. This decline can be attributed to several factors. The winter season in New England naturally reduces bicycle and pedestrian commuting. The timing coincides with the fall semester's end, when the academic community is overwhelmed with final assignments and grading. The holiday season and subsequent academic break also contribute to reduced campus attendance. While these factors explain the December and January dips, the February decline remains somewhat puzzling. It's possible that this reflects a natural waning of enthusiasm following the initial project launch. To counter this downward trend, we implemented a Carpool Challenge Week in March, which successfully boosted participation.\n\nA key challenge was maintaining momentum despite both natural engagement decline and academic calendar disruptions. Additionally, we faced the deeply ingrained American cultural preference for personal vehicle use, which emphasizes convenience and independence. To encourage alternative transportation, we distributed incentives such as gift certificates to local businesses. In retrospect, offering increasingly valuable prizes throughout the project timeline - perhaps escalating from gift cards to major items like bicycles or even eco-friendly vehicles - might have been more effective in sustaining participation. While our initial incentives proved adequate, introducing progressively more substantial rewards could have prevented the observed participation decline and potentially increased engagement during traditionally low-participation periods.",
            "While examining the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I analyzed fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These productions utilized innovative editing techniques to create magical effects. My research primarily concentrated on analyzing the common characteristics of these trick films while noting some unique features that emerged in later examples. The typical trick film of this era was characterized by several conventions: it was filmed on a set, used a front-facing theatrical view, maintained a static camera position, employed long to medium camera distances, and consisted of what appeared to be a single continuous shot.\n\nThese films consistently shared the theatrical staging approach, filming indoor scenes from a fixed front view similar to a stage performance. The camera remained stationary rather than tracking the action or subjects. This style, deeply influenced by theater and magic show presentations, resulted in predominantly lateral movement of performers, who rarely approached or retreated from the camera. This is exemplified in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where actors move horizontally across the frame while the camera maintains its position.\n\nThe theatrical composition naturally led to the predominant use of long shots and occasional medium shots, completely avoiding close-ups. This mirrored the theatrical experience where audiences viewed the entire stage continuously. The middle-ground positioning of actors, who seldom moved toward the camera, eliminated any opportunity for close-up shots.\n\nMost of these early trick films appeared to consist of a single shot, typically running under a minute. This format limited their storytelling potential, resulting in brief vaudeville-style performances featuring magic tricks, disappearances, and transformations rather than complex narratives. However, what appeared as one continuous shot to viewers often comprised multiple shots cleverly edited together to create illusions. \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) demonstrates this technique, where careful observation reveals the subtle transition point where the shot of the \"severed head\" is incorporated, though it appears seamless to casual viewers.",
            "The Gothic Novel presents an inherent contradiction, combining \"old\" and \"new\" elements as noted by Ian Watt. This literary form has faced mixed reception, with critics both dismissing it as shallow and celebrating its ability to evoke the sublime, as Burke observed. Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, considered the first Gothic novel, merged classical romantic elements with modern storytelling techniques to establish the genre's foundation. Walpole blended traditional theatrical components with contemporary narrative approaches to create what he called \"A Gothic Story.\"\n\nThe genre heavily draws from medieval theatrical traditions, architectural elements, and cultural customs. By Otranto's publication, the term \"gothic\" had acquired multiple meanings across various contexts and was often viewed as primitive compared to modern developments in society and literature. The genre's enduring appeal stems from its unique fusion of theatrical Gothic elements with the novel's capacity for psychological insight, making it simultaneously timeless and contemporary for readers across different eras.\n\nChivalry emerges as a central Gothic theme, particularly in The Castle of Otranto. The medieval chivalric code, which outlined knightly conduct, is both preserved and transformed in the novel. Gothic authors, especially Walpole, emphasized chivalry to highlight the perceived decline of noble ideals in their contemporary society. This idealization of the medieval past, which foreshadowed the Romantic movement, served as a critique of present conditions. Walpole, writing during political turmoil, appeared to long for the moral certainty of the gothic era, believing it absent in his time. This perspective is evident in his characterization of Frederic, who embodies traditional chivalric virtues but is portrayed with typical Gothic excess, as seen in his depiction as a noble prince who has endured hardship and is believed to have died fighting infidels.",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the entire process of moving products from initial customer orders through raw materials, production, and final distribution. This term was first introduced by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982 to describe the comprehensive process of planning, implementing, and controlling supply chain operations to meet customer needs efficiently. The framework consists of six crucial components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information, which business managers utilize to optimize customer service.\n\nProduction, the initial phase, serves as the cornerstone of the supply chain process. During this stage, managers must determine the what, when, where, and how of production. They analyze market trends to understand customer demands, which guides decisions about product types and quantities. Once these factors are established, managers select appropriate production facilities based on volume capabilities and quality requirements, while ensuring customer satisfaction remains paramount. The production phase also involves careful planning of workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. The importance of meticulous planning in this phase cannot be overstated, as demonstrated by major retailers like Walmart and Target, which maintain detailed protocols for every aspect of their operations, from employee dress codes to shipment handling.\n\nSupply, the second key element, involves making strategic decisions about facility capabilities and potential outsourcing partnerships. Companies often operate multiple production divisions for a single product, each with its own equipment, workforce, and specialized capabilities. Managers must determine the most suitable division for each production process and may opt for outsourcing to achieve velocity – the ability to maintain quality and flexibility while optimizing costs.",
            "The Victorian era's literary landscape was dominated by novels known for their meticulous detail and aristocratic focus. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights stand apart from this convention. These works incorporate mysterious elements and unusual narratives that deviate from typical Victorian literature, which serves to enhance character development and provide deeper insights into their psychological states and motivations.\n\nThe novels frequently employ dream sequences and hallucinatory states as literary devices, though each work uses them differently. In Oliver Twist, these supernatural moments often illuminate Oliver's inner consciousness, revealing his emotional struggles and his growing understanding of his circumstances. Chapter 28's depiction of Oliver's shooting demonstrates this technique effectively. In the scene, Oliver experiences a dreamlike state where he relives the shooting, interacting with hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The passage emphasizes Oliver's powerlessness and deteriorating physical condition through his sensory confusion and persistent pain.\n\nThe scene's portrayal of Oliver's overwhelming helplessness raises questions about agency and fate. His inability to respond actively to life-threatening danger suggests both his fundamental powerlessness and the possibility that Fagin's influence has begun to erode his will to resist. The passage's description of time's distortion - with day barely existing and night becoming paradoxically both endless and brief - further reinforces the character's psychological distress and loss of control.",
            "While working as a tutor in an after-school program, I encountered a young Latino student named Adrian who struggled with reading. Despite speaking flawless English, he had unusual difficulties with certain letters. The mystery was solved when I met his Spanish-speaking mother - Adrian's reading challenges stemmed from unfamiliarity with the English alphabet rather than comprehension issues.\n\nThis experience highlights the complexities of language barriers in education, particularly in California. Even students who speak English fluently may face unexpected challenges with reading. While Adrian's situation required focused tutoring on English alphabet and pronunciation, many students with limited English proficiency need more comprehensive solutions. No single approach - whether dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, or ESL classes - can solve this issue alone. Success requires implementing multiple strategies simultaneously.\n\nThe dual language system, in particular, shows promise for all students, not just Spanish speakers. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs perform better academically than their peers. While some worry this approach wastes resources or only benefits a minority, making bilingual education standard practice would advantage everyone. Rather than requiring all teachers to be bilingual (which would be impractical), schools could employ bilingual specialists and tutors to support this approach.",
            "Most of us grow up learning about a higher power - something beyond our mortal understanding. Whether through religious institutions or personal exploration, we seek spiritual meaning. While some embrace their inherited faith, others reject it entirely, convinced that nothing exists beyond their own reality. Our spiritual journey often involves trying different belief systems as we attempt to find our place in the universe and seek guidance through life's darkness.\n\nI remember a conversation with my father on our porch during a rainstorm, sharing cigarettes as water cascaded from the gutters. When I asked about his favorite bird, he mentioned the cardinal, his gaze distant and contemplative. His illness had taken its toll - his clothes hung loose, his hair thinning. Words about his impending departure remained unspoken between us, too painful to acknowledge. Instead, we sat closer together, watching the rain fall in the growing darkness.\n\nThat December, shortly after I turned twenty-two, my father died. The aggressive treatments had only prolonged his suffering beyond the doctors' estimates, leaving me questioning the purpose of such extended pain. My faith wavered; I stopped praying, feeling abandoned by a God I no longer understood.\n\nI chose not to witness his final moments, wanting to preserve memories of his life rather than his death. Understanding him as only a child could, I knew he wouldn't want me to watch his passing. I isolated myself for three days, waiting for news of his death. The news never came through a phone call - I was left to face this profound loss in solitude.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline, though primarily a farmer, emerged as a passionate advocate for Republicanism, with his agricultural background deeply influencing his views on government, personal liberty, and civic matters. His farming perspective shaped his positions on sovereignty, constitutional interpretation, and judicial matters.\n\nTaylor saw America's unique position as advantageous, believing the absence of established traditions allowed for creating an authentic system of self-governance. He championed the interconnected nature of natural rights, arguing that compromising one right would inevitably weaken all others, thus placing them beyond governmental control. He criticized the notion that society should mirror nature's law of might-makes-right.\n\nIn Taylor's vision of an ideal society, government needed to address humanity's moral duality. He maintained that governmental systems reflect human virtues and flaws alike. His definition of positive principles centered on protecting private property, advancing agriculture, and resisting capitalism. Taylor believed that self-interest, while fundamental to human nature, became problematic only when it prioritized special interests over public welfare. He advocated for governmental oversight to check humanity's negative tendencies while remaining vigilant against corrupt principles.\n\nAs a committed Republican, Taylor advocated for strict constitutional interpretation and minimal federal authority, limiting government powers to those explicitly stated in the Constitution. He warned against an expansive federal system, seeing it as potentially tyrannical due to its cost. However, he cautioned against overly literal constitutional interpretation, emphasizing the importance of considering the founders' intent. Notably, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as the nation's true founding document, as it better reflected his view of America as a union of sovereign states rather than a single unified nation.",
            "I gazed downward, observing the scene before me with detached neutrality. My mind processed what I saw mechanically, refusing to form emotional connections. Thoughts flowed through my consciousness like water, creating an almost pure sensory experience rather than coherent reflection.\n\nI once bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" on a fellow artist's recommendation, hoping to fulfill my childhood dream of learning to draw. The book taught everything from basic tool handling to complex mental processes. One key technique involved using a frame to simplify complex scenes - turning an intricate kitchen scene into a manageable still life of a fruit bowl.\n\nIn this moment, however, I couldn't apply such artistic framing. I was too captivated by what lay before me. While great artists had their signature colors - Picasso's blue period, Monet's greens, the Renaissance masters' vibrant palettes - here was the beginning of my own artistic statement: a study in brown.\n\nMy fingers grasped my tool as I prepared for what could have been my masterpiece. The water moved gracefully, clear and pristine. Particles separated and disappeared into the current. With increasing urgency, I hit the toilet handle again, but the stubborn brown mass remained fixed to the bowl's bottom, unmoved.\n\nThere I stood in my Rite Aid uniform, green tie choking my neck, mop in hand, contemplating this unwanted \"gift\" left by some inconsiderate customer. After several unsuccessful flushes and moments of philosophical reflection, I reached for toilet paper, wrapping my hand thoroughly until it resembled protective wear. Then, like reaching for a roasting turkey, I reluctantly lowered my hand toward the bowl...",
            "Young drivers face a significant mortality risk on the roads. Multiple elements contribute to this dangerous situation affecting America's youngest motorists. Research from the National Institutes of Health indicates that adolescents' cognitive development hasn't reached the level necessary for safe driving. Lack of experience is another crucial factor, leading to higher instances of fatal crashes, vehicle flips, excessive speed, and road departures.\n\nThe presence of peer passengers significantly increases risk factors - a common scenario among teen drivers. Research conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center demonstrates a clear link between passenger age and accident frequency.\n\nWhile states like California have implemented provisional licensing systems limiting driving hours and passenger numbers for teens, these measures may be insufficient. Statistics consistently show that young drivers struggle to manage driving risks and responsibilities effectively. Research by psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, as reported in USA Today, indicates that even 18-year-olds may be too young to drive safely, citing their natural inclination toward thrill-seeking behavior. This tendency suggests that delaying driving privileges until this risk-taking propensity diminishes could be beneficial. The situation becomes more pressing considering the impending surge of new teen drivers as Baby Boomers' children reach driving age.\n\nA potential solution could involve nationwide legislation establishing 18 as the minimum driving age. This framework would maintain driver's education in schools while implementing a graduated licensing system with mandatory training hours, similar to existing state requirements like California's model of 6 hours of professional instruction and 50 hours of supervised practice. Given that teen driving statistics show similar patterns across states, implementing uniform national standards could effectively address this safety concern.\n\nThis proposed legislative approach builds upon existing concepts rather than introducing entirely new ideas.",
            "This research examines Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) across three key aspects. It begins with a definition, followed by diagnostic procedures and identifiable traits, and concludes with classroom accommodation strategies for teachers working with CAPD students in mainstream settings.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), involves the brain's ability to process auditory information effectively. While individuals with CAPD have normal hearing capabilities, their brains struggle to properly interpret and process auditory inputs, such as distinguishing between different sounds or filtering out background noise.\n\nThe disorder was first identified in the 1950s under the term \"auditory imperception.\" Italian scientists Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari pioneered testing methods in 1954, followed by Kimura's breakthrough in dichotic testing in 1961. A significant 1977 national conference sparked increased research interest in pediatric CAPD.\n\nCAPD symptoms are diverse, including difficulties with: sound localization, distinguishing between different sounds, recognizing sound patterns, detecting vocal nuances (like sarcasm), processing sequential sounds, synthesizing audio information meaningfully, and processing sounds in the correct order.\n\nDiagnosis requires comprehensive evaluation through various methods, including behavioral observations and auditory function assessments. Multiple professionals, such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists, may be involved in the diagnostic process. Currently, there is no single standardized diagnostic tool, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Diagnostic procedures often involve tests with multiple simultaneous audio stimuli, requiring patients to differentiate specific elements, and may include sophisticated acoustic response measurements.",
            "My goal in pursuing social work education is to build a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on supporting troubled families and protecting abused or neglected children. I bring essential qualities to the social work profession, including dedication to service, respectful behavior, ethical conduct, and a commitment to fostering better relationships while maintaining professional growth. These principles aren't merely professional requirements – they reflect my personal values.\n\nMy journey to social work wasn't straightforward. During my academic years, I observed many peers avoiding their problems or adopting unhealthy coping mechanisms, which led me to earn a Psychology degree from Piedmont College in 2009. A pivotal moment occurred that summer when I met a teenage boy seeking refuge from abusive parents at a friend's house. After he reported his parents to the police, I visited their home to help. When speaking with the officers and parents, I noticed the parents' defensive behavior as they dismissed serious family conflicts as \"simple disputes.\" This experience crystallized my decision to pursue social work, specifically to advocate for children in troubled family situations.\n\nSocial justice is another cornerstone of my professional and personal philosophy. I've always questioned society's paradoxical approach to individuality – claiming to value it while simultaneously promoting conformity. Throughout my academic years, I actively challenged social injustice through various forms of self-expression: sporting unconventional hair colors, embracing unique fashion choices, getting multiple piercings, openly supporting LGBTQ+ rights through GSBA involvement, and consistently opposing racism and discrimination. My commitment to social justice remains unwavering, and I continue to stand against societal inequities.",
            "This paper examines insomnia through the lens of both Biological and Sociocultural models. While the biological perspective examines inherited genetic factors and medical conditions, the sociocultural approach investigates how environmental factors, including race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status, influence the condition. The paper analyzes various research studies related to these models and evaluates their strengths and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified into three main categories: primary sleep disorders, those connected to other mental disorders, and those linked to various other causes. Primary sleep disorders are further divided into Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while mental disorder-related sleep issues are connected to Axis I or Axis II conditions. Medical conditions or substance use can cause other sleep disorders. Dyssomnias include several conditions, notably Primary Insomnia (difficulty sleeping) and Primary Hypersomnia (difficulty staying awake), both requiring a month-long duration for diagnosis. Other conditions include Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia NOS. Parasomnias, which involve abnormal behaviors or physiological events during sleep, include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias NOS.\n\nThe biological model emphasizes the role of genetics and physiology in sleep disorders. Research has shown that orexin-containing neurons in the hypothalamus control sleep-wake cycles, with GABAB receptors playing a crucial role. Studies on mice demonstrated that GABAA receptor activation promotes sleep, while GABAB agonists increase sleep duration. These findings suggest potential genetic and environmental influences on human sleep patterns, with receptor dysfunction potentially requiring medical intervention. Such biological factors can significantly impact an individual's daily functioning, affecting their academic, professional, and personal lives.",
            "As a student who has spent over two years at University Park, I've experienced firsthand the challenges of campus navigation. My experience began in East Halls, situated at the campus's eastern edge, where a simple journey to central locations like Willard building could consume nearly half an hour on foot, particularly during State College's frequently adverse weather conditions. The campus has undergone significant transformation - what was once vacant land surrounding East Halls has been developed into athletic fields, modern facilities like the new Creamery and health services building, and residential complexes. This expansion has made campus navigation increasingly challenging.\n\nThe optimal solution to this mobility challenge is cycling, though its effectiveness depends on both student participation and appropriate infrastructure. This perspective was reinforced by a conversation with a friend who had recently returned to cycling, acknowledging its practicality and efficiency. Bicycling not only promotes physical health but also represents the most energy-efficient mode of transportation - a simple breakfast can fuel a 30-mile journey.\n\nLiving off-campus now, at a distance comparable to some dorms, I've found that purchasing a bicycle was an extremely wise choice. It has transformed what would be a 25-minute walk to Thomas building into a mere 5-minute ride. While Pollock Road offers the most direct route, it presents its own challenges for cyclists. Though walking remains an option, it's impractical for my schedule. Without a bicycle, I would spend an additional 2.5 hours weekly just walking to and from Thomas building alone, not counting other campus destinations. This significant time investment makes cycling not just convenient, but necessary for managing my busy schedule efficiently.",
            "In Brave New World, Aldous Huxley presents a critique of advancing technology and capitalism through a dystopian society where communal values supersede individual identity, and instant gratification is the primary goal. The World Controller manipulates the population, who are essentially trapped within a prescribed way of thinking. Through a Marxist interpretation, the novel reveals Huxley's skepticism toward these developing systems, employing concepts like homogeneity and reification to comment on contemporary economic trends.\n\nThe novel illustrates the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where the masses are kept ignorant of true class relationships due to their focus on personal gain. This is demonstrated through the conditioning of lower castes (Delta, Gamma, etc.), who are programmed through hypnopædia to perpetually consume and indulge. The concept of hegemony is evident as the ruling class maintains complete control over subordinate classes, who unknowingly support the capitalistic structure. While upper classes (Alphas and Betas) have the potential for awareness, most, except for few individuals like Bernard, accept their predetermined roles without question.\n\nThe novel portrays a world devoid of meaningful personal connections, with characters lacking psychological depth – possibly suggesting that the combination of technology and capitalism strips humanity of its essence. Genuine emotions, including love, are absent, replaced by superficial interactions characterized by physical observations and casual sexual encounters. The various social classes' acceptance of their positions reflects capitalism's socioeconomic impact, with each group conditioned to believe in their purpose while continuing to consume and conform, exemplifying the Marxist view of how the proletariat is manipulated through false consciousness.",
            "Reflecting on a college course about Islam I took nearly four years ago, I remember how we debated whether Islam was inherently hostile - a question that remains particularly relevant today. The media's portrayal of Islam has notably shifted from post-9/11 hostility to what seems like excessive accommodation, exemplified by the historic presidency bid of Barack Obama, despite his family's Muslim connections.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography presents an interesting contradiction to my previous understanding of his character. While historical accounts I'm familiar with portrayed him as someone who forcibly converted conquered peoples to Islam, the biography depicts him as a misunderstood, humble figure whose teachings naturally attracted followers.\n\nI noticed striking parallels between Jesus's ministry and Muhammad's reported miracles, such as the story of multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men. This narrative approach seems designed to present Muhammad as a modest prophet who performed miracles matter-of-factly. However, this appears to diminish Jesus's unique miracles and ministry by creating similar stories around Muhammad.\n\nThe biography frequently relies on chain-narrative testimonials about conversions to Islam, where stories are passed down through multiple sources. Rather than strengthening the authenticity of these accounts, this method of storytelling actually makes them seem less credible.\n\nMost concerning is the biography's portrayal of Muhammad as a humble, wise, and gentle religious leader, which appears to conflict with historical records of his rise to power. This raises questions about whether contemporary Muslims are aware of the historical context of Muhammad's ascension to leadership.",
            "Christianity rapidly diverged from Jesus's original teachings after his death, with successive generations moving increasingly away from its initial form. Today, despite resistance from traditionalists, there's a growing progressive consciousness that may lead to significant changes in Christian thought. In the coming years, Christians are likely to develop a stronger interest in distinguishing between original teachings and later additions to their faith. This will eventually trigger a massive reversal in Christian history, with believers gradually stripping away accumulated doctrines to rediscover Jesus's original message.\n\nThis movement will likely spread throughout Western nations, prompting people to worship in ways that mirror early Christianity. While churches will maintain their institutional importance, the current diversity in Christian denominations will gradually give way to greater uniformity in beliefs and practices. This pattern of dramatic historical reversals isn't unprecedented – consider how the Roman Empire shifted from persecuting Christians to embracing Christianity, or how America evolved from slavery to having African-American leaders.\n\nThis religious transformation will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus's teachings metaphorically rather than literally. To understand this evolution, we must look back to Christianity's roots in Judaism. Before the Roman occupation of Jerusalem in 63 BCE, Judaism had already established its core principles of monotheism, divine revelation, and biblical authority. The Jewish community was diverse, split between various groups including Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general population.",
            "Through the lens of The Jungle, we can observe humanity's inherent selfishness and greed. The novel illustrates how people prioritize their own advancement while disregarding those beneath them in social status. This theme is particularly evident in the portrayal of factory owners and managers, who relentlessly pursue corporate growth and profits with complete disregard for collateral damage.\n\nSinclair vividly depicts this through imagery of industrial devastation, describing factories with \"great chimneys\" spewing endless streams of smoke into the sky. This portrayal emphasizes the owners' indifference to environmental damage and public health, as they ignore the consequences of industrial pollution and unsanitary conditions in Packingtown's animal pens.\n\nThe exploitation extends deeply into labor practices. The workplace is described as a \"seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds\" where profit consistently trumps human dignity. Workers face arbitrary layoffs, dangerous working conditions, and exhausting schedules, with no job security or protective regulations. The absence of labor laws during this period allowed management to prioritize productivity over worker safety and wellbeing.\n\nThe situation in Packingtown created a system of de facto slavery, particularly affecting poor immigrants. Workers were trapped in a cycle of poverty and exploitation, with no meaningful support systems or legitimate organizations to defend their rights. While labor unions existed, they often exploited rather than helped workers. The novel draws a direct parallel between these industrial workers and chattel slavery, noting that under such desperate conditions, where survival depends on the whims of ruthless employers, moral degradation becomes inevitable.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-land\" among his finest poetic works. The poem features the word \"Thulé\" twice, which has historical roots in Virgil's writings about a mysterious northern island beyond Britain that marked the boundary of the ancient Greek world. While Virgil's influence is undeniable, there's a more contemporary source worth noting, given Poe's known appreciation of German literature.\n\nThis connection is particularly significant as it demonstrates Poe's knowledge of Goethe's work. Scholar Karl J. Arndt has noted the similarities between their poetry, suggesting Poe drew inspiration from Goethe.\n\nGoethe, as noted in the Oxford Companion to English Literature, was renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two segments (1808 and 1832). Within \"Faust Part Two\" lies \"The King of Thulé,\" a poignant tale about a grieving king who, after receiving a goblet from his dying wife, succumbs to drinking and eventually chooses death, throwing the cherished goblet into the ocean. The parallels between this king and the narrator in \"Dream-Land\" suggest a possible reflection of Poe's own struggles with loss and alcohol.\n\nPoe uses \"Thule\" in both \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land,\" with the latter featuring it prominently as bookends. Reading \"Dream-Land\" alongside \"The King of Thulé\" reveals striking thematic similarities: both works explore themes of darkness, loneliness, and haunting memories. The speaker in \"Dream-Land\" seems to inhabit the same melancholic world as Goethe's king.\n\nPoe's familiarity with Goethe would have been natural, not only through the German author's various contemporary adaptations but also through Poe's admiration of Tennyson, who was known to appreciate Goethe's work.",
            "This case examines whether punitive damages could be awarded in California for a slip-and-fall incident at D&D Markets. The incident occurred when Jennifer Palmer fell on an unremedied applesauce spill, resulting in serious back injuries. The store manager, Paul Martin, had been notified twice about the spill but ignored it for 30 minutes while on his dinner break.\n\nThe legal analysis suggests Palmer's punitive damage claim would likely survive summary dismissal. Under California Civil Code § 3294(a), punitive damages can be awarded if a defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Malice is defined as either intentional harm or \"despicable\" conduct showing willful disregard for others' safety. The precedent set in Taylor v. Superior Court establishes that malicious conduct includes cases where defendants are aware of probable dangers but deliberately fail to address them.\n\nPalmer's case is strengthened by several factors: The manager was notified twice about the hazard, six similar accidents had occurred at the store in 2009, and Martin deliberately ignored the situation despite knowing the risks. While proving the conduct was \"despicable\" might be challenging, Palmer can make a reasonable argument that Martin's conscious disregard for customer safety, especially given the store's history of accidents, meets the legal threshold for punitive damages under California law.",
            "There was an emptiness within her that persisted, starting at age 14 and continuing through her seventeenth year. As time passed, she realized it wasn't a thing she yearned for, but rather a person. Curiously, despite receiving attention from various boys, none sparked her interest. This peculiarity led to considerable self-reflection, though she never reached any satisfactory conclusions about her romantic indifference. She simply continued living while pondering these feelings.\n\nHer home life was typically serene, with parents who rarely quarreled, either with each other or with her. The only occasional tensions arose from her strong-willed, independent nature. While her parents embodied tranquility, she possessed a vibrant, outgoing personality that, combined with her kindness, made her well-liked by others.\n\nHowever, this particular day shattered their usual peace when her mother's scream echoed from the kitchen. Rushing to investigate, she found her mother sprawled on the floor, clearly in agony. Between labored breaths, her mother requested to be taken to the hospital. Thanks to her strength training, she managed to carry her mother to the car and place her in the backseat.\n\nAt the hospital, despite the typical clinical atmosphere heavy with anxiety and antiseptic, she remained focused solely on her mother's wellbeing. She rushed in carrying her mother, calling urgently for medical assistance. Healthcare workers quickly transferred her mother to a gurney and whisked her away for examination, leaving the daughter to wait anxiously.\n\nThe incident, it turned out, had occurred when her mother fell while trying to retrieve a vase from the topmost cabinet using a stepstool.",
            "The research aimed to demonstrate that following a Mediterranean Diet (Med diet), measured by the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" helps reduce the likelihood of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and related deaths. The aMed diet, a variation of the traditional Mediterranean diet, emphasizes consuming more plant-based foods (fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, but not potatoes), fish, and monounsaturated fats while limiting animal products and saturated fats. It also permits moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious research has shown that following a Mediterranean diet is linked to lower overall and cardiovascular mortality rates. Additionally, a clinical trial demonstrated that the Med diet was superior to low-fat diets in achieving weight loss and improving cholesterol ratios in obese people. However, these earlier studies didn't specifically examine stroke outcomes.\n\nThe investigation tracked 74,886 female nurses aged 38-63 years, who had no previous cardiovascular disease or diabetes, as part of the larger Nurses' Health Study involving 121,700 women across 11 US states. Between 1984 and 2004, researchers calculated aMed diet scores six times using validated food frequency questionnaires (FFQs). The study maintained over 95% participation throughout its 20-year duration. Cases of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical records, autopsies, or death certificates, with some cases (17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal heart attacks) classified as \"probable\" when records were unavailable.\n\nTo better represent long-term dietary patterns, researchers used cumulative averages of aMed scores from repeated FFQs. They controlled for potential confounding factors including age, smoking, body mass index, hormonal factors, supplement use, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, they analyzed the relationship between aMed scores and cardiovascular outcomes. The results showed that women with higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet had significantly lower risks of both CHD and stroke. Over the 20-year study period, they documented 2,391 CHD cases, 1,763 stroke cases, and 1,077 cardiovascular deaths. Women in the highest aMed score category showed a 29% lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest category.",
            "A photo captures actress Ellen Page (now known as Elliot Page) holding a cardboard sign with an unsettling message linking Hitler to Burma. Burma (Myanmar), a Southeast Asian nation, has been under military control since a 1962 coup. In 2007, the country witnessed its first major protests in ten years, dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution\" due to the Buddhist monks' distinctive robes who led the demonstrations. While initially peaceful, these protests escalated into violent confrontations between monks and the military regime, which began raiding monasteries nationwide. Foreign media faced severe persecution, exemplified by the killing of Japanese photographer Kenji Nagai. Though official records cite 13 deaths, defected Colonel Hla Win suggested thousands were actually killed.\n\nThis pattern of governmental oppression isn't unique to modern times. Throughout history, rulers have sought absolute control over their populations. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, Japanese emperors were considered deities, and modern political leaders often align themselves with influential religious figures to maintain power.\n\nSimilar instances of authoritarian violence include the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in China, where casualty figures vary dramatically between government reports (200-300) and Red Cross estimates (2,000-3,000). The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s saw government-backed Hutu militias systematically eliminating Tutsis and political moderates. The Holocaust under Hitler's Third Reich, targeting Jews across multiple countries, stands as another devastating example of state-sponsored violence.",
            "Duke Ellington's influence on jazz is primarily attributed to his enduring career and exceptional ability to mold his orchestra's sound. While his piano work may be understated in many compositions, his genius as a composer shone through in creating intricate pieces that capitalized on his musicians' individual talents. He expertly designed musical frameworks that balanced structured orchestration with room for improvisation, tailoring parts to highlight each band member's unique style. This approach resulted in distinctive orchestral sounds that perfectly suited each composition. His deep understanding of both individual musicians and ensemble dynamics enabled him to create some of jazz's most groundbreaking works.\n\nCreole Love Call, as noted in the Grove Music dictionary, exemplifies Ellington's innovative use of vocals as a pure instrumental element, free from lyrics. This twelve-bar blues composition, structured in six choruses, demonstrates his skill in complementing soloists:\n\nThe first chorus features an interplay between voice and reeds, evolving from smooth to rougher tones.\nThe second showcases a muted trumpet solo expanding on the main melody.\nThe third presents a high-register clarinet solo with subtle piano accompaniment.\nThe fourth involves the full band recreating the opening chorus's call-and-response pattern.\nThe fifth reaches its peak with high-register reeds leading the call-and-response.\nThe sixth revisits the opening structure but incorporates vocal \"growl\" technique.\nThe piece concludes with a brief tag combining a vocal run and dissonant trombone ending.\n\nThis innovative vocal approach became a hallmark of Ellington's style, as evidenced in later works like Hot and Bothered, where he masterfully blended Bubber Miley's muted trumpet with Baby Cox's scat singing. This technique evolved further in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone introduces the melody, showcasing Ellington's continued exploration of unique instrumental voices.",
            "What factors determine evolutionary patterns in organisms, and what limitations might shape evolutionary trajectories? Despite D'Arcy Thompson's 1917 observation about the lack of mathematical descriptions for biological forms - an observation that remains relevant today - progress has been made in applying mathematical models to understand mollusk shell development, both in individual growth and evolutionary history.\n\nOur research investigates how mathematical modeling of developmental and evolutionary changes in Prunum, combined with experimental work, can reveal mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental modifications. We analyzed X-ray images of Prunum species to identify measurable characteristics that could be used to model both theoretical and actual shell shapes using the CerioShell software. By modeling potential shell forms, we explored the boundaries of possible morphological variations in Prunum, integrating these findings with experimental and observational studies to better comprehend major evolutionary changes in this group.\n\nA mollusk shell can be conceptualized as a tube that rotates through space, creating 360-degree turns called whorls around a central axis (the columella). The growth rate of these whorls can vary, with suture lines marking the boundaries between them. The final whorl, known as the body whorl, is typically the largest, while the spire encompasses all previous whorls. The shell structure extends from the apex (top) to the base, with the aperture serving as the opening for the animal.\n\nShells can be examined from multiple angles: apical (top), basal (bottom), apertural (front), and abapertural (back). The standard presentation shows the aperture facing the viewer with the apex pointing upward. Whorl counting begins from the initial suture line when viewed from above, with measurements made to the nearest quarter whorl.\n\nThe shell's development can be understood as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. This growth pattern can be tracked using coordinates of aperture centers and their dimensions, allowing for mathematical representation and manipulation of shell development parameters.",
            "Indonesia's progress in reducing infant and neonatal mortality has been minimal over the past decade. Despite achieving several Millennium Development Goals, particularly in water and sanitation, the country's improvements in maternal and child health fall significantly behind target expectations for 2015. This underperformance stems from various factors that suggest a need for comprehensive health system enhancement rather than isolated program interventions.\n\nWhile Indonesia has achieved 72% coverage of births attended by skilled health workers, this figure includes traditional practitioners like midwives who lack capabilities to handle medical complications, particularly hemorrhage cases. This statistic, therefore, presents an overly optimistic picture of progress. Furthermore, there's been a reduction in professional treatment of childhood diarrhea cases, and postnatal care remains inadequate nationwide.\n\nThe country's cesarean section rate of 4% is below expected levels, with a notable urban-rural disparity (7% vs. 2%). This highlights significant geographical inequities in healthcare access. Additionally, a 27% gap in healthcare utilization exists between the wealthiest and poorest population segments, suggesting financial barriers to access, primarily due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn addressing these maternal and neonatal care challenges, Indonesia faces a strategic choice between targeted programmatic interventions and broader health system strengthening. While vertical, program-specific approaches offer focused objectives and quick results, they have significant drawbacks. These include resource diversion from other health sectors (as seen in HIV/AIDS funding impact on family planning), staff concentration in well-funded areas, and service duplication across uncoordinated programs, leading to increased administrative burden.",
            "Over the last century, Popular Music has evolved into such a vast array of genres that creating an exhaustive list has become challenging. Each major genre - including rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk - has developed numerous subdivisions and further subcategories. Heavy Metal rock, in particular, has emerged as one of popular music's most varied and emotionally rich genres in the past four decades. While often exploring darker themes, it demonstrates remarkable emotional range and adaptability. This flexibility has led to continuous branching into new sub-genres, creating an ongoing evolution that continues today.\n\nThe heavy metal landscape has become so diverse that defining its core characteristics has grown increasingly complex. While it has absorbed influences from various musical styles, understanding its origins is crucial. To comprehend contemporary metal music's widespread presence, one must grasp both its nature as a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal distinguishes itself as a movement characterized by intensity and darkness. It can be described as music of excess - featuring amplified bass, increased volume, heightened aggression, and theatrical elements. Unlike primitive music forms, metal demands technical proficiency, with musicians demonstrating exceptional instrumental skills. The movement was significantly influenced by the psychedelic drug culture of the mid-1970s, which led to experimental, otherworldly recordings. Metal introduced unprecedented dark, visceral qualities to popular music, which traditionally avoided such emotional territory. Modern metal also draws inspiration from the dark themes prevalent in the Romantic Era. This darkness is exemplified in various lyrics, including those from \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles, which some consider an early heavy metal song. The Beatles created this darker, heavier track to compete with the Rolling Stones' sound, including it on their White Album.",
            "Several decades prior to Surrealism's emergence, Henri Rousseau was already creating his own visionary artworks. His 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, carries dual significance - depicting both a woman's mystical dream experience and symbolizing Rousseau's personal artistic aspirations. Throughout his career, he yearned for artistic recognition while grappling with a fundamental choice: whether to adopt conventional painting styles for acceptance or maintain his distinctive creative voice.\n\nTo understand The Dream's significance, context about Rousseau's life is essential. Born in 1844 in Laval, France, to a moderately successful tinsmith, Rousseau lacked formal artistic training. Until age forty, he worked as a municipal toll collector, often mistakenly called a customs inspector. Personal tragedy marked his life, with his first wife Clémence's death following the loss of eight children, leaving him with just one daughter, Julia. Art became his solace and new beginning. Unlike his contemporaries who idealized peasant life in their works, Rousseau's perspective reflected his working-class background and aspirations.\n\nHis desire for artistic acceptance becomes more comprehensible given his circumstances: he began painting late in life without formal training, competing alongside established modern artists. Despite years of work, recognition came late, around the same time Matisse was gaining prominence. As Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters, their motivations differed fundamentally: while Matisse sought to avoid artistic conventionality, Rousseau desperately wanted to create conventional art that would earn him acceptance into the Artiste Français.",
            "Throughout history, philosophers have noted a profound relationship between moral principles and artistic beauty. This connection appears to stem from a deeper truth, as captured in Keats' famous lines from \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" about the unity of beauty and truth. Unlike conventional knowledge acquired through formal education or life experiences, our understanding of ethics and aesthetics seems to come from a more intuitive place. Both fields aim to describe rather than dictate, attempting to explain why we find certain actions moral or certain works beautiful, instead of providing strict guidelines.\n\nWhen analyzing art or moral behavior, we often find that conventional explanations fall short. Take the Mona Lisa, for instance - while we can discuss its technical aspects and historical significance, these elements alone don't fully explain its artistic merit. People often preface their appreciation of art with phrases like \"There's just something about it,\" suggesting an ineffable quality. This same phenomenon applies to moral understanding. As O'Connor suggests with storytelling, some truths can only be conveyed through indirect means, and both artistic and ethical appreciation possess elements that defy complete analytical description.\n\nThe connection between morality and art is particularly strong because both operate on a deeper, almost mystical level that we can experience but struggle to fully articulate - what Kant would call the noumenal realm. This relationship is especially evident in literature, which uniquely combines artistic expression with moral significance. As McKean points out, literature's distinctive feature is its moral dimension, making it particularly relevant to human experience since both living and literature inherently involve value judgments and ethical considerations.",
            "Modern Germany represents a unified nation with a distinctive cultural identity that spans from Munich near the Alps to Kiel by the Baltic Sea, and from Cologne along the Rhine to Dresden on the Elbe. This cohesive culture emerged from diverse tribal origins and multiple historical influences.\n\nThe ancestral homeland, Germania, has a name whose origins remain debated among academics. According to Tacitus, the name derived from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe that was known as Germans before their Rhine crossing and conflicts with the Gauls. The term \"Germanus\" was first documented by Julius Caesar in his Gallic Wars chronicles, borrowed from the Gauls to differentiate between conquered and unconquered peoples. Various theories suggest the name could mean \"neighbor\" in Gaulish, reference their \"ger\" spear, or stem from the Old Irish \"garim\" (to shout).\n\nTacitus's 98 AD work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" portrayed the Germans as indigenous people, largely unmixed with other groups. He argued that Germany's harsh climate and wild landscape made it an unlikely destination for voluntary migration from more hospitable regions like Asia, Africa, or Italy.\n\nEven the Romans maintained a limited presence in Germania, primarily engaging in trade and occasional military campaigns rather than permanent settlement. Germanic tribes, emerging in the mid-first century, established themselves along the Roman Empire's borders, trading goods and offering their military service to the Roman army while maintaining their independence.",
            "Shakespeare's Twelfth Night explores how disguise, while effective for temporary deception, ultimately demands resolution lest one's true identity becomes permanently obscured. The aftermath of revealing such deception often leads to social complications, forcing individuals to choose between maintaining their authentic selves or preserving their relationships. While some people might accept the revelation of deception gracefully, others may feel betrayed and respond with hostility.\n\nThe theme of gender-based deception raises particularly complex questions, primarily regarding motivation. In the case of Viola, her cross-dressing serves as a survival strategy in unfamiliar territory, as evidenced when she acknowledges the captain's help in preserving her safety through this disguise. However, this protective measure comes at a cost, isolating her from female companionship and creating unexpected romantic complications. Her convincing male persona leads to Olivia's misplaced affections and creates a complex dynamic with Orsino, who struggles with his feelings for someone he believes to be male.\n\nFor contemporary audiences, the play can be interpreted as an exploration of how deception can unveil hidden desires and emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. While one might question whether Olivia's attraction to Cesario suggests repressed same-sex desires, it's more likely that Shakespeare intended to satirize the superficiality of attraction based solely on appearances. This interpretation is supported by Olivia's quick transition of affections from Cesario to Sebastian, and her eventual acceptance of Viola as a sister rather than a romantic interest.",
            "The German colonial empire's legacy is complex, particularly regarding its educational policies across different territories. While infamous for acts of brutality, such as the Ovaherero and Nama genocide in German South West Africa, the empire's administrative approaches varied significantly by region. For instance, when British forces assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a considerable number of well-educated African inhabitants. Similar educational achievements were documented in Kamerun and other German colonies.\n\nHowever, German South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) developed quite differently. Unlike East Africa's government-led educational system, South West Africa delegated native education primarily to missionary organizations, offering them minimal state support. Conversely, the colonial government heavily invested in European settlers' education, creating state schools and providing substantial support to missionary institutions serving white colonists. This disparity resulted in lasting educational inequalities, with most of the native population remaining illiterate, unlike in other German colonies.\n\nThe academic literature on education in German colonies is extensive, with early 20th-century German sources focusing mainly on describing educational systems. Later English-language studies introduced comparative analyses and explored specific aspects of colonial education. Cohen's research, comparing South West Africa and East Africa, particularly emphasizes how the large settler population in South West Africa influenced its distinct educational approach.\n\nSouth West Africa's relatively moderate climate, despite its desert regions, attracted a significant European population. By 1913, it hosted nearly 15,000 white settlers, almost triple the European population in East Africa, the next most populated German colony. This demographic pattern significantly influenced the territory's social and educational policies.",
            "The United States and Mexico experienced a significant rivalry lasting 57 years (1836-1893), as noted by Diehl and Goerts (2000). This conflict reached its peak during the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), resulting in the US annexation of Texas and the Southwest. The antagonism, which persisted until just before WWI, was rooted in religious, cultural, and material differences between the two nations (Schmitt 1974).\n\nThis pattern is common among neighboring countries, where shared borders often lead to conflicting interests and rivalries. According to Pletcher (1977), Mexico and Cuba stand out as the only Latin American nations with sustained diplomatic tensions with the United States, while other countries in the region maintained positive relations.\n\nReligious differences played a crucial role in the conflict. Frahm (2001) notes that American opposition to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries paralleled their later resistance to fascism and communism. This religious-ideological divide, similar to the US-Soviet tensions during the Cold War, stemmed from inherited Anglo-Spanish antagonisms that complicated diplomatic relations between the two nations.\n\nDuring the 57-year rivalry period, Diehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 disputes, primarily involving territorial issues and border security problems. Both nations eventually had to deploy military forces to address cross-border bandit activity (Schmitt 1974).\n\nThe rivalry gradually diminished as Mexico became economically dependent on the United States, and American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic influence in Mexico during the late 19th century (Schmitt 1974).",
            "An unexpected illness left me disabled at age 46, completely transforming my life. As a nurse - a career I had chosen for its promised stability rather than pursuing my dreams of science or journalism - I found myself unable to work and financially vulnerable.\n\nAfter 15 years on disability benefits, I've lost nearly everything I once owned. Though I manage to survive, each day brings new challenges to my sense of security and self-worth. What's become crystal clear is that I couldn't have endured without the support of family and friends. When crisis hits, even the strongest among us need help.\n\nLife's emergencies, both major and minor, are inevitable. No matter how well-prepared we are, some challenges are simply too enormous to face alone. While I agree that Americans shouldn't rely solely on government support - which is already strained - I believe the solution lies in rebuilding community trust and mutual aid rather than isolating ourselves in individual preparation.\n\nThe common narrative about America being built on \"rugged individualism\" is misleading. Our ancestors survived through community, compassion, and resource-sharing. The pioneer wagons reached their destination through cooperation, not isolation.\n\nI advocate for personal preparedness - I maintain emergency supplies, from first-aid kits to non-perishable food. If you can manage sustainable living through farming or food preservation, that's wonderful. But more importantly, invest in your community relationships.\n\nThe real key to survival isn't just stockpiling supplies - it's building connections with those around you.",
            "Around 2500 years ago, in the 5th or 6th century BCE, the man who would become known as the Buddha was born into royalty. His journey to enlightenment and subsequent teachings formed the foundation of Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism emerging as its most traditional branch. The religion has evolved considerably since its inception, as evidenced in practices like Sri Lanka's annual water-cutting ceremony, which, despite having no direct connection to Buddha's original teachings, has become an important religious event for both monks and laypeople. These evolutionary changes extend beyond mere customs to affect the fundamental salvation principles of the faith. The Theravada Buddhist community has adapted its theological principles over time in response to various influences, both from within and outside the faith, some supportive and others antagonistic.\n\nFor clarity, several key terms require definition. Forces originating from within the Buddhasasana (Buddhist community), regardless of whether from monks or laypeople, are considered internal. Those from non-Buddhist sources are external. Hostile forces are those that aim to harm or undermine Buddhism, while benign forces are neutral in intent, though their effects may ultimately help or harm the faith.\n\nThe fundamental principles of Theravada Buddhism center on the triple gem: Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha. The Dhamma is preserved in the Tripitaka, or three baskets of Buddhist scripture: the Sutta Pitaka (discourses), Vinaya Pitaka (disciplinary rules), and Abhidhamma Pitaka (metaphysical teachings). Core concepts include Anatta (non-self), Dukkha (suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Understanding these principles is essential for ending Sansara (the cycle of rebirth) and eliminating lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The religion prescribes behavioral guidelines: five precepts for laypeople (prohibiting killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxication) and additional rules for monks. The foundation of Buddhist doctrine lies in the four noble truths, beginning with the recognition of suffering, its cause in attachment, and the possibility of its cessation."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs.

            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Cultural understanding is essential in negotiations, though culture itself defies simple definition. Rather than being a uniform entity, culture is complex and multifaceted. It's misleading to make sweeping generalizations about national characteristics, such as claiming all people from a particular country share identical traits. Instead, negotiators should focus on understanding how specific cultural aspects influence the negotiation process and interpret these through the lens of their own cultural background.\n\nSuccessfully navigating cultural differences requires comprehensive understanding, from historical context to inherent biases. Rather than criticizing or attempting to modify cultural norms, negotiators should accept and work within them, particularly when in a disadvantaged position. When negotiating in unfamiliar cultural territory, showing respect for local customs and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers.\n\nCultural differences exist not only between nations but also within organizations. Corporate cultures can vary significantly, even within the same country, manifesting in different work schedules, dress codes, communication styles, and philanthropic approaches. Even within American companies, cultural variations can be observed across different regions and settings, demonstrating the complexity of cultural diversity within a single society. While some cultures may appear more homogeneous, deeper examination often reveals subtle variations.\n\nUnderstanding cultural values is crucial as they explain behavioral motivations. For instance, in cultures prioritizing face-saving and group harmony, negotiators won't risk public embarrassment to achieve success. Similarly, those from cultures valuing aggressive negotiation may resist quick settlements. While these cultural patterns are important to consider, successful negotiators also recognize the importance of understanding their counterparts on an individual level.",
            "The passage \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" appears in Psalm 14 and serves as the foundation for both St. Anselm's and Thomas Aquinas's arguments for God's existence. To effectively compare their perspectives, we must accept their shared premise of the Biblical God's existence, rather than considering alternative divine concepts. While both philosophers present compelling arguments, neither provides a complete foundation for divine belief.\n\nSt. Anselm's approach centers on finding divine proof through internal reflection and faith. His argument suggests that since we can comprehend God in our understanding, we cannot truly conceive of His non-existence. Though sometimes complex in its expression, his core message is that divine proof resides within human consciousness, requiring no external validation. This internal validation approach exemplifies the Christian concept of faith.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas proposes that God's existence can be demonstrated purely through rational thinking and observable evidence, without requiring faith. This approach would particularly benefit Christian evangelism, as it could convince potential converts through pure logic rather than requiring acceptance of unprovable concepts. Aquinas presents five logical arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. His methodology resembles completing a puzzle - even with one piece missing, you can deduce its characteristics and existence through logical reasoning based on the surrounding pieces.",
            "Authors employ various literary devices to evoke specific emotions or perspectives in their readers, with some methods proving more successful than others. In The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald demonstrates masterful use of these techniques. He creates unique effects by combining unexpected adjectives with nouns and by developing symbolic meanings through color imagery. Particularly notable is his use of colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. Throughout the novel, Fitzgerald carefully constructs meaning around these colors, especially white/gray and red/pink, using them to trigger specific emotional responses when readers encounter important elements of the story.\n\nThe white/gray color scheme in Fitzgerald's work represents conformity and standardization, with white suggesting refinement and higher social status, while gray indicates aging and deterioration. This symbolism is established early in the novel through repeated references. Characters frequently appear in white attire - Daisy and Jordan are consistently described \"in white,\" Nick dons \"white flannels\" for Gatsby's gathering, Tom appears in a \"white shirt\" during his meeting with Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white.\" The only notable exception occurs during Nick's observations of Gatsby's party, where \"primary colors\" dominate the scene. Fitzgerald reinforces these color associations by applying them to mundane elements: New York's streets become \"white chasms,\" party guests' names fade to \"gray names,\" and Catherine's living space is depicted as part of a uniform \"white cake of apartment-houses.\"\n\nHaving established these color associations, Fitzgerald strategically employs them to convey deeper meaning, particularly in characterizing Daisy. After a period without significant color references, Fitzgerald deliberately presents Daisy \"dressed in white\" in a \"white roadster,\" encouraging readers to view her as a symbol of conformity rather than a fully developed character - merely an object of Gatsby's desire. This characterization is further reinforced through additional white and gray imagery, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and her \"white\" dress before the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County's favorable Mediterranean climate makes it an agricultural powerhouse, yielding diverse crops including vegetables, fruits, honey, and herbs. The region shows strong demand for organic, community-supported agriculture, with local farms often maintaining waitlists. Many organic operations enhance their revenue by offering educational tours and recreational activities, allowing landowners to benefit from government initiatives while supporting wildlife habitat and creating additional income streams.\n\nWhile organic farming promotes greater biodiversity through chemical-free practices, it comes with unique challenges. These include higher labor costs, more intensive management requirements, and potentially lower yields compared to conventional farming. Additional wildlife-friendly practices, such as cover cropping and strategic grazing, further increase operational costs, making financial assistance and expert guidance valuable for balancing profitability with habitat preservation.\n\nThe case study focuses on a 160-acre property near Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. The land, comprising chaparral, Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This area provides habitat for numerous endangered and threatened species, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat and California gnatcatcher.\n\nThe property's history reflects the region's cultural heritage, from its indigenous inhabitants to its late 1800s settlers who used the land for cattle ranching and wood harvesting. Originally established through a homestead patent, the land likely supported grazing and timber production for many years. This case study examined real estate options and government programs available to small farmers interested in sustainable agriculture and wildlife conservation, using a local organic farm as a model.",
            "The relationship between brothers is defined by an eternal, unshakeable connection that encompasses various emotions including affection, honor, envy, and brutality. Siblings share a unique understanding that allows them to see themselves reflected in each other, particularly during challenging times when their true nature emerges. These emotional revelations often come at a significant price, as brothers must face the implications of their feelings and actions. When siblings truly see themselves in each other, they glimpse their authentic selves rather than their public persona.\n\nThis dynamic is powerfully illustrated in \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" where two brothers' relationship unfolds against a richly detailed backdrop. Their journey, though ultimately futile, culminates in a dramatic scene where pride and disappointment collide, resulting in tragedy. The story's themes are conveyed through the characterization of Doodle and his interactions with his brother, while the narrator's perspective reveals the complex emotional landscape that drives their actions.\n\nThe protagonist's behavior is fundamentally driven by pride. He harbors resentment toward his brother Doodle from their earliest interactions, having dreamed of a sibling who could match him in physical activities like swimming, running, and climbing. Doodle's severe heart condition makes these aspirations impossible, crushing the protagonist's expectations. The narrator's initial hostility toward Doodle is so severe that he even contemplates murder, though this dark impulse is dispelled by Doodle's innocent smile. This transformation reveals an underlying love beneath the surface, suggesting that his negative feelings weren't deeply rooted but rather stemmed from disappointed expectations.",
            "The human brain functions as a sophisticated information processor with remarkable complexity and inventiveness. Our understanding of it has evolved alongside technology, with historical comparisons ranging from wax tablets to modern computers, though it's important to note these analogies have their limitations.\n\nThe brain's information processing begins when sensory organs convert physical stimuli into electrochemical signals. These signals undergo dual processing: bottom-up processing assembles basic sensory data (like colors and edges) into recognizable objects, while top-down processing uses existing knowledge to enhance and speed up recognition. For instance, when viewing a black box against white space, both processes work together to help you correctly interpret what you're seeing.\n\nThe brain employs an attention filtering system to prioritize information processing. This system determines which signals deserve conscious awareness - for example, filtering out individual grass blades while walking but highlighting personally relevant information like hearing your name in a crowded space.\n\nInformation storage in the brain occurs through multiple memory systems: sensory, working, and long-term memory. Information undergoes encoding specific to its sensory type - verbal information, for example, can be encoded based on appearance, sound, or meaning. Working memory temporarily stores information through neural electrical circuits lasting about 20 seconds, while long-term memory appears to be preserved through protein structures.\n\nKnowledge organization in the brain has been explained through various models, drawing from human memory studies, computer science, and neurophysiology. One prominent model, the semantic network, suggests that information is organized as interconnected concept nodes. For example, mental concepts like \"chair\" connect to related concepts like \"table\" and \"wooden\" in an elaborate network of associations.",
            "The 2007 financial crisis in the United States caused widespread economic devastation, marked by rising unemployment, a housing market collapse, and the downfall of major corporations. This economic downturn's effects continue to resonate, prompting critical questions about its origins and prevention. The crisis emerged from misguided political decisions that encouraged banks to issue risky subprime loans within an inadequate financial system. The situation worsened when government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were compelled to convert these mortgages into complex financial instruments (CDOs and CDS'). When borrowers began defaulting, banks' insufficient capital reserves triggered a chain reaction that contaminated the broader economy.\n\nThe crisis's origins can be traced to 1999 during President Clinton's administration. Seeking re-election, Clinton's team loosened lending regulations, inadvertently setting the stage for the subsequent subprime crisis. A New York Times journalist, Steven Holmes, presciently warned about Fannie Mae's increased pressure to expand lending to lower-income borrowers while maintaining profit growth. Holmes accurately predicted that such practices could require government intervention during an economic downturn.\n\nThe crisis was amplified by innovative but risky mortgage products. The widespread use of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs created deep interconnections between the housing market and other economic sectors. This led to excessive leverage among U.S. households and financial markets, making them highly susceptible to price fluctuations.\n\nWhen housing prices eventually collapsed, financial institutions holding mortgage-backed securities suffered severe consequences. The five largest U.S. investment banks reported mortgage debts of $4.1 trillion in 2007, representing roughly 30% of the nation's GDP. This led to the fire sale of Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers' collapse, and forced Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to convert to commercial banks.

While writers might feel tempted to showcase their literary prowess through lengthy explanations, this often leads to readers losing interest or becoming frustrated. Even experienced writers sometimes fall into the trap of including excessive information that doesn't serve the story.\n\nRemember: exposition isn't your ally in storytelling.\n\nWhile most writers are familiar with the golden rule \"Show, don't tell,\" it's easy to fall into the trap of writing lengthy passages where either nothing significant occurs or too much information is dumped at once. Writers often face two temptations: either rushing through background information to get to the exciting parts, or overwhelming readers with unnecessary details about characters' histories.\n\nExposition is essentially narrative explanation - telling rather than showing what happened. In movies, it often appears as information-heavy dialogue between characters, while in written fiction, it's the author directly explaining things to readers.\n\nConsider this scenario: imagine reading about a heroine's life where her meeting, marriage, and her husband's tragic murder are condensed into two pages with minimal dialogue. This approach fails to engage readers emotionally. Instead, the story should demonstrate the husband's character through his actions and words, showing how he enriched the heroine's life. This deeper characterization helps readers form an emotional connection and better understand both characters, making the tragedy more impactful.\n\nThe key is to flesh out the basic plot points with meaningful details and character development.\n\nWriters must resist the urge to rapidly list character traits and backstory (like someone's military service, current job, marital status, hobbies, and breakfast preferences) without proper development. Such information dumps often disconnect readers from the story rather than drawing them in.",
            "I analyzed two news broadcasts from NBC 4 in Columbus, Ohio on August 13, 2011. The primary story covered a domestic violence incident in Ashley, Ohio, where Shad Hostettler allegedly stabbed his wife multiple times. The brief two-minute coverage seemed appropriate given the developing nature of the story.\n\nThe broadcast then covered the critical shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area, with SWAT Team involvement and no immediate suspects. I noticed the coverage was notably brief, which appeared to reflect a concerning pattern of minimal media attention when victims are minorities, contrasting with the extensive coverage typically given to white victims.\n\nFollowing this was a report about a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter, identified as caused by a .22 caliber rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.\n\nThe weather segment briefly discussed predicted rain and thunderstorms, with weekend temperatures expected in the mid to low eighties. This seemed intentionally short to maintain viewer interest.\n\nThe coverage included a UDF store robbery on Clime Road in Columbus, where I noticed disproportionate emphasis on the suspect's race and skin tone in the description. The final story detailed the conviction of Texas Drug-Kingpin Rene Rodriguez for marijuana distribution to Ohio. Interestingly, they expressed his 25-year sentence as \"300 months\" and unnecessarily highlighted his ethnicity.",
            "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are investment vehicles that track specific market segments while offering stock-like trading flexibility. They combine the diversification benefits of index funds with stock trading features, including short selling, margin buying, and single-share purchasing options. While ETFs charge lower fees compared to typical mutual funds, investors must pay trading commissions similar to stocks. The market offers a diverse range of ETF options, though prudent investors should carefully verify claimed benefits such as diversification.\n\nThis analysis focuses on the ETF IHF, comparing it with its top 10 holdings to assess whether owning the ETF provides similar advantages to holding a diverse portfolio of its constituent stocks. We'll also explore if alternative configurations of these stocks might yield better performance metrics.\n\nFor practical purposes, our analysis concentrates on the top 10 holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. By normalizing these holdings to 100%, we can calculate how each stock contributes to the portfolio's Beta and Return, comparing these metrics to the complete ETF.\n\nThe analysis reveals that a portfolio containing just the top 10 holdings outperforms the ETF by 6.11% (a 16% return increase) while maintaining a Beta that's 0.12 lower than the full ETF. Though these results suggest superior performance from the top 10 holdings portfolio, further statistical analysis is needed to determine if the performance difference is statistically significant. This evaluation requires calculating and normalizing the standard deviation of each top 10 stock for comparison with the ETF IHF's overall standard deviation.",
            "Analysis of Figure 17 reveals a significant decline in commuter log submissions during the project's third month. This decline can be attributed to several factors. The winter season in New England naturally reduces bicycle and pedestrian commuting. The timing coincides with the fall semester's end, when the academic community is overwhelmed with final assignments and grading. The holiday season and subsequent academic break also contribute to reduced campus attendance. While these factors explain the December and January dips, the February decline remains somewhat puzzling. It's possible that this reflects a natural waning of enthusiasm following the initial project launch. To counter this downward trend, we implemented a Carpool Challenge Week in March, which successfully boosted participation.\n\nA key challenge was maintaining momentum despite both natural engagement decline and academic calendar disruptions. Additionally, we faced the deeply ingrained American cultural preference for personal vehicle use, which emphasizes convenience and independence. To encourage alternative transportation, we distributed incentives such as gift certificates to local businesses. In retrospect, offering increasingly valuable prizes throughout the project timeline - perhaps escalating from gift cards to major items like bicycles or even eco-friendly vehicles - might have been more effective in sustaining participation. While our initial incentives proved adequate, introducing progressively more substantial rewards could have prevented the observed participation decline and potentially increased engagement during traditionally low-participation periods.",
            "While examining the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I analyzed fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These productions utilized innovative editing techniques to create magical effects. My research primarily concentrated on analyzing the common characteristics of these trick films while noting some unique features that emerged in later examples. The typical trick film of this era was characterized by several conventions: it was filmed on a set, used a front-facing theatrical view, maintained a static camera position, employed long to medium camera distances, and consisted of what appeared to be a single continuous shot.\n\nThese films consistently shared the theatrical staging approach, filming indoor scenes from a fixed front view similar to a stage performance. The camera remained stationary rather than tracking the action or subjects. This style, deeply influenced by theater and magic show presentations, resulted in predominantly lateral movement of performers, who rarely approached or retreated from the camera. This is exemplified in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where actors move horizontally across the frame while the camera maintains its position.\n\nThe theatrical composition naturally led to the predominant use of long shots and occasional medium shots, completely avoiding close-ups. This mirrored the theatrical experience where audiences viewed the entire stage continuously. The middle-ground positioning of actors, who seldom moved toward the camera, eliminated any opportunity for close-up shots.\n\nMost of these early trick films appeared to consist of a single shot, typically running under a minute. This format limited their storytelling potential, resulting in brief vaudeville-style performances featuring magic tricks, disappearances, and transformations rather than complex narratives. However, what appeared as one continuous shot to viewers often comprised multiple shots cleverly edited together to create illusions. \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) demonstrates this technique, where careful observation reveals the subtle transition point where the shot of the \"severed head\" is incorporated, though it appears seamless to casual viewers.",
            "The Gothic Novel presents an inherent contradiction, combining \"old\" and \"new\" elements as noted by Ian Watt. This literary form has faced mixed reception, with critics both dismissing it as shallow and celebrating its ability to evoke the sublime, as Burke observed. Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, considered the first Gothic novel, merged classical romantic elements with modern storytelling techniques to establish the genre's foundation. Walpole blended traditional theatrical components with contemporary narrative approaches to create what he called \"A Gothic Story.\"\n\nThe genre heavily draws from medieval theatrical traditions, architectural elements, and cultural customs. By Otranto's publication, the term \"gothic\" had acquired multiple meanings across various contexts and was often viewed as primitive compared to modern developments in society and literature. The genre's enduring appeal stems from its unique fusion of theatrical Gothic elements with the novel's capacity for psychological insight, making it simultaneously timeless and contemporary for readers across different eras.\n\nChivalry emerges as a central Gothic theme, particularly in The Castle of Otranto. The medieval chivalric code, which outlined knightly conduct, is both preserved and transformed in the novel. Gothic authors, especially Walpole, emphasized chivalry to highlight the perceived decline of noble ideals in their contemporary society. This idealization of the medieval past, which foreshadowed the Romantic movement, served as a critique of present conditions. Walpole, writing during political turmoil, appeared to long for the moral certainty of the gothic era, believing it absent in his time. This perspective is evident in his characterization of Frederic, who embodies traditional chivalric virtues but is portrayed with typical Gothic excess, as seen in his depiction as a noble prince who has endured hardship and is believed to have died fighting infidels.",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the entire process of moving products from initial customer orders through raw materials, production, and final distribution. This term was first introduced by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982 to describe the comprehensive process of planning, implementing, and controlling supply chain operations to meet customer needs efficiently. The framework consists of six crucial components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information, which business managers utilize to optimize customer service.\n\nProduction, the initial phase, serves as the cornerstone of the supply chain process. During this stage, managers must determine the what, when, where, and how of production. They analyze market trends to understand customer demands, which guides decisions about product types and quantities. Once these factors are established, managers select appropriate production facilities based on volume capabilities and quality requirements, while ensuring customer satisfaction remains paramount. The production phase also involves careful planning of workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. The importance of meticulous planning in this phase cannot be overstated, as demonstrated by major retailers like Walmart and Target, which maintain detailed protocols for every aspect of their operations, from employee dress codes to shipment handling.\n\nSupply, the second key element, involves making strategic decisions about facility capabilities and potential outsourcing partnerships. Companies often operate multiple production divisions for a single product, each with its own equipment, workforce, and specialized capabilities. Managers must determine the most suitable division for each production process and may opt for outsourcing to achieve velocity – the ability to maintain quality and flexibility while optimizing costs.",
            "The Victorian era's literary landscape was dominated by novels known for their meticulous detail and aristocratic focus. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights stand apart from this convention. These works incorporate mysterious elements and unusual narratives that deviate from typical Victorian literature, which serves to enhance character development and provide deeper insights into their psychological states and motivations.\n\nThe novels frequently employ dream sequences and hallucinatory states as literary devices, though each work uses them differently. In Oliver Twist, these supernatural moments often illuminate Oliver's inner consciousness, revealing his emotional struggles and his growing understanding of his circumstances. Chapter 28's depiction of Oliver's shooting demonstrates this technique effectively. In the scene, Oliver experiences a dreamlike state where he relives the shooting, interacting with hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The passage emphasizes Oliver's powerlessness and deteriorating physical condition through his sensory confusion and persistent pain.\n\nThe scene's portrayal of Oliver's overwhelming helplessness raises questions about agency and fate. His inability to respond actively to life-threatening danger suggests both his fundamental powerlessness and the possibility that Fagin's influence has begun to erode his will to resist. The passage's description of time's distortion - with day barely existing and night becoming paradoxically both endless and brief - further reinforces the character's psychological distress and loss of control.",
            "While working as a tutor in an after-school program, I encountered a young Latino student named Adrian who struggled with reading. Despite speaking flawless English, he had unusual difficulties with certain letters. The mystery was solved when I met his Spanish-speaking mother - Adrian's reading challenges stemmed from unfamiliarity with the English alphabet rather than comprehension issues.\n\nThis experience highlights the complexities of language barriers in education, particularly in California. Even students who speak English fluently may face unexpected challenges with reading. While Adrian's situation required focused tutoring on English alphabet and pronunciation, many students with limited English proficiency need more comprehensive solutions. No single approach - whether dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, or ESL classes - can solve this issue alone. Success requires implementing multiple strategies simultaneously.\n\nThe dual language system, in particular, shows promise for all students, not just Spanish speakers. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs perform better academically than their peers. While some worry this approach wastes resources or only benefits a minority, making bilingual education standard practice would advantage everyone. Rather than requiring all teachers to be bilingual (which would be impractical), schools could employ bilingual specialists and tutors to support this approach.",
            "Most of us grow up learning about a higher power - something beyond our mortal understanding. Whether through religious institutions or personal exploration, we seek spiritual meaning. While some embrace their inherited faith, others reject it entirely, convinced that nothing exists beyond their own reality. Our spiritual journey often involves trying different belief systems as we attempt to find our place in the universe and seek guidance through life's darkness.\n\nI remember a conversation with my father on our porch during a rainstorm, sharing cigarettes as water cascaded from the gutters. When I asked about his favorite bird, he mentioned the cardinal, his gaze distant and contemplative. His illness had taken its toll - his clothes hung loose, his hair thinning. Words about his impending departure remained unspoken between us, too painful to acknowledge. Instead, we sat closer together, watching the rain fall in the growing darkness.\n\nThat December, shortly after I turned twenty-two, my father died. The aggressive treatments had only prolonged his suffering beyond the doctors' estimates, leaving me questioning the purpose of such extended pain. My faith wavered; I stopped praying, feeling abandoned by a God I no longer understood.\n\nI chose not to witness his final moments, wanting to preserve memories of his life rather than his death. Understanding him as only a child could, I knew he wouldn't want me to watch his passing. I isolated myself for three days, waiting for news of his death. The news never came through a phone call - I was left to face this profound loss in solitude.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline, though primarily a farmer, emerged as a passionate advocate for Republicanism, with his agricultural background deeply influencing his views on government, personal liberty, and civic matters. His farming perspective shaped his positions on sovereignty, constitutional interpretation, and judicial matters.\n\nTaylor saw America's unique position as advantageous, believing the absence of established traditions allowed for creating an authentic system of self-governance. He championed the interconnected nature of natural rights, arguing that compromising one right would inevitably weaken all others, thus placing them beyond governmental control. He criticized the notion that society should mirror nature's law of might-makes-right.\n\nIn Taylor's vision of an ideal society, government needed to address humanity's moral duality. He maintained that governmental systems reflect human virtues and flaws alike. His definition of positive principles centered on protecting private property, advancing agriculture, and resisting capitalism. Taylor believed that self-interest, while fundamental to human nature, became problematic only when it prioritized special interests over public welfare. He advocated for governmental oversight to check humanity's negative tendencies while remaining vigilant against corrupt principles.\n\nAs a committed Republican, Taylor advocated for strict constitutional interpretation and minimal federal authority, limiting government powers to those explicitly stated in the Constitution. He warned against an expansive federal system, seeing it as potentially tyrannical due to its cost. However, he cautioned against overly literal constitutional interpretation, emphasizing the importance of considering the founders' intent. Notably, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as the nation's true founding document, as it better reflected his view of America as a union of sovereign states rather than a single unified nation.",
            "I gazed downward, observing the scene before me with detached neutrality. My mind processed what I saw mechanically, refusing to form emotional connections. Thoughts flowed through my consciousness like water, creating an almost pure sensory experience rather than coherent reflection.\n\nI once bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" on a fellow artist's recommendation, hoping to fulfill my childhood dream of learning to draw. The book taught everything from basic tool handling to complex mental processes. One key technique involved using a frame to simplify complex scenes - turning an intricate kitchen scene into a manageable still life of a fruit bowl.\n\nIn this moment, however, I couldn't apply such artistic framing. I was too captivated by what lay before me. While great artists had their signature colors - Picasso's blue period, Monet's greens, the Renaissance masters' vibrant palettes - here was the beginning of my own artistic statement: a study in brown.\n\nMy fingers grasped my tool as I prepared for what could have been my masterpiece. The water moved gracefully, clear and pristine. Particles separated and disappeared into the current. With increasing urgency, I hit the toilet handle again, but the stubborn brown mass remained fixed to the bowl's bottom, unmoved.\n\nThere I stood in my Rite Aid uniform, green tie choking my neck, mop in hand, contemplating this unwanted \"gift\" left by some inconsiderate customer. After several unsuccessful flushes and moments of philosophical reflection, I reached for toilet paper, wrapping my hand thoroughly until it resembled protective wear. Then, like reaching for a roasting turkey, I reluctantly lowered my hand toward the bowl...",
            "Young drivers face a significant mortality risk on the roads. Multiple elements contribute to this dangerous situation affecting America's youngest motorists. Research from the National Institutes of Health indicates that adolescents' cognitive development hasn't reached the level necessary for safe driving. Lack of experience is another crucial factor, leading to higher instances of fatal crashes, vehicle flips, excessive speed, and road departures.\n\nThe presence of peer passengers significantly increases risk factors - a common scenario among teen drivers. Research conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center demonstrates a clear link between passenger age and accident frequency.\n\nWhile states like California have implemented provisional licensing systems limiting driving hours and passenger numbers for teens, these measures may be insufficient. Statistics consistently show that young drivers struggle to manage driving risks and responsibilities effectively. Research by psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, as reported in USA Today, indicates that even 18-year-olds may be too young to drive safely, citing their natural inclination toward thrill-seeking behavior. This tendency suggests that delaying driving privileges until this risk-taking propensity diminishes could be beneficial. The situation becomes more pressing considering the impending surge of new teen drivers as Baby Boomers' children reach driving age.\n\nA potential solution could involve nationwide legislation establishing 18 as the minimum driving age. This framework would maintain driver's education in schools while implementing a graduated licensing system with mandatory training hours, similar to existing state requirements like California's model of 6 hours of professional instruction and 50 hours of supervised practice. Given that teen driving statistics show similar patterns across states, implementing uniform national standards could effectively address this safety concern.\n\nThis proposed legislative approach builds upon existing concepts rather than introducing entirely new ideas.",
            "This research examines Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) across three key aspects. It begins with a definition, followed by diagnostic procedures and identifiable traits, and concludes with classroom accommodation strategies for teachers working with CAPD students in mainstream settings.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), involves the brain's ability to process auditory information effectively. While individuals with CAPD have normal hearing capabilities, their brains struggle to properly interpret and process auditory inputs, such as distinguishing between different sounds or filtering out background noise.\n\nThe disorder was first identified in the 1950s under the term \"auditory imperception.\" Italian scientists Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari pioneered testing methods in 1954, followed by Kimura's breakthrough in dichotic testing in 1961. A significant 1977 national conference sparked increased research interest in pediatric CAPD.\n\nCAPD symptoms are diverse, including difficulties with: sound localization, distinguishing between different sounds, recognizing sound patterns, detecting vocal nuances (like sarcasm), processing sequential sounds, synthesizing audio information meaningfully, and processing sounds in the correct order.\n\nDiagnosis requires comprehensive evaluation through various methods, including behavioral observations and auditory function assessments. Multiple professionals, such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists, may be involved in the diagnostic process. Currently, there is no single standardized diagnostic tool, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Diagnostic procedures often involve tests with multiple simultaneous audio stimuli, requiring patients to differentiate specific elements, and may include sophisticated acoustic response measurements.",
            "My goal in pursuing social work education is to build a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on supporting troubled families and protecting abused or neglected children. I bring essential qualities to the social work profession, including dedication to service, respectful behavior, ethical conduct, and a commitment to fostering better relationships while maintaining professional growth. These principles aren't merely professional requirements – they reflect my personal values.\n\nMy journey to social work wasn't straightforward. During my academic years, I observed many peers avoiding their problems or adopting unhealthy coping mechanisms, which led me to earn a Psychology degree from Piedmont College in 2009. A pivotal moment occurred that summer when I met a teenage boy seeking refuge from abusive parents at a friend's house. After he reported his parents to the police, I visited their home to help. When speaking with the officers and parents, I noticed the parents' defensive behavior as they dismissed serious family conflicts as \"simple disputes.\" This experience crystallized my decision to pursue social work, specifically to advocate for children in troubled family situations.\n\nSocial justice is another cornerstone of my professional and personal philosophy. I've always questioned society's paradoxical approach to individuality – claiming to value it while simultaneously promoting conformity. Throughout my academic years, I actively challenged social injustice through various forms of self-expression: sporting unconventional hair colors, embracing unique fashion choices, getting multiple piercings, openly supporting LGBTQ+ rights through GSBA involvement, and consistently opposing racism and discrimination. My commitment to social justice remains unwavering, and I continue to stand against societal inequities.",
            "This paper examines insomnia through the lens of both Biological and Sociocultural models. While the biological perspective examines inherited genetic factors and medical conditions, the sociocultural approach investigates how environmental factors, including race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status, influence the condition. The paper analyzes various research studies related to these models and evaluates their strengths and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified into three main categories: primary sleep disorders, those connected to other mental disorders, and those linked to various other causes. Primary sleep disorders are further divided into Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while mental disorder-related sleep issues are connected to Axis I or Axis II conditions. Medical conditions or substance use can cause other sleep disorders. Dyssomnias include several conditions, notably Primary Insomnia (difficulty sleeping) and Primary Hypersomnia (difficulty staying awake), both requiring a month-long duration for diagnosis. Other conditions include Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia NOS. Parasomnias, which involve abnormal behaviors or physiological events during sleep, include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias NOS.\n\nThe biological model emphasizes the role of genetics and physiology in sleep disorders. Research has shown that orexin-containing neurons in the hypothalamus control sleep-wake cycles, with GABAB receptors playing a crucial role. Studies on mice demonstrated that GABAA receptor activation promotes sleep, while GABAB agonists increase sleep duration. These findings suggest potential genetic and environmental influences on human sleep patterns, with receptor dysfunction potentially requiring medical intervention. Such biological factors can significantly impact an individual's daily functioning, affecting their academic, professional, and personal lives.",
            "As a student who has spent over two years at University Park, I've experienced firsthand the challenges of campus navigation. My experience began in East Halls, situated at the campus's eastern edge, where a simple journey to central locations like Willard building could consume nearly half an hour on foot, particularly during State College's frequently adverse weather conditions. The campus has undergone significant transformation - what was once vacant land surrounding East Halls has been developed into athletic fields, modern facilities like the new Creamery and health services building, and residential complexes. This expansion has made campus navigation increasingly challenging.\n\nThe optimal solution to this mobility challenge is cycling, though its effectiveness depends on both student participation and appropriate infrastructure. This perspective was reinforced by a conversation with a friend who had recently returned to cycling, acknowledging its practicality and efficiency. Bicycling not only promotes physical health but also represents the most energy-efficient mode of transportation - a simple breakfast can fuel a 30-mile journey.\n\nLiving off-campus now, at a distance comparable to some dorms, I've found that purchasing a bicycle was an extremely wise choice. It has transformed what would be a 25-minute walk to Thomas building into a mere 5-minute ride. While Pollock Road offers the most direct route, it presents its own challenges for cyclists. Though walking remains an option, it's impractical for my schedule. Without a bicycle, I would spend an additional 2.5 hours weekly just walking to and from Thomas building alone, not counting other campus destinations. This significant time investment makes cycling not just convenient, but necessary for managing my busy schedule efficiently.",
            "In Brave New World, Aldous Huxley presents a critique of advancing technology and capitalism through a dystopian society where communal values supersede individual identity, and instant gratification is the primary goal. The World Controller manipulates the population, who are essentially trapped within a prescribed way of thinking. Through a Marxist interpretation, the novel reveals Huxley's skepticism toward these developing systems, employing concepts like homogeneity and reification to comment on contemporary economic trends.\n\nThe novel illustrates the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where the masses are kept ignorant of true class relationships due to their focus on personal gain. This is demonstrated through the conditioning of lower castes (Delta, Gamma, etc.), who are programmed through hypnopædia to perpetually consume and indulge. The concept of hegemony is evident as the ruling class maintains complete control over subordinate classes, who unknowingly support the capitalistic structure. While upper classes (Alphas and Betas) have the potential for awareness, most, except for few individuals like Bernard, accept their predetermined roles without question.\n\nThe novel portrays a world devoid of meaningful personal connections, with characters lacking psychological depth – possibly suggesting that the combination of technology and capitalism strips humanity of its essence. Genuine emotions, including love, are absent, replaced by superficial interactions characterized by physical observations and casual sexual encounters. The various social classes' acceptance of their positions reflects capitalism's socioeconomic impact, with each group conditioned to believe in their purpose while continuing to consume and conform, exemplifying the Marxist view of how the proletariat is manipulated through false consciousness.",
            "Reflecting on a college course about Islam I took nearly four years ago, I remember how we debated whether Islam was inherently hostile - a question that remains particularly relevant today. The media's portrayal of Islam has notably shifted from post-9/11 hostility to what seems like excessive accommodation, exemplified by the historic presidency bid of Barack Obama, despite his family's Muslim connections.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography presents an interesting contradiction to my previous understanding of his character. While historical accounts I'm familiar with portrayed him as someone who forcibly converted conquered peoples to Islam, the biography depicts him as a misunderstood, humble figure whose teachings naturally attracted followers.\n\nI noticed striking parallels between Jesus's ministry and Muhammad's reported miracles, such as the story of multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men. This narrative approach seems designed to present Muhammad as a modest prophet who performed miracles matter-of-factly. However, this appears to diminish Jesus's unique miracles and ministry by creating similar stories around Muhammad.\n\nThe biography frequently relies on chain-narrative testimonials about conversions to Islam, where stories are passed down through multiple sources. Rather than strengthening the authenticity of these accounts, this method of storytelling actually makes them seem less credible.\n\nMost concerning is the biography's portrayal of Muhammad as a humble, wise, and gentle religious leader, which appears to conflict with historical records of his rise to power. This raises questions about whether contemporary Muslims are aware of the historical context of Muhammad's ascension to leadership.",
            "Christianity rapidly diverged from Jesus's original teachings after his death, with successive generations moving increasingly away from its initial form. Today, despite resistance from traditionalists, there's a growing progressive consciousness that may lead to significant changes in Christian thought. In the coming years, Christians are likely to develop a stronger interest in distinguishing between original teachings and later additions to their faith. This will eventually trigger a massive reversal in Christian history, with believers gradually stripping away accumulated doctrines to rediscover Jesus's original message.\n\nThis movement will likely spread throughout Western nations, prompting people to worship in ways that mirror early Christianity. While churches will maintain their institutional importance, the current diversity in Christian denominations will gradually give way to greater uniformity in beliefs and practices. This pattern of dramatic historical reversals isn't unprecedented – consider how the Roman Empire shifted from persecuting Christians to embracing Christianity, or how America evolved from slavery to having African-American leaders.\n\nThis religious transformation will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus's teachings metaphorically rather than literally. To understand this evolution, we must look back to Christianity's roots in Judaism. Before the Roman occupation of Jerusalem in 63 BCE, Judaism had already established its core principles of monotheism, divine revelation, and biblical authority. The Jewish community was diverse, split between various groups including Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general population.",
            "Through the lens of The Jungle, we can observe humanity's inherent selfishness and greed. The novel illustrates how people prioritize their own advancement while disregarding those beneath them in social status. This theme is particularly evident in the portrayal of factory owners and managers, who relentlessly pursue corporate growth and profits with complete disregard for collateral damage.\n\nSinclair vividly depicts this through imagery of industrial devastation, describing factories with \"great chimneys\" spewing endless streams of smoke into the sky. This portrayal emphasizes the owners' indifference to environmental damage and public health, as they ignore the consequences of industrial pollution and unsanitary conditions in Packingtown's animal pens.\n\nThe exploitation extends deeply into labor practices. The workplace is described as a \"seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds\" where profit consistently trumps human dignity. Workers face arbitrary layoffs, dangerous working conditions, and exhausting schedules, with no job security or protective regulations. The absence of labor laws during this period allowed management to prioritize productivity over worker safety and wellbeing.\n\nThe situation in Packingtown created a system of de facto slavery, particularly affecting poor immigrants. Workers were trapped in a cycle of poverty and exploitation, with no meaningful support systems or legitimate organizations to defend their rights. While labor unions existed, they often exploited rather than helped workers. The novel draws a direct parallel between these industrial workers and chattel slavery, noting that under such desperate conditions, where survival depends on the whims of ruthless employers, moral degradation becomes inevitable.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-land\" among his finest poetic works. The poem features the word \"Thulé\" twice, which has historical roots in Virgil's writings about a mysterious northern island beyond Britain that marked the boundary of the ancient Greek world. While Virgil's influence is undeniable, there's a more contemporary source worth noting, given Poe's known appreciation of German literature.\n\nThis connection is particularly significant as it demonstrates Poe's knowledge of Goethe's work. Scholar Karl J. Arndt has noted the similarities between their poetry, suggesting Poe drew inspiration from Goethe.\n\nGoethe, as noted in the Oxford Companion to English Literature, was renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two segments (1808 and 1832). Within \"Faust Part Two\" lies \"The King of Thulé,\" a poignant tale about a grieving king who, after receiving a goblet from his dying wife, succumbs to drinking and eventually chooses death, throwing the cherished goblet into the ocean. The parallels between this king and the narrator in \"Dream-Land\" suggest a possible reflection of Poe's own struggles with loss and alcohol.\n\nPoe uses \"Thule\" in both \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land,\" with the latter featuring it prominently as bookends. Reading \"Dream-Land\" alongside \"The King of Thulé\" reveals striking thematic similarities: both works explore themes of darkness, loneliness, and haunting memories. The speaker in \"Dream-Land\" seems to inhabit the same melancholic world as Goethe's king.\n\nPoe's familiarity with Goethe would have been natural, not only through the German author's various contemporary adaptations but also through Poe's admiration of Tennyson, who was known to appreciate Goethe's work.",
            "This case examines whether punitive damages could be awarded in California for a slip-and-fall incident at D&D Markets. The incident occurred when Jennifer Palmer fell on an unremedied applesauce spill, resulting in serious back injuries. The store manager, Paul Martin, had been notified twice about the spill but ignored it for 30 minutes while on his dinner break.\n\nThe legal analysis suggests Palmer's punitive damage claim would likely survive summary dismissal. Under California Civil Code § 3294(a), punitive damages can be awarded if a defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Malice is defined as either intentional harm or \"despicable\" conduct showing willful disregard for others' safety. The precedent set in Taylor v. Superior Court establishes that malicious conduct includes cases where defendants are aware of probable dangers but deliberately fail to address them.\n\nPalmer's case is strengthened by several factors: The manager was notified twice about the hazard, six similar accidents had occurred at the store in 2009, and Martin deliberately ignored the situation despite knowing the risks. While proving the conduct was \"despicable\" might be challenging, Palmer can make a reasonable argument that Martin's conscious disregard for customer safety, especially given the store's history of accidents, meets the legal threshold for punitive damages under California law.",
            "There was an emptiness within her that persisted, starting at age 14 and continuing through her seventeenth year. As time passed, she realized it wasn't a thing she yearned for, but rather a person. Curiously, despite receiving attention from various boys, none sparked her interest. This peculiarity led to considerable self-reflection, though she never reached any satisfactory conclusions about her romantic indifference. She simply continued living while pondering these feelings.\n\nHer home life was typically serene, with parents who rarely quarreled, either with each other or with her. The only occasional tensions arose from her strong-willed, independent nature. While her parents embodied tranquility, she possessed a vibrant, outgoing personality that, combined with her kindness, made her well-liked by others.\n\nHowever, this particular day shattered their usual peace when her mother's scream echoed from the kitchen. Rushing to investigate, she found her mother sprawled on the floor, clearly in agony. Between labored breaths, her mother requested to be taken to the hospital. Thanks to her strength training, she managed to carry her mother to the car and place her in the backseat.\n\nAt the hospital, despite the typical clinical atmosphere heavy with anxiety and antiseptic, she remained focused solely on her mother's wellbeing. She rushed in carrying her mother, calling urgently for medical assistance. Healthcare workers quickly transferred her mother to a gurney and whisked her away for examination, leaving the daughter to wait anxiously.\n\nThe incident, it turned out, had occurred when her mother fell while trying to retrieve a vase from the topmost cabinet using a stepstool.",
            "The research aimed to demonstrate that following a Mediterranean Diet (Med diet), measured by the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" helps reduce the likelihood of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and related deaths. The aMed diet, a variation of the traditional Mediterranean diet, emphasizes consuming more plant-based foods (fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, but not potatoes), fish, and monounsaturated fats while limiting animal products and saturated fats. It also permits moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious research has shown that following a Mediterranean diet is linked to lower overall and cardiovascular mortality rates. Additionally, a clinical trial demonstrated that the Med diet was superior to low-fat diets in achieving weight loss and improving cholesterol ratios in obese people. However, these earlier studies didn't specifically examine stroke outcomes.\n\nThe investigation tracked 74,886 female nurses aged 38-63 years, who had no previous cardiovascular disease or diabetes, as part of the larger Nurses' Health Study involving 121,700 women across 11 US states. Between 1984 and 2004, researchers calculated aMed diet scores six times using validated food frequency questionnaires (FFQs). The study maintained over 95% participation throughout its 20-year duration. Cases of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical records, autopsies, or death certificates, with some cases (17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal heart attacks) classified as \"probable\" when records were unavailable.\n\nTo better represent long-term dietary patterns, researchers used cumulative averages of aMed scores from repeated FFQs. They controlled for potential confounding factors including age, smoking, body mass index, hormonal factors, supplement use, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, they analyzed the relationship between aMed scores and cardiovascular outcomes. The results showed that women with higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet had significantly lower risks of both CHD and stroke. Over the 20-year study period, they documented 2,391 CHD cases, 1,763 stroke cases, and 1,077 cardiovascular deaths. Women in the highest aMed score category showed a 29% lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest category.",
            "A photo captures actress Ellen Page (now known as Elliot Page) holding a cardboard sign with an unsettling message linking Hitler to Burma. Burma (Myanmar), a Southeast Asian nation, has been under military control since a 1962 coup. In 2007, the country witnessed its first major protests in ten years, dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution\" due to the Buddhist monks' distinctive robes who led the demonstrations. While initially peaceful, these protests escalated into violent confrontations between monks and the military regime, which began raiding monasteries nationwide. Foreign media faced severe persecution, exemplified by the killing of Japanese photographer Kenji Nagai. Though official records cite 13 deaths, defected Colonel Hla Win suggested thousands were actually killed.\n\nThis pattern of governmental oppression isn't unique to modern times. Throughout history, rulers have sought absolute control over their populations. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, Japanese emperors were considered deities, and modern political leaders often align themselves with influential religious figures to maintain power.\n\nSimilar instances of authoritarian violence include the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in China, where casualty figures vary dramatically between government reports (200-300) and Red Cross estimates (2,000-3,000). The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s saw government-backed Hutu militias systematically eliminating Tutsis and political moderates. The Holocaust under Hitler's Third Reich, targeting Jews across multiple countries, stands as another devastating example of state-sponsored violence.",
            "Duke Ellington's influence on jazz is primarily attributed to his enduring career and exceptional ability to mold his orchestra's sound. While his piano work may be understated in many compositions, his genius as a composer shone through in creating intricate pieces that capitalized on his musicians' individual talents. He expertly designed musical frameworks that balanced structured orchestration with room for improvisation, tailoring parts to highlight each band member's unique style. This approach resulted in distinctive orchestral sounds that perfectly suited each composition. His deep understanding of both individual musicians and ensemble dynamics enabled him to create some of jazz's most groundbreaking works.\n\nCreole Love Call, as noted in the Grove Music dictionary, exemplifies Ellington's innovative use of vocals as a pure instrumental element, free from lyrics. This twelve-bar blues composition, structured in six choruses, demonstrates his skill in complementing soloists:\n\nThe first chorus features an interplay between voice and reeds, evolving from smooth to rougher tones.\nThe second showcases a muted trumpet solo expanding on the main melody.\nThe third presents a high-register clarinet solo with subtle piano accompaniment.\nThe fourth involves the full band recreating the opening chorus's call-and-response pattern.\nThe fifth reaches its peak with high-register reeds leading the call-and-response.\nThe sixth revisits the opening structure but incorporates vocal \"growl\" technique.\nThe piece concludes with a brief tag combining a vocal run and dissonant trombone ending.\n\nThis innovative vocal approach became a hallmark of Ellington's style, as evidenced in later works like Hot and Bothered, where he masterfully blended Bubber Miley's muted trumpet with Baby Cox's scat singing. This technique evolved further in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone introduces the melody, showcasing Ellington's continued exploration of unique instrumental voices.",
            "What factors determine evolutionary patterns in organisms, and what limitations might shape evolutionary trajectories? Despite D'Arcy Thompson's 1917 observation about the lack of mathematical descriptions for biological forms - an observation that remains relevant today - progress has been made in applying mathematical models to understand mollusk shell development, both in individual growth and evolutionary history.\n\nOur research investigates how mathematical modeling of developmental and evolutionary changes in Prunum, combined with experimental work, can reveal mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental modifications. We analyzed X-ray images of Prunum species to identify measurable characteristics that could be used to model both theoretical and actual shell shapes using the CerioShell software. By modeling potential shell forms, we explored the boundaries of possible morphological variations in Prunum, integrating these findings with experimental and observational studies to better comprehend major evolutionary changes in this group.\n\nA mollusk shell can be conceptualized as a tube that rotates through space, creating 360-degree turns called whorls around a central axis (the columella). The growth rate of these whorls can vary, with suture lines marking the boundaries between them. The final whorl, known as the body whorl, is typically the largest, while the spire encompasses all previous whorls. The shell structure extends from the apex (top) to the base, with the aperture serving as the opening for the animal.\n\nShells can be examined from multiple angles: apical (top), basal (bottom), apertural (front), and abapertural (back). The standard presentation shows the aperture facing the viewer with the apex pointing upward. Whorl counting begins from the initial suture line when viewed from above, with measurements made to the nearest quarter whorl.\n\nThe shell's development can be understood as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. This growth pattern can be tracked using coordinates of aperture centers and their dimensions, allowing for mathematical representation and manipulation of shell development parameters.",
            "Indonesia's progress in reducing infant and neonatal mortality has been minimal over the past decade. Despite achieving several Millennium Development Goals, particularly in water and sanitation, the country's improvements in maternal and child health fall significantly behind target expectations for 2015. This underperformance stems from various factors that suggest a need for comprehensive health system enhancement rather than isolated program interventions.\n\nWhile Indonesia has achieved 72% coverage of births attended by skilled health workers, this figure includes traditional practitioners like midwives who lack capabilities to handle medical complications, particularly hemorrhage cases. This statistic, therefore, presents an overly optimistic picture of progress. Furthermore, there's been a reduction in professional treatment of childhood diarrhea cases, and postnatal care remains inadequate nationwide.\n\nThe country's cesarean section rate of 4% is below expected levels, with a notable urban-rural disparity (7% vs. 2%). This highlights significant geographical inequities in healthcare access. Additionally, a 27% gap in healthcare utilization exists between the wealthiest and poorest population segments, suggesting financial barriers to access, primarily due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn addressing these maternal and neonatal care challenges, Indonesia faces a strategic choice between targeted programmatic interventions and broader health system strengthening. While vertical, program-specific approaches offer focused objectives and quick results, they have significant drawbacks. These include resource diversion from other health sectors (as seen in HIV/AIDS funding impact on family planning), staff concentration in well-funded areas, and service duplication across uncoordinated programs, leading to increased administrative burden.",
            "Over the last century, Popular Music has evolved into such a vast array of genres that creating an exhaustive list has become challenging. Each major genre - including rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk - has developed numerous subdivisions and further subcategories. Heavy Metal rock, in particular, has emerged as one of popular music's most varied and emotionally rich genres in the past four decades. While often exploring darker themes, it demonstrates remarkable emotional range and adaptability. This flexibility has led to continuous branching into new sub-genres, creating an ongoing evolution that continues today.\n\nThe heavy metal landscape has become so diverse that defining its core characteristics has grown increasingly complex. While it has absorbed influences from various musical styles, understanding its origins is crucial. To comprehend contemporary metal music's widespread presence, one must grasp both its nature as a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal distinguishes itself as a movement characterized by intensity and darkness. It can be described as music of excess - featuring amplified bass, increased volume, heightened aggression, and theatrical elements. Unlike primitive music forms, metal demands technical proficiency, with musicians demonstrating exceptional instrumental skills. The movement was significantly influenced by the psychedelic drug culture of the mid-1970s, which led to experimental, otherworldly recordings. Metal introduced unprecedented dark, visceral qualities to popular music, which traditionally avoided such emotional territory. Modern metal also draws inspiration from the dark themes prevalent in the Romantic Era. This darkness is exemplified in various lyrics, including those from \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles, which some consider an early heavy metal song. The Beatles created this darker, heavier track to compete with the Rolling Stones' sound, including it on their White Album.",
            "Several decades prior to Surrealism's emergence, Henri Rousseau was already creating his own visionary artworks. His 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, carries dual significance - depicting both a woman's mystical dream experience and symbolizing Rousseau's personal artistic aspirations. Throughout his career, he yearned for artistic recognition while grappling with a fundamental choice: whether to adopt conventional painting styles for acceptance or maintain his distinctive creative voice.\n\nTo understand The Dream's significance, context about Rousseau's life is essential. Born in 1844 in Laval, France, to a moderately successful tinsmith, Rousseau lacked formal artistic training. Until age forty, he worked as a municipal toll collector, often mistakenly called a customs inspector. Personal tragedy marked his life, with his first wife Clémence's death following the loss of eight children, leaving him with just one daughter, Julia. Art became his solace and new beginning. Unlike his contemporaries who idealized peasant life in their works, Rousseau's perspective reflected his working-class background and aspirations.\n\nHis desire for artistic acceptance becomes more comprehensible given his circumstances: he began painting late in life without formal training, competing alongside established modern artists. Despite years of work, recognition came late, around the same time Matisse was gaining prominence. As Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters, their motivations differed fundamentally: while Matisse sought to avoid artistic conventionality, Rousseau desperately wanted to create conventional art that would earn him acceptance into the Artiste Français.",
            "Throughout history, philosophers have noted a profound relationship between moral principles and artistic beauty. This connection appears to stem from a deeper truth, as captured in Keats' famous lines from \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" about the unity of beauty and truth. Unlike conventional knowledge acquired through formal education or life experiences, our understanding of ethics and aesthetics seems to come from a more intuitive place. Both fields aim to describe rather than dictate, attempting to explain why we find certain actions moral or certain works beautiful, instead of providing strict guidelines.\n\nWhen analyzing art or moral behavior, we often find that conventional explanations fall short. Take the Mona Lisa, for instance - while we can discuss its technical aspects and historical significance, these elements alone don't fully explain its artistic merit. People often preface their appreciation of art with phrases like \"There's just something about it,\" suggesting an ineffable quality. This same phenomenon applies to moral understanding. As O'Connor suggests with storytelling, some truths can only be conveyed through indirect means, and both artistic and ethical appreciation possess elements that defy complete analytical description.\n\nThe connection between morality and art is particularly strong because both operate on a deeper, almost mystical level that we can experience but struggle to fully articulate - what Kant would call the noumenal realm. This relationship is especially evident in literature, which uniquely combines artistic expression with moral significance. As McKean points out, literature's distinctive feature is its moral dimension, making it particularly relevant to human experience since both living and literature inherently involve value judgments and ethical considerations.",
            "Modern Germany represents a unified nation with a distinctive cultural identity that spans from Munich near the Alps to Kiel by the Baltic Sea, and from Cologne along the Rhine to Dresden on the Elbe. This cohesive culture emerged from diverse tribal origins and multiple historical influences.\n\nThe ancestral homeland, Germania, has a name whose origins remain debated among academics. According to Tacitus, the name derived from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe that was known as Germans before their Rhine crossing and conflicts with the Gauls. The term \"Germanus\" was first documented by Julius Caesar in his Gallic Wars chronicles, borrowed from the Gauls to differentiate between conquered and unconquered peoples. Various theories suggest the name could mean \"neighbor\" in Gaulish, reference their \"ger\" spear, or stem from the Old Irish \"garim\" (to shout).\n\nTacitus's 98 AD work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" portrayed the Germans as indigenous people, largely unmixed with other groups. He argued that Germany's harsh climate and wild landscape made it an unlikely destination for voluntary migration from more hospitable regions like Asia, Africa, or Italy.\n\nEven the Romans maintained a limited presence in Germania, primarily engaging in trade and occasional military campaigns rather than permanent settlement. Germanic tribes, emerging in the mid-first century, established themselves along the Roman Empire's borders, trading goods and offering their military service to the Roman army while maintaining their independence.",
            "Shakespeare's Twelfth Night explores how disguise, while effective for temporary deception, ultimately demands resolution lest one's true identity becomes permanently obscured. The aftermath of revealing such deception often leads to social complications, forcing individuals to choose between maintaining their authentic selves or preserving their relationships. While some people might accept the revelation of deception gracefully, others may feel betrayed and respond with hostility.\n\nThe theme of gender-based deception raises particularly complex questions, primarily regarding motivation. In the case of Viola, her cross-dressing serves as a survival strategy in unfamiliar territory, as evidenced when she acknowledges the captain's help in preserving her safety through this disguise. However, this protective measure comes at a cost, isolating her from female companionship and creating unexpected romantic complications. Her convincing male persona leads to Olivia's misplaced affections and creates a complex dynamic with Orsino, who struggles with his feelings for someone he believes to be male.\n\nFor contemporary audiences, the play can be interpreted as an exploration of how deception can unveil hidden desires and emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. While one might question whether Olivia's attraction to Cesario suggests repressed same-sex desires, it's more likely that Shakespeare intended to satirize the superficiality of attraction based solely on appearances. This interpretation is supported by Olivia's quick transition of affections from Cesario to Sebastian, and her eventual acceptance of Viola as a sister rather than a romantic interest.",
            "The German colonial empire's legacy is complex, particularly regarding its educational policies across different territories. While infamous for acts of brutality, such as the Ovaherero and Nama genocide in German South West Africa, the empire's administrative approaches varied significantly by region. For instance, when British forces assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a considerable number of well-educated African inhabitants. Similar educational achievements were documented in Kamerun and other German colonies.\n\nHowever, German South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) developed quite differently. Unlike East Africa's government-led educational system, South West Africa delegated native education primarily to missionary organizations, offering them minimal state support. Conversely, the colonial government heavily invested in European settlers' education, creating state schools and providing substantial support to missionary institutions serving white colonists. This disparity resulted in lasting educational inequalities, with most of the native population remaining illiterate, unlike in other German colonies.\n\nThe academic literature on education in German colonies is extensive, with early 20th-century German sources focusing mainly on describing educational systems. Later English-language studies introduced comparative analyses and explored specific aspects of colonial education. Cohen's research, comparing South West Africa and East Africa, particularly emphasizes how the large settler population in South West Africa influenced its distinct educational approach.\n\nSouth West Africa's relatively moderate climate, despite its desert regions, attracted a significant European population. By 1913, it hosted nearly 15,000 white settlers, almost triple the European population in East Africa, the next most populated German colony. This demographic pattern significantly influenced the territory's social and educational policies.",
            "The United States and Mexico experienced a significant rivalry lasting 57 years (1836-1893), as noted by Diehl and Goerts (2000). This conflict reached its peak during the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), resulting in the US annexation of Texas and the Southwest. The antagonism, which persisted until just before WWI, was rooted in religious, cultural, and material differences between the two nations (Schmitt 1974).\n\nThis pattern is common among neighboring countries, where shared borders often lead to conflicting interests and rivalries. According to Pletcher (1977), Mexico and Cuba stand out as the only Latin American nations with sustained diplomatic tensions with the United States, while other countries in the region maintained positive relations.\n\nReligious differences played a crucial role in the conflict. Frahm (2001) notes that American opposition to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries paralleled their later resistance to fascism and communism. This religious-ideological divide, similar to the US-Soviet tensions during the Cold War, stemmed from inherited Anglo-Spanish antagonisms that complicated diplomatic relations between the two nations.\n\nDuring the 57-year rivalry period, Diehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 disputes, primarily involving territorial issues and border security problems. Both nations eventually had to deploy military forces to address cross-border bandit activity (Schmitt 1974).\n\nThe rivalry gradually diminished as Mexico became economically dependent on the United States, and American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic influence in Mexico during the late 19th century (Schmitt 1974).",
            "An unexpected illness left me disabled at age 46, completely transforming my life. As a nurse - a career I had chosen for its promised stability rather than pursuing my dreams of science or journalism - I found myself unable to work and financially vulnerable.\n\nAfter 15 years on disability benefits, I've lost nearly everything I once owned. Though I manage to survive, each day brings new challenges to my sense of security and self-worth. What's become crystal clear is that I couldn't have endured without the support of family and friends. When crisis hits, even the strongest among us need help.\n\nLife's emergencies, both major and minor, are inevitable. No matter how well-prepared we are, some challenges are simply too enormous to face alone. While I agree that Americans shouldn't rely solely on government support - which is already strained - I believe the solution lies in rebuilding community trust and mutual aid rather than isolating ourselves in individual preparation.\n\nThe common narrative about America being built on \"rugged individualism\" is misleading. Our ancestors survived through community, compassion, and resource-sharing. The pioneer wagons reached their destination through cooperation, not isolation.\n\nI advocate for personal preparedness - I maintain emergency supplies, from first-aid kits to non-perishable food. If you can manage sustainable living through farming or food preservation, that's wonderful. But more importantly, invest in your community relationships.\n\nThe real key to survival isn't just stockpiling supplies - it's building connections with those around you.",
            "Around 2500 years ago, in the 5th or 6th century BCE, the man who would become known as the Buddha was born into royalty. His journey to enlightenment and subsequent teachings formed the foundation of Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism emerging as its most traditional branch. The religion has evolved considerably since its inception, as evidenced in practices like Sri Lanka's annual water-cutting ceremony, which, despite having no direct connection to Buddha's original teachings, has become an important religious event for both monks and laypeople. These evolutionary changes extend beyond mere customs to affect the fundamental salvation principles of the faith. The Theravada Buddhist community has adapted its theological principles over time in response to various influences, both from within and outside the faith, some supportive and others antagonistic.\n\nFor clarity, several key terms require definition. Forces originating from within the Buddhasasana (Buddhist community), regardless of whether from monks or laypeople, are considered internal. Those from non-Buddhist sources are external. Hostile forces are those that aim to harm or undermine Buddhism, while benign forces are neutral in intent, though their effects may ultimately help or harm the faith.\n\nThe fundamental principles of Theravada Buddhism center on the triple gem: Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha. The Dhamma is preserved in the Tripitaka, or three baskets of Buddhist scripture: the Sutta Pitaka (discourses), Vinaya Pitaka (disciplinary rules), and Abhidhamma Pitaka (metaphysical teachings). Core concepts include Anatta (non-self), Dukkha (suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Understanding these principles is essential for ending Sansara (the cycle of rebirth) and eliminating lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The religion prescribes behavioral guidelines: five precepts for laypeople (prohibiting killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxication) and additional rules for monks. The foundation of Buddhist doctrine lies in the four noble truths, beginning with the recognition of suffering, its cause in attachment, and the possibility of its cessation."
